BURNEY, CA, UNITED STATES, November 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- On October 15, 2025, West Biofuels, a leader in renewable bioenergy solutions, celebrated the official ribbon cutting for Hat Creek Bioenergy, a biomass-to-energy facility which the company constructed and is operating. This flagship facility represents years of collaboration with local, regional and statewide partners and converts forest biomass into renewable power, supporting forest stewardship and providing clean energy directly to the local electrical grid.

The plant is a landmark achievement in sustainable forest management, providing a critical destination for forest biomass, which aids in wildfire mitigation efforts in the community. The project is also a significant driver of local economic opportunity, supporting a team of 15 skilled plant operators, most of whom are from the Burney community. The plant’s construction phase also provided over 60 short-term jobs to the region.

The facility supports the sustainable management of about five square miles a year of forested area by local licensed timber operators and their staff. The residuals from this forest management are delivered to the facility and converted into renewable electricity and carbon sequestering biochar. During the life of the facility, over a hundred square miles of forest area around the Burney community can be made and kept fire-safe, dramatically reducing the risk of a local catastrophic fire.

""This is a proud and exciting moment for our team, our partners, and this community,"" said Matt Summers, Chief Operating Officer of West Biofuels. ""This facility represents years of hard work and a shared vision where clean energy, forest stewardship, and economic opportunity go hand-in-hand. This is an ideal local solution for fire risk reduction"".

The project was made possible through a coalition of dedicated partners and investors. The company extended its deep gratitude to primary investors, Peter Paul and Mieko Willoughby, for their unwavering commitment.

Key grant support was instrumental in the plant's development. The California Energy Commission (CEC), in partnership with the Fall River Resource Conservation District, provided the foundational grant for the facility. Early support also came from the US Forest Service and the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Continued support from CalFire, including a Biomass Transportation Subsidy, will be vital for managing local feedstock transportation.

The ceremony featured a lineup of distinguished speakers, including:

• Justin Britton, Wood Products & Bioenergy, CalFire

• Angie Gould, Deputy Director in R&D, California Energy Commission (CEC)

• Gabrielle Stevenson, Assistant Deputy Director, Energy & Climate, GO-Biz

• Bruce Ross, Press Secretary, Office of Senator Megan Dahle

Assemblywoman Heather Hadwick was also in attendance to support the launch.

The West Biofuels team is incredibly proud of this achievement and thanks the local Burney community and state officials for their contributions in making Hat Creek Bioenergy a reality. Future projects will rely on continued support from key stakeholders in order to bring clean energy and healthy forest management practices to rural communities throughout California and the West. The Hat Creek Bioenergy facility is a model that can be replicated in other forest communities with the same vision and effort.

While lithium dominates headlines, every EV battery contains far more graphite by weight, up to 70 kilograms per vehicle. With China controlling over 90% of the processed graphite supply, Western nations are urgently seeking secure alternatives. That shift is creating a strategic opening for Australian graphite producers, many of which remain undervalued despite strong long-term demand. For investors looking beyond the lithium hype, graphite may offer a more grounded, geopolitically aligned battery play.

What are the Best Graphite stocks to invest in right now?

Check our buy/sell tips

Why Graphite Matters More Than Investors Think

Graphite plays a key role in lithium-ion batteries. It makes up 10–28% of the battery’s weight and acts as the main anode material, helping lithium ions move during charging and discharging. Without high-quality graphite, batteries can’t work properly.

What’s important for investors is the growing gap between supply and demand. Battery-grade graphite demand is forecast to grow 8–10x by 2030, driven by EV and energy storage adoption. Natural graphite mine output has grown modestly since 2018, but not fast enough to meet projected battery demand. That means producers may struggle to keep up.

For growth investors, this supply crunch could drive prices higher. For value investors, many graphite stocks are still trading well below lithium peers, despite strong long-term demand.

ASX Graphite Stocks Positioned to Benefit

As demand for electric vehicles grows, graphite is emerging as a key material, and these ASX-listed companies offer different ways to invest in the trend.

Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) – Vertically Integrated with US Support

Syrah is one of the few companies outside China actively producing natural graphite. It produced 26,000 tonnes of natural graphite at Balama in Q3 2025, according to company reports.

– What sets Syrah apart is its vertical integration; it processes graphite at its Vidalia plant in Louisiana, supplying battery-grade anode material directly to US customers.

– Recent US tariffs on Chinese graphite (totalling ~105%) have boosted Syrah’s competitiveness.

– The company’s cash position improved from US$43M to US$87M in Q3 2025, although US$60M remains restricted.

– Key risk: Balama faced a full production halt earlier in 2025 due to civil unrest. Political instability in Mozambique remains a concern for future supply.

Renascor Resources (ASX: RNU) – Australia’s Largest Reserve

– Renascor owns the Siviour project in South Australia, which holds the largest reported graphite reserve outside Africa.

– Strong project economics and low operating costs support long-term growth.

– Renascor is also building a downstream plant to produce purified spherical graphite, a higher-value battery material.

– A key milestone is the Q4 2025 commissioning of its demonstration plant, which will test its HF-free purification process and could unlock better margins.

International Graphite (ASX: IG6) – Modular, Low-Cost Strategy

– International Graphite is taking a staged approach to production, starting with a micronising plant in Collie, WA.

– Stage 1 will produce 4,000 tonnes per year, aiming for early cash flow from industrial-grade graphite.

– The company has already made initial sales from its ISO-certified R&D facility, showing market acceptance.

– International Graphite estimates AU$14.1M–AU$28M in annual revenue potential across its staged Collie operations.

– While smaller in scale than its peers, its capital-light model reduces risk and speeds up time to market.

Novonix (ASX: NVX) – Tech-Driven Synthetic Graphite

– Novonix focuses on synthetic graphite, using proprietary technology to cut costs and emissions.

– Its induction furnaces use 30% less energy and eliminate chemical reagents, making the process cleaner and more efficient.

– The company’s dry, zero-waste method reduces capital costs by ~30% and operating costs by ~50%.

– With US tariffs making Chinese graphite less competitive, Novonix’s domestic production is well-positioned to gain market share.

– Challenge: Synthetic graphite production can cost up to 10x more than natural graphite, though Novonix’s innovations aim to reduce this gap.

The Investor’s Takeaway

Graphite offers a quieter but promising alternative to lithium, with several ASX-listed companies well placed to benefit from rising demand and supply chain shifts.

– Syrah delivers near-term production and US market access, though Mozambique risks remain.

– Renascor holds Australia’s largest resource with government backing, but execution will be key.

– International Graphite offers a lower-risk, early-stage entry with modest scale.

– Novonix brings a tech-driven approach to synthetic graphite with cost and emissions advantages.

For investors looking at battery materials, graphite deserves serious consideration. Its higher usage per battery, supply constraints, and Western support for non-Chinese sources create strong long-term potential. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for production milestones and offtake deals before committing.",https://stocksdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Graphite-Stocks.png,N,,2025-11-11 00:58:27.783428

Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs.
“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella.
“By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”","ROCKFORD, Ill. – Working to provide more relief to Illinoisans facing rising energy costs, state Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, passed comprehensive legislation Wednesday evening that seeks to bring down home energy bills both immediately and in the long term for residents, while holding large utility corporations accountable.

“Every Illinoisan deserves affordable, reliable energy,” said Vella. “Families for too long have been paying the price for decisions made by big utility companies. This bill finally lowers the costs of utility bills while increasing accountability.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices by tapping into:

● Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

● Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

● Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents, lowering electricity prices by reducing overall demand, and improves equity in programs by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support

low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella. “By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”",,N,,2025-11-10 23:57:51.375888

Proposed Exemptions to PFAS Reporting Rule The TSCA PFAS reporting rule, originally finalized in October 2023, requires that manufacturers of PFAS and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products report extensive information to EPA about the products they manufacture and import going back to January 1, 2011 (See Hunton’s prior blog post about this rule).

It is intended to maintain meaningful reporting on PFAS while exempting entities that are “least likely to have relevant information.” Next Steps Stakeholders impacted by the TSCA PFAS reporting rule are encouraged to provide feedback to the agency on every aspect of the proposed rule, particularly the proposed reporting exemptions.","On November 10, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a pre-publication copy of its proposed rule to significantly reduce the scope of PFAS reporting under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Significantly, EPA’s proposal would exempt imported articles from reporting. Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, it will be subject to a 45-day comment period.

Proposed Exemptions to PFAS Reporting Rule

The TSCA PFAS reporting rule, originally finalized in October 2023, requires that manufacturers of PFAS and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products report extensive information to EPA about the products they manufacture and import going back to January 1, 2011 (See Hunton’s prior blog post about this rule). The rule does not include any of the exemptions that are traditionally part of TSCA reporting rules, which has caused widespread concern from regulated entities about the massive regulatory burdens created by the rule, particularly for importers of finished products containing any amount of PFAS.

EPA now proposes to add key exemptions to the reporting requirements, including for:

1) PFAS imported as part of an article;

2) PFAS manufactured or imported in a mixture or article below a 0.1% de minimis concentration;

3) PFAS that are impurities;

4) PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance (referring to the exemptions in EPA’s premanufacture notice (PMN) regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 720.30(h));

5) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates; and

6) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development (R&D) purposes.

Other than the de minimis exemption, these exemptions are typical of TSCA reporting rules, including the chemical data reporting rule (CDR). EPA is also requesting feedback on whether it should consider adding a production volume threshold by which reporting on a given PFAS would not be required, similar to the exemption in the CDR for chemicals manufactured or imported under 25,000 lbs. (or 2,500 lbs. for chemicals subject to certain TSCA actions).

Proposed Extension of Submission Period

EPA is also proposing to delay the reporting submission window, which is currently from April 13, 2026 – October 13, 2026. The new reporting window will start 60 days after the effective dates of the final rule and will last for three months rather than six months. EPA did not provide an update in the proposed rule regarding the status of the development of its electronic reporting application within EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX). EPA has experienced numerous delays in developing this reporting tool for the PFAS reporting rule, resulting in multiple delays of the submission period.

What Aspects of the Reporting Rule Are Staying the Same?

Based on the language in the preamble, EPA intends to retain the original reporting lookback period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022.

EPA is also maintaining its current definition for PFAS as including at least one of these three structures:

R-(CF2)-CF(R’)R”, where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons;

R-CF2OCF2-R’, where R and R’ can either be F, O, or saturated carbons; and

CF3C(CF3)R’-R”, where R’ and R” can either be F or saturated carbons.

While EPA is not proposing any changes to the definition of PFAS, it is taking comment on whether it should limit reporting to only PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or LVE number.

The specific data required to be reported to EPA, as well as the “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” due diligence standard, remain the same.

Purpose of Proposed Revisions

According to EPA, this proposed rule is intended to make the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements more practical and implementable and to reduce unnecessary, or potentially duplicative, reporting requirements for businesses while maintaining the ability to obtain important use and safety information on PFAS. EPA’s press release includes a statement from Administrator Lee Zeldin that the current TSCA PFAS reporting rule imposes “crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” whereas “today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing [EPA] to collect the information [it needs] to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

EPA is reassessing whether the volume of potential data collected justifies the total burden of implementing the rule and what Congress had intended when it added this requirement to TSCA Section 8. It is intended to maintain meaningful reporting on PFAS while exempting entities that are “least likely to have relevant information.”

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers.","The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) servers is being fuelled by the growing demand for generative AI applications, ignited by milestones such as the release of ChatGPT in 20221. Projections signal even greater impact, exemplified by the recent Blackwell platform, which analysts herald as a new Moore’s Law era2. Pronouncements from influential AI industry figures3 on both demand and supply sides are seen as transformative shifts for the entire data-centre industry. Whereas AI has been employed in various fields to advance sustainability4,5, the remarkable energy requirements of AI itself raise concerns regarding not only energy provisioning challenges6 but also water scarcity and climate change issues stemming from the energy–water–climate nexus of AI data centres1,7,8. However, the holistic energy–water–climate implications of AI computing are largely unknown, constrained by untransparent industry reports and limited data.

The climate impact of AI servers will stem primarily from their operations (Scopes 1 and 2)9 and supply-chain activities (Scope 3), including manufacturing and end-of-life treatment10,11. The Scope 2 emissions from indirect energy purchases are expected to constitute a substantial portion and indicate a high dependency on the increase of AI server energy consumption. According to the International Energy Agency12, 0.6% of global total carbon emissions comes from the data centres and data transmission networks due to their electricity consumption. The industry energy consumption could double by 2026, motivated by AI and other sectors13, threatening decarbonization targets under the Paris Agreement14,15, which include a 53% reduction in data-centre emissions by 2030 and net-zero goals for the AI sector. Further, growing AI server energy consumption implies an increasing water footprint through Scope 1 (direct cooling) and Scope 2 (indirect procurement) water use8,16. Centralized installation in water-stressed regions may perturb local water balance and threaten supply for millions17,18.

Previous research has developed bottom-up and top-down methods to assess energy–water–carbon outcomes of servers19,20,21, but these approaches face challenges with the rise of AI servers. Top-down approaches based on activity indices, such as data traffic and computing instances, fail to accurately represent AI-driven workloads22,23. Detailed bottom-up approaches suffer from limited data availability and lack of industry insight7. Assumptions valid for traditional collocation centres often fail for AI data centres, which differ in installation and operation24. Recent studies have explored computing task-based analyses to better quantify AI-related energy and resource consumption, providing insights but lacking systematic policy guidance25,26. Two notable contributions are the 2024 data-centre report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory27 and the 2025 Energy and AI Report by the International Energy Agency28, which present scenarios estimating US and global data-centre energy use under highly uncertain AI growth. Although use of confidential commercial data may limit reproducibility, they offer important benchmarks. Our study extends this foundation by (1) developing an open-source, bottleneck-based modelling approach with comprehensive uncertainty analysis; (2) systematically assessing energy, water and carbon impacts, incorporating dynamic interactions with local energy systems; and (3) proposing actionable mitigation strategies for potential net-zero trajectories across different AI server deployment scenarios.

Here we analyse the combined energy–water–climate impact of operational AI servers in the United States between 2024 and 2030, balancing importance and future uncertainties and addressing a series of fundamental questions. (1) What are the magnitude and spatiotemporal distributions of energy consumption, water footprint and climate impact from AI server deployment? We address this using temporal projection models and regional frameworks, assuming deployment mirrors current large-scale AI data-centre patterns. (2) What are the prospects for near-term net-zero pathways? We evaluate this by analysing best- and worst-case scenarios of key drivers, including industry efficiency improvements, server location distribution and grid decarbonization. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections.

Investment in AI servers is accelerating, as seen in projects such as the $500 billion Stargate3. While AI advancement is a key priority, our study highlights its environmental impact. To mitigate these risks, we identify that concentrating AI server deployment in Midwestern states—Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota—is optimal, given their abundant renewables, low water scarcity and favourable projected unit water and carbon intensities. These states possess substantial untapped wind and solar resources, enabling robust green power portfolios and reducing competition with other sectors. Their lower water stress also helps ease public concerns and reduces the need for costly water-saving measures. However, several implementation challenges must be acknowledged. Texas, crucial to the optimal strategy, may need to support an additional 74–178 TWh of AI server demand, possibly exceeding its current total renewable generation of 139 TWh (ref. 38). This scale-up would require substantial investment in new renewable capacity and transmission infrastructure, which is already constrained by existing congestion39. Meanwhile, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota currently host minimal data-centre capacity, indicating that most of their existing internet infrastructure may support only residential or standard industrial applications. This raises potential connectivity and security concerns for high-performance AI services. Enabling AI-grade infrastructure in these regions will require broadband and security upgrades, with associated emissions and capital costs increasing the expense of the optimal strategy. These challenges underscore the complexity of sustainable siting decisions and highlight the need for strategic coordination to ensure that AI investments support both technological leadership and long-term sustainability goals.

Expanding AI servers in the suggested regions may be further obstructed by public health concerns and other impacts on local sustainable development. Operational demands and construction of supporting facilities could generate air and water pollution through fossil fuel use, substantial water consumption and large-scale construction and transportation. To address these issues while managing economic costs, we recommend that AI companies engage in public–private partnerships with local governments. Such partnerships could alleviate governmental budget pressures, create local jobs and mitigate health concerns by funding green power upgrades and monitoring systems, such as tracking PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less) levels, through combined AI investment and regulation. For the governments, implementing tax exemptions on a related facility could incentivize a win–win development process, and it is essential to ensure transparent accountability within public–private partnerships to prevent privatized gains at public cost. Beyond environmental benefits, these measures could stimulate local economic growth, as evidenced in Virginia40. This discussion outlines policy recommendations for both industry and legislative stakeholders that balance economic and environmental impacts. They also emphasize energy market adaptations as AI-driven hyperscale loads challenge utilities‘ ‘duty to serve’. Requirements to connect large data centres could lead to server collocation with energy generation, but as shown in this study, these choices should not crowd out renewable investments to decarbonize the economy. Finally, the effectiveness of the recommended policy may be influenced by broader political and economic factors beyond the scope of this study.

The challenges associated with the optimal spatial distribution of AI servers introduce substantial uncertainties to the projected reductions of 73% and 86% in carbon and water footprints, respectively, under best-practice scenarios. These challenges are unlikely to be offset by improvements in efficiency or decarbonization efforts beyond what has already been considered. Our best-case scenario for industry efficiency approaches the physical limits of AI data centres. Moreover, projections from the US Energy Information Administration offer limited support for additional grid decarbonization compared with the considered best case41. These constraints suggest that, without additional interventions, AI data centres are likely to generate substantial environmental impacts in the coming years. Consequently, AI companies are expected to continue investing in the offset mechanisms, including power purchase agreement, carbon removal and water restoration, reaching an unprecedented level of reliance on them to accomplish their net-zero aspirations by 2030. Nevertheless, severe concerns could be raised regarding the complexity of securing long-term contracts and providing convincing reduction credits9,42, especially bearing in mind the considerable capacity that would be needed. We argue that AI companies should shift to a more transparent approach by closely cooperating with third-party verification groups, service providers and governmental agencies. Such collaboration could reduce uncertainties through better integration of social resources and serve as a model for other electrified sectors.

Emerging high-efficiency technologies in hardware and software, exemplified by DeepSeek43, may fundamentally transform AI server supply and demand. As reflected in the study’s five scenarios, these innovations may cause deviations of up to 393 million m3 in water footprints and 20 MtCO2-equivalent in emissions between minimum and maximum impact cases, underscoring the need for tailored managements. While efficiency gains may reduce cost per computing task, they risk a rebound effect, where lower costs increase total application volume. This dynamic, as reflected by the high-application scenario, may amplify total demand and complicate AI’s environmental trajectory. To address these uncertainties, we recommend government agencies work with industry to establish real-time monitoring systems, enabling timely alerts and proactive measures before considerable environmental impacts occur. Moreover, the potential increase in total computing jobs poses both challenges and opportunities, calling for ongoing enhancements in energy and water efficiency through system optimization and adoption of strategies such as SUO and ALC to manage the added workload complexity and flexibility. Therefore, we also suggest the data-centre industry establish AI-specific benchmarks for energy, water and carbon performance, which is crucial for continuous operational efficiency gains.

The methodology framework of this study aims to achieve two goals: (1) draft the energy–water–climate impacts of AI servers in the United States from 2024 to 2030 to handle the massive concerns about AI developments, and (2) identify the best and worst practices of each influencing factor to scheme the net-zero pathways for realizing water and climate targets set for 2030. Compared with many previous climate pathway studies, which often extend predictions to 2050 for better integrating climate goals, this study focuses on the period from 2024 to 2030 due to the great uncertainties surrounding the future of AI applications and hardware development. For assessing these uncertainties, scenario-based projections are first constructed to obtain potential capacity-increasing patterns of AI servers. Technology dynamics, such as SUO and ALC adoption, are defined with best, base and worst scenarios, and a similar method is employed to capture the impact of grid decarbonization and spatial distribution. The utilized models and data required during the calculation process are illustrated in the following sections. More details on model assumptions and data generation are provided in sections 1–4 of Supplementary Information.

Data description and discussion

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the data used in this study. Historical DGX (Nvidia’s high-performance AI server line) parameters were sourced from official documentation, and future scenarios were projected on the basis of historical configurations and current industry forecasts. To attain the units of AI servers, we collected the most updated industrial report data for projecting the future manufacturing capacity of CoWoS technology, which is the bottleneck for top-tier AI server production. The data resources of the preceding process have been introduced and validated in section 1 of Supplementary Information. AI server electricity usage was assessed using recent experimental data on maximum power44,45, idle power44,46 and utilization rate46,47,48,49, derived from existing AI server systems. PUE and WUE values for AI data centres across different locations were calculated using operational data from previous studies30,50 and industrial resources51, combined with the collected average climate data for each state52. The allocation ratios of AI servers to each state were determined on the basis of configurations of existing and planned AI data centres, which are collected from reports of major AI companies in the United States, as data resources detailed in section 2 of Supplementary Information. In addition, projections for grid carbon and water factors were derived from the ReEDS model31, using its default scenario data33. All datasets employed in this study are publicly available, with most originating from well-established sources. A key uncertainty lies in estimating the number of manufactured AI server units, as official supply-chain reports remain largely opaque. To maintain transparency and ensure reproducibility, we rely on the best available industry reports rather than commercial sources such as International Data Cooperation data53, which are not granted for open access and would limit future validation despite their potential to provide better estimates. The validations of applied data are further detailed in sections 1 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

AI server power capacity projections

The energy consumption of AI servers is projected to be driven predominantly by top-tier models designed for large-scale generative AI computing6,7. This trend is attributed to their substantial power requirements and the increasing number of units being deployed. In this study, we estimate the power capacity of these high-performance AI servers by examining a critical manufacturing bottleneck: the CoWoS process54. This process, which is controlled nearly exclusively by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, serves as a key determinant of the manufacturing capacity for AI servers in recent years55. Our analysis uses forecast data and projection assumptions of the CoWoS process to estimate total production capacity. Other factors are integral to translating this capacity into the power capacity of AI servers: the CoWoS size of AI chips, which determines how many chips can be produced by each wafer; the rated power of future AI servers, which reflects the power demand per unit; and the adoption patterns of AI servers, which dictate the mix of various server types over time. The values of these factors are derived mainly from the DGX systems produced by Nvidia, which is the dominant product for the top-tier AI server markets56.

Considering the influencing factors for the total AI server capacity shipments and existing uncertainties, we generate distinct scenarios as follows:

Mid-case scenario: the CoWoS capacity is projected to slightly increase after 2026, consistent with the growth rate in 2023. Under this scenario, AI servers’ rated power is expected to have a linear relationship with the anticipated die size increase while adoption patterns remain aligned with current trajectory.

Low-demand scenario: characterized by lower CoWoS capacity growth and lower AI server rated power compared with the mid-case scenario, this reflects a scenario of lower overall demand for AI servers.

Low-power scenario: maintains the same assumptions as the mid-case scenario but with lower AI server rated power, representing efficiency gains in AI hardware and software development.

High-application scenario: assumes lower AI server rated power alongside high CoWoS capacity, capturing the potential rebound effect where efficiency gains drive increased AI workload deployment.

High-demand scenario: features higher CoWoS capacity expansion, higher AI server rated power and higher adoption of new servers compared with the mid-case scenario, reflecting a scenario of strong AI server demand.

Based on the assumptions and scenarios outlined, the annual projections for top-tier AI server shipments and their average rated power are calculated as follows:

$$\begin{array}{l}{N}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\frac{{C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\times {R}_{\mathrm{Nvidia}}\times {\sum }_{i}{R}_{i}{n}_{i}}{{N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}}\\ {\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}{R}_{i}{P}_{i}\end{array}$$

(1)

where \({N}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) and \({\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) represent the annually projected shipments and average rated power of the top-tier AI servers. \({R}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) is the ratio of CoWoS capacity allocated to top-tier AI servers and is set as 40% for 2022, 40.7% for 2023, 48.5% for 2024 and 54.3% for 2025, according to industry reports57,58. For years beyond 2025, this ratio is assumed to remain constant at the 2025 value due to a lack of further data. The sensitivity analysis regarding this value is provided in Fig. 6. \({C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\) is the projected CoWoS capacity within each scenario. \({N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}\) is the number of graphic processor units (GPUs) per server and is set as 8, reflecting the configuration of most commonly used AI server systems59. In addition, \({R}_{i}\), \({n}_{i}\) and \({P}_{i}\) represent the projected adoption ratio, units yield per CoWoS wafer and rated power of the ith type of chip at each year, respectively. The details of the projections and related data resources are provided in section 1 of Supplementary Information, Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Table 1.

AI server electricity usage calculation

The applied AI server electricity usage model is a utilization-based approach initially derived from CPU (central processing unit)-dominant servers60 and can be written as the following:

$${P}_{\mathrm{server}}=({P}_{\max }-{P}_{\mathrm{idle}})u+{P}_{\mathrm{idle}}$$

(2)

The preceding model assumes the total server power has a linear relationship with the processor utilization rate u. While this relationship has been well validated for CPU machines, its application to GPU utilization is less established except for a few cases61. However, several recent studies have shown a strong correlation between GPU utilization and overall server power consumption when dealing with AI workloads44,46, indicating that GPUs are the dominant contributors to energy use in AI servers45. Although systematic experimental validation specific to GPUs is still limited, the consistency of findings across various case studies supports the assumption that the linear relationship applies here as well. The maximum power \({P}_{\max }\) and idle power \({P}_{\mathrm{idle}}\) are generated on the basis of the recent DGX system experimental results, and their values are set as 23% and 88% of the server rated power, respectively44,46. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the uncertainty, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Moreover, the GPU processor utilization \(u\) is calculated as the following:

$$u={u}_{\mathrm{active}}\times {r}_{\mathrm{active}}$$

(3)

where \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) represent the average processor utilization of active GPUs and the ratio of active GPUs to total GPUs, respectively. Note that the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) commonly have higher values during training compared with inference62. Specifically, we use currently available AI traces, including Philly trace47, Helios trace46, PAI trace48 and Acme trace49, to determine the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) for training and inference tasks. These traces provide comprehensive analyses on the relationship between GPU utilization rate and job characteristics. Based on the data provided in these works, the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) is set as 50% and 90% for inference and training, respectively. Moreover, the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) values are further determined on the basis of recent experimental studies44. The values are set as 50% and 80% for inference and training, respectively. Therefore, the processor utilization rates for inference and training in this work are set as 25% and 72%, respectively. Following the previous works63,64, our base estimations assume 30% of computing capacity for training and 70% for inference. A detailed sensitivity analysis on the impact of these utilization rate settings is provided in Fig. 6.

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers

This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. To capture the current and future distributions of AI server capacity, we compiled data of current and in-construction large-scale data centres belonging to major purchasers of top-tier AI servers, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, AWS, XAI and Tesla. The analysis incorporates the location, building area and construction year of each data centre to calculate the state-level distribution of server capacity by annually aggregating the total building area for each state. On the basis of our calculations, no major changes in spatial distribution are projected between 2024 and 2030, even with the anticipated addition of new data centres. Therefore, we assume the current spatial distribution will remain constant from 2024 to 2030 to account for uncertainties in directly integrating the projected contributions of in-construction data centres. Further details on the methodology and spatial distribution results are provided in section 2 of Supplementary Information.

For each state, the actual energy consumption can be derived from the server electricity usage and the PUE value of AI data centres. Meanwhile, the water footprint and carbon emissions should be analysed across three scopes. Scope 1 encompasses the on-site water footprint, calculated on the basis of on-site WUE (shortened as WUE in this work) and on-site carbon emissions (typically negligible for data centres18). Scope 2 includes off-site water footprint and carbon emissions, which are contingent on the local grid power supply portfolio. Scope 3, representing embodied water footprint and carbon emissions during facility manufacturing, lies beyond the spatial scope of this study. A regional PUE and WUE model, following the idea in previous research30,50, is applied to estimate the PUE and WUE values of AI data centres in different states. This hybrid model integrates thermodynamics and statistical data to generate estimations on the basis of local climate data. Specifically, we collected the average climate data of each state between 2024 and 2030 from an existing climate model52, which is then employed in calculating the PUE and WUE values of each state. Considering that the specific cooling settings for AI data centres are unknown, the base values are calculated by averaging the worst and best cases. The model parameters are detailed in Supplementary Table 2. Subsequently, the Scope 2 water footprint and carbon emissions are calculated on the basis of the grid water and carbon factors derived from the ReEDS model31. This approach also allows us to incorporate the projected data-centre load data, which can further interact with the grid system through services such as demand response. The validation of the ReEDS model results by using current high-resolution data is presented in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8, and the related discussion is presented in section 4 of Supplementary Information. Optimization and analytical techniques are employed to determine optimal parameters during the simulation to generate the best and worst practices concerning industrial efficiency efforts, spatial distributions and grid decarbonization. Moreover, the water scarcity and remaining renewable energy potential data of each state are computed on the basis of the calculated environmental cost and standard data from previous literature18,65. The preceding calculation process depends mainly on previously established approaches, and its integration into our framework is further discussed in sections 3 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

Uncertainties and limitations

There are substantial uncertainties inherent in projecting the evolution of AI servers. Our analysis presents a range of scenarios based on current data to evaluate the impacts of data-centre operational efficiency, spatial distribution and grid development. However, several key uncertainties remain an unmodelled field for this work. For a better understanding of our study and to outline future research directions, these uncertainties are categorized as follows:

Model and algorithm innovations: the model and algorithm breakthroughs in the AI industry could fundamentally alter computing requirements.

Supply-chain uncertainties: the complex production process of AI servers may reveal new bottlenecks beyond the current CoWoS technology, leading to varying expansion patterns.

Hardware and facility evolutions: continued improvements in AI computing hardware and data-centre efficiency may substantially affect the environmental impact of these servers.

Out-of-scope factors: there are other major contributors that are out of the scope of this study and would be critical to the process, such as market forces and geopolitical influences.

The impacts of these factors are multifaceted and challenging to model with existing data. For example, while the recent release of DeepSeek has been interpreted as reducing the energy demands of AI servers, it may also trigger a rebound effect by spurring increased AI computing activity, ultimately resulting in higher overall energy, water and carbon footprints43. However, no fresh data have become available to simulate this complex process, based on our best knowledge when drafting. To further assess the influence of unpredictable uncertainties, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on key factors, including manufacturing capacities for AI servers, US allocation ratios, server lifetimes, idle and maximum power ratios and training/inference distributions. As shown in Fig. 6, our findings suggest that the key conclusions of this study are expected to remain robust as long as the impact of future uncertainties does not notable exceed the ranges considered. Given the highly dynamic nature of AI evolution, our modelling approach allows for future revisions as more data become available on potential shifts in industry trends.

She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry.
The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding.
“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said.
The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation.","Upon entering Heidi Vanderlee’s railroad apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a visitor will hear her two cats purr from opposite ends—but will not see or smell anything unusual apart from that. The threat from pollutants wafting out of the Meeker Avenue Plume, a contaminated Superfund Site under the four-story building, is invisible.

“I’ve lived within the plume without knowing it the whole time,” said the 40-year-old entertainment publicist.

It’s Vanderlee’s third apartment in the neighborhood since moving to Greenpoint in 2008. She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry. While she lives on the third floor and the vapors primarily affect the lower levels, she feels that every tenant in the building should know if they are at risk of breathing in hazardous chemical vapors seeping through foundation cracks and dirt floors. Long-term exposure to these vapors is known to cause cancer, reproductive health problems, and nervous system damage. The landlord never told Vanderlee and tenants of the other seven units because he was never required to — and that is what she and others are trying to change by pushing a new state-level right-to-know legislation that would make Superfund Site disclosure mandatory.

“My landlord wants our rent and not to be bothered,” said Vanderlee about her landlord, who owns four buildings in the plume and lives in one of them. “He won’t do stuff if he’s not legally required to do it. He doesn’t even get his own building tested.” (NYCity News Service could not independently verify this claim.)

The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been in charge of investigating the full extent of the contamination from this site in the area of Brooklyn that potentially affects 1,000 buildings — and developing a cleanup plan. To determine whether a building is affected by vapor intrusion and needs mitigation vents, the EPA must take air samples inside. While this testing is free, landlords must give permission.

“That is absolutely the hardest thing,” said John Brennan, EPA’s remedial project manager. Landlords deny access for many reasons. However, most often “people don’t want to know,” or are afraid that it might negatively affect their property values, said Brennan.

Tenants have been frustrated with that tendency to ignore what could be a serious problem. The issue has come up at many community meetings—usually attended by 15 to 25 people, and sometimes as many as 50—as well as in individual conversations, said Brennan. In September 2024, the EPA estimated that 25 landlords had outright denied the agency access for testing. “The number has probably gone up slightly since that time,” Brennan added. Vanderlee, who is a member of the Meeker Community Advisory Group, which is the point of contact between the EPA and the local community, attributes the reticence of landlords in the area to “greed” that is “pretty gross,” she said.

The EPA can enforce testing in some cases, but only for very compelling reasons and on a case-by-case basis, Brennan says, for example, if the tenant is pregnant and much more at-risk for the health issues arising from the plume. The last time the EPA enforced testing was in early 2024.

Even after a building is tested, surrounding residents have a hard time getting a hold of the results because of privacy laws. Instead of releasing the individual results of the 240 tested buildings, the EPA published cluster maps, which only give a rough idea of where contamination hotspots are. Residents are pushing back against this opacity.

“If there is a contamination problem of this scale, I think the tenants should have a right to know,” said Anne Ray, 46, a fiction writer who has lived within the plume-affecter area since 2017.

She discovered the plume from an EPA flyer on her door. Worried about harming her good relationship with her landlord, Ray didn’t want to bring up testing again. She said that her landlord had previously denied her request in 2023. However, an official rule that would enforce testing would go a long way towards convincing a “law-abiding” person like him, she said, but no such rule currently exists.

“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said. “And it makes me feel angry.”

The Meeker Community Advisory Group has been trying to push legislation that would require landlords to disclose potential Superfund exposure at the state level for about a year, and things seem to be moving. The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, who represents District 50, including Greenpoint and parts of Williamsburg, said in a statement that she “would absolutely support legislation that provides tenants with more transparency and agency, and I look forward to its introduction.”

Natalie Vichnevsky, 49, a member of the advisory group, noted that such a legislation would be “something to build on.”",https://cdn.nycitynewsservice.com/blogs.dir/9/files/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-10-at-8.03.18-PM-1152x759.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:19.014125

The funding deal also allows the company to call on an additional $6M of equity funding should the need arise, for a total investment of up to $16M.

The funds will be used to scale production of the Company’s proprietary organic flow battery electrolyte beyond the United States and demonstrate its efficacy in real-world field pilot demonstrations by pairing it with commercially available flow battery hardware.

“The close of our Series A funding round represents a key milestone for Quino Energy on our mission to establish our safe, low-cost flow batteries as the leading solution for mid- to long-duration energy storage, as well as for multi-cycle per day applications,” said Eugene Beh, Co-Founder and CEO at Quino Energy. “Because our organic electrolyte can be used in vanadium flow battery hardware with minimal modification, we will be able to scale rapidly in partnership with our friends and allies in the flow battery industry. The new electrolyte factory we are planning will enable production at a cost lower than vanadium, the incumbent flow battery electrolyte. Ultimately, we expect to come in at just one-quarter the cost of vanadium at GWh scale and bring big cost reductions to the entire flow battery industry.”

Quino Energy’s flow battery technology and electrolyte production process present numerous strategic advantages in today’s energy storage and utility markets, including a lower cost floor compared to lithium-ion systems and far below that of vanadium flow batteries. The company’s organic flow battery electrolyte is created through an innovative, zero-waste continuous-flow production process, using inexpensive and abundant feedstocks derived from coal tar. Besides being backward-compatible with mature, established vanadium flow battery hardware, Quino Energy’s mildly alkaline, chloride-free electrolyte is also broadly compatible with carbon steel tanks ubiquitous in oil storage infrastructure that could be repurposed as battery storage facilities.

""Atri, a company headquartered out of Hyderabad, India, focuses on providing 'Socially Relevant & Economically Viable' Energy Transition solutions to users at large – all driven by access to cutting-edge technologies. At Atri, we believe that the world needs reliable, sustainable yet commercially viable alternatives for LDES needs, quickly,” said S Kishore, Founder of Atri Energy Transition. “Quino Energy’s organic electrolyte can revolutionize the energy storage sector by enabling large scale deployment of commercially-viable LDES solutions. We are excited to partner with Quino and believe that this partnership will lead to penetration of flow battery technology across the world.""

Earlier this year, Quino Energy received a $10M grant from the California Energy Commission and $5M in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Critical Facility Energy Resilience (CiFER) program to support a 5 MWh flow battery deployment in Southern California. Quino Energy also secured a strategic agreement with TerraFlow Energy to advance organic electrolyte chemistries for use in large-format flow battery solutions in June 2025. The company has also previously received funding through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO) to support the development of its pilot electrolyte production line in Buffalo, New York.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued Ozone Action Day alerts for 41 of those days.

In October, the state environmental commission issued eight alerts. That was a drop from September, which saw 14 ozone alerts issued, the most of any month this year, according to data from the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the agency tasked with monitoring Fort Worth-Dallas air quality.

Such alerts are issued when smog is forecasted to exceed the federal limit of 70 parts per billion.

Ozone measured between 71 and 85 parts per billion is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups including young children, older adults, people with respiratory conditions and those active outdoors, according to the council of governments.

The alerts inform the public when weather conditions are favorable for ozone so they can adjust daily routines to minimize health risks and exposure to unhealthy air conditions. The alerts also serve businesses and industries, urging them to mitigate emissions, such as those generated by cars and power plants.

By Nov. 10 last year, 43 alerts were issued for Fort Worth-Dallas. While alerts have yet to be issued this month, the public could see additional days of high levels of air pollution as ozone season begins in March and runs through November, according to the state environmental commission.

Exposure to ozone can cause health issues such as chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing, irritation and congestion. The gas can also exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and cancer.

Major polluters in North Texas could face annual fines of $45 million if ozone is not brought down to or below 70 parts per billion by 2027 under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act.

Whether companies in violation will see those fines is uncertain as EPA officials propose changes to deregulate energy companies.

Within days of his presidency, Donald Trump vowed to roll back federal regulations. That includes revoking the scientific finding from 2009 that allows the EPA to enforce climate change-focused regulations on cars, power plants and other major sources of greenhouse gases.

In June, the EPA announced the closing of its Office of Research and Development, which analyzes health dangers stemming from toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants and water pollutants, according to a report from National Public Radio.

The proposal to revoke the 2009 scientific finding requires a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it can be finalized next year, according to the Public Broadcasting Service.

Environmental advocacy groups are expected to challenge the ruling in court if implemented.

Meanwhile, the council of governments is developing the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan, a several hundred page document consisting of strategies to improve North Texas air quality.

The council of governments has until Dec. 1 to submit the plan in order to be considered for federal grant funding.

Those estimates put the annual resource consumption of the AI industry in the range of the entire state of New York.
Despite the sobering forecast, You and his fellow researchers are optimistic about the possibility of addressing the issue of data centers through sound policy.

With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.","When Cornell University systems engineer Fengqi You started modeling the environmental footprint of data centers three years ago, the AI boom was just beginning. Even then, You and his colleagues noticed something missing from the conversation.

“When we started this, we saw that AI was growing very fast,” You said. “It was clear it would have to be aligned with power-grid planning, with water and other resource planning. There were no discussions about these topics—but we wanted to bring real numbers, rigorous analysis on AI’s physical footprints.”

You and his team’s new paper, published Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, delivers those numbers—and they’re enormous. Depending on how fast the AI industry expands, the authors predict U.S. data centers could annually consume as much water as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars. Those estimates put the annual resource consumption of the AI industry in the range of the entire state of New York.

Despite the sobering forecast, You and his fellow researchers are optimistic about the possibility of addressing the issue of data centers through sound policy. The report highlights the necessity of decarbonizing the electrical grid, improving energy and water usage efficiency inside data centers and moving the AI industry to areas of the country better suited to its sustainable development.

“We’re still early in this growth, it’s in our hands now,” You said. “It’s not too late yet to do the planning and accounting for resource constraints that could let AI continue to grow.”

Where to Build—and Where Not To

The study highlights that from one state to the next, the environmental cost of AI looks radically different. It breaks down grid mixes and water resources state by state to show how the data center boom will affect various parts of the country differently, and outlines policy suggestions that can mitigate its impact.

The world’s densest data center hub remains Northern Virginia’s “data center alley” outside of Washington, D.C., where the industry clustered itself over decades because of tax breaks, fiber infrastructure and proximity to federal agencies. Now that the demand for data center construction is exploding, You warns that Northern Virginia “won’t have enough resources to support the growth of the AI industry in a sustainable way, there are too many constraints in terms of energy and water.”

The report projects that through 2030, Northern Virginia will continue to be the dominant location for data center construction, despite the area’s resource constraints. That’s why, You argues, policymakers need to be pushing companies now to start looking away from Northern Virginia and toward states with more sustainable prospects for the AI boom.

“The key point we’re trying to make is that for the new projects, we have a chance to decide right now,” You said. “And we need to think about somewhere else.”

The study points to Midwestern states in particular, where water availability and the potential for renewable energy infrastructure could help mitigate the strain that data center construction exerts on resources and emissions.

“States like Texas, Montana, Nebraska, for instance, they have enough water supply and have good targets for getting clean energy and sufficient power supply,” You said.

By redirecting AI infrastructure to these regions, the researchers argue, the U.S. could sharply reduce the environmental impact of the industry without a major slowdown in its growth.

A Fork in the Road for Climate

The paper’s findings arrive amid escalating alarm over AI’s growing appetite for electricity and resources. With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.

A report released last month by the Center for Biological Diversity estimated that, if current trends continue, data centers in the United States could account for nearly half of all emissions from the power sector that current national climate targets would allow.

The report warned that “because of expected fossil fuel–reliant AI data center growth, all other electricity-consuming sectors would need to increase their carbon-emissions cuts by 60%” in order to still meet the United States’ 2035 climate target.

Jean Su, one of the report’s authors, told ICN that despite the current obsession with AI, “unfettered data center growth is not an inevitability.”

“Technology optimists are saying AI is going to solve the climate emergency and cure cancer,” Su said. “But the way to actually resolve the climate emergency is to phase out fossil fuels. Scientists have already told us how to do it, we don’t need AI, we just need political will.”

But political headwinds in the U.S. are blowing in the opposite direction, with President Donald Trump gutting renewable energy projects and vocally championing the use of coal and gas. “Projections show that data centers are going to be powered by fracked gas through 2035,” Su said, “and that’s in the political interest of the president and in the interest of the fracked gas industry.”

Su stressed that the public interest needs to become part of the conversation around data center construction, with residents given the opportunity to weigh in on whether new projects in their home states will actually benefit them.

You’s study shows that the Biden administration’s 2035 climate goals—slashing greenhouse gas emissions across the economy and transitioning the U.S. power sector away from carbon pollution entirely—remain technically achievable, but only if AI infrastructure aligns with major policy changes. The authors point to the need for tighter regulation, greater transparency and AI-specific benchmarks for energy and water usage, not unlike fuel efficiency standards for vehicles.

The study adds to a growing body of reports which emphasize how the next few years will be crucial in determining how the AI boom affects climate issues in the United States. According to Su, the country must decide who this new technology will truly serve.

“We can’t let billionaire corporations dictate policy while the rest of us pay the price,” she said. “We have to ask what’s actually in the public interest.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2217198248-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:01.647787

By the same token, the region could be well-positioned to capitalize on robust reshoring incentives.

Thanks largely to Michiganders, the U.S. exports $79 billion in motor vehicles (fourth after pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels and aerospace technology). The U.S., however, imports $146 billion in motor vehicle parts, each one affecting sticker prices and, in a sense, the fortunes of businesses of every size.

Deloitte, realizing the myriad questions that changes to trade policy raise for U.S. manufacturers, recently analyzed the current landscape and offered guidance to industry leaders. The bottom line: Companies must remain agile while balancing resilience and cost.

New policies, new impacts

According to Deloitte’s report, “Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience in a New Era of Policy,” U.S. manufacturing growth has been trending positively for more than a decade. Manufacturing establishments increased from roughly 334K to 410K from 2013 to 2024, and construction spending rose by $181 billion over the same span.

However, also on the rise is supply chain volatility. U.S. manufacturers, impacted by the pandemic, geopolitical dynamics, trade tensions, rising costs and labor shortages, have reshored or nearshored their supply chains in recent years. Supply chain strategy is likely to continue to evolve as the current administration seeks to prioritize and incentivize domestic manufacturing. In fact, a recent survey by The Conference Board of over 1,700 global C-Suite executives found 71% of CEOs plan to alter their supply chains over the next three to five years.

Tax, regulatory and energy policies are also affecting supply chain decision-making. Despite this, 78.2% of respondents to a Q3 2025 National Association of Manufacturers survey cited trade uncertainties as their top business challenge.

Canada and Mexico are critical factors in supply chain decision making. Motor vehicles are the top imports from these neighbors, who along with China are the U.S.’s top three trading partners. And motor vehicle parts are the U.S.’s number-three imported manufactured product category, $82 billion of which comes from Canada and Mexico. New surcharges on imported steel and aluminum could further affect domestic auto manufacturing decisions.

Looking ahead to further manufacturing growth

Deloitte’s report offers several considerations that could help manufacturers bolster growth in this uncertain environment.

Conduct scenario planning. Assess a range of potential trade-policy effects on manufacturing costs. Map exposure based on the country of origin for parts and materials, and factor in potential for trade deals or reactions from trading partners.

Implement near-term strategies. Consider front-loading imports to secure inventory. Seek to renegotiate supplier contracts based on new trade costs. Apply for any available exemptions or exclusions. Evaluate transfer pricing strategies and assess first sale for export customs valuation structures.

Evaluate overall supply chain strategies. In addition to near-term tactics, manufacturers may need to consider reconfiguring the supply chain for long-term advantage. Key decision factors include availability of skilled labor; tax, regulatory and energy policy; proximity to key plants and customers; and geopolitical risk.

Improve the worker experience. Use digital tools to attract and retain talent and take an ecosystem approach to hiring and developing the workforce.

Monitor the landscape. Manufacturers can continuously watch for potential changes in trade policy and key economic indicators (e.g., inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence).

These actions can help companies prepare for whatever comes next, even though predicting exactly what that is can be challenging. In any case, U.S. trade policy could affect Michiganders.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/ind_man_glb_ho_2158_lo.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:29.904203

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio totals 32.8 MTPA of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana. The companies previously announced that Baker Hughes will supply compression equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG project.

Its annual fee is 0.56%, still expensive compared with passively managed ETFs, but more competitive within the niche space of nuclear energy funds.
The Global X Hydrogen ETF NASDAQ: HYDR is currently the only pure-play hydrogen fund available and could benefit significantly if this growth materializes.
While Global X Uranium ETF currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","The renewable energy industry faced numerous challenges in 2025, including a rollback of clean energy tax credits, the imposition of new restrictions, and other hurdles. Investments in wind and solar fell 18% year-over-year (YOY) for the first half of 2025. Nonetheless, energy capacity growth in the United States remains highly focused in the renewables corner, representing more than 30 gigawatts year-to-date (YTD) as of September.

Some experts predict renewables deployment could continue to grow into 2026, in spite of supply chain pressures, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and a shifting policy landscape. Some sections of the alternative energy market—specifically, nuclear energy and clean hydrogen—may be particularly attractive to investors, thanks to surging demand from data centers and a more supportive position from both sides of the political aisle. With that in mind, the three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) below are worth keeping an eye on heading into the new year.

URA Is a High-Flying Uranium Equities ETF

The Global X Uranium ETF NYSEARCA: URA provides a targeted play on the expected long-term resurgence in uranium demand. With estimates suggesting reactor demand could double by 2040, URA offers investors exposure to a portfolio with 50 uranium-focused equities.

The ETF is highly concentrated in two of the biggest names—Cameco Corp. NYSE: CCJ and Oklo Inc. NYSE: OKLO, representing 22% and 14% of the portfolio, respectively—but is otherwise fairly diversified.

URA also has a position in the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust Fund OTCMKTS: SRUUF, providing some exposure to physical uranium.

About two-thirds of the portfolio represents companies based in Canada or the United States, two key centers for the uranium industry.

URA has shone brightly this year, climbing by about 87% YTD. Though it is fairly expensive with an expense ratio of 0.69%, investors expecting this rally to continue may find the cost to be well worth it.

NLR Offers Broader Nuclear Exposure With Lower Fees

Investors seeking a slightly cheaper alternative to URA might turn to the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF NYSEARCA: NLR. NLR is also a globally-focused ETF with a broader mandate that covers companies related to all aspects of the nuclear energy industry. This means that NLR's basket includes mining firms, companies that build nuclear reactors, those that produce energy from nuclear sources, and more.

While the strategy is broad, NLR's portfolio itself is narrower than URA's.

NLR has only 27 holdings, and it is highly concentrated—more than half of its assets are invested in just 10 companies.

Nonetheless, NLR is a popular option among investors seeking wide exposure to the nuclear industry as a whole, while those favoring a uranium-focused strategy might opt for URA instead.

NLR has also posted impressive results this year, climbing by about 74% YTD. Its annual fee is 0.56%, still expensive compared with passively managed ETFs, but more competitive within the niche space of nuclear energy funds.

HYDR Bets on Hydrogen's Explosive Growth Potential

Clean hydrogen has massive growth potential, with production estimated to increase by 28 times in the next five years. The Global X Hydrogen ETF NASDAQ: HYDR is currently the only pure-play hydrogen fund available and could benefit significantly if this growth materializes.

Still, investors should keep in mind that this fund is small (it has just $81 million in managed assets and has a low one-month average trading volume of around 71,000) and therefore higher risk than some other options in the alternative energy space.

HYDR's portfolio is narrow, aligning with the relatively small corner of the market dedicated to clean hydrogen technology and production.

The fund holds just 26 positions, with the largest two representing a combined half of the invested funds. Still, investors willing to take the risk might find that HYDR's sizable returns of about 104% YTD make it quite compelling. Additionally, the fund's expense ratio is 0.50%, which is lower than the other two ETFs on this list.

""By recharging to 80% of the SOC, degradation mechanisms are reduced, which prolongs battery life.
The adoption of up to 80% recharge shows how Preserving batteries is essential for the advancement of electric vehicles.","Understand why partial charging dominates the technical specifications of current electric vehicles.

Although many drivers question this practice, automakers provide information on charging times up to 80% because this area concentrates the maximum charging powerin addition to protecting the battery lifeTherefore, this disclosure presents more efficient figures that are consistent with real-world use.

From the start, the batteries achieve better performance between 20% and 80%Since they receive energy with less resistance. However, when this value is exceeded, the vehicles automatically reduce power to preserve the internal cells. In this way, the final stage becomes slower and more sensitive.

How does the reduced charging speed work?

As the industry explains, the loading process involves exothermic electrochemical reactions...which release heat throughout the charging process. Therefore, in the last 20%, the temperature naturally increases. And, for this reason, the charging rate decreases, preventing... internal damage to the lithium-ion complex.

The technical explanation from the SAE Brazil expert.

Second Maria de Fátima RosolemAccording to , a member of the SAE Brazil Electric Vehicle Technical Committee, the final stage of recharging is the most critical phase. She states that Excess energy can generate additional heat., which causes irreversible damage to the structures of the cells. In this way, frequently completing the 100% This increases system stress, reducing autonomy over time.

Why recharging to 80% preserves the battery.

Consequently, when recharging up to 80%By reducing the natural mechanisms of degradation, the driver can mitigate the effects of the electrical system. Even if this limits some of the range, the practice prolongs the lifespan and improves the stability of the electrical system. ""By recharging to 80% of the SOC, degradation mechanisms are reduced, which prolongs battery life.""""That's why the limit functions as a..."" Rosolem reinforces. protection strategy widely used in the industry.

Calibration is required for some models.

Although not all vehicles prominently display this information, some models occasionally require a full recharge to calibrate the battery's internal reading. Despite this, the ideal daily charging level is up to 80%.

Key points about the procedure:

• Maximum power occurs between 20% and 80%.

• Above 80%, the car reduces the charging speed.

• Charging to 100% frequently accelerates degradation.

• Recharging up to 80% protects the lithium-ion battery pack.

• Some models require occasional full load to calibrate the system.

What does this practice mean for the future of electric mobility?

The adoption of up to 80% recharge shows how Preserving batteries is essential for the advancement of electric vehicles. Furthermore, this technical choice reinforces the importance of balancing autonomy, efficiency, and durability.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-10-de-nov.-de-2025-01_28_19.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 21:11:17.109315

Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.
“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement.
Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.
“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England.","BELEM, Brazil — The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

Danger signs

The planet’s annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.

Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia’s Siberia.

Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.

Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan, China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.

Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That’s the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.

Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world’s seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it’s enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.

Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.

Success in bending the curve

But there’s also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.

Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.

“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. “You cannot hold back the tides.”

In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.

But that’s nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement’s overarching goal.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,” Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.”

A report examining dozens of indicators of progress — such as solar and wind power installations — in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.

The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.

“Technologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,” said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. “But it’s not nearly fast enough for what’s needed.”

Pollution keeps growing

Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.

Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China’s going up 15.5% and India’s soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.

Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. “Unfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can’t say it’s failed. But then nor can you say it’s dramatically succeeded.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Climate-summit-2015-AP.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:33.866691

Virtual power plants gaining momentum

In its third-quarter investor presentation Thursday, Sunrun said it had more than 106,000 customers enrolled in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs. That figure is up over 400% from a year ago. Sunrun expects enrollments to continue rising in the years ahead, and estimates $2,000 in value per participating subscriber.

Sunrun already has 3.7 GWh of dispatchable battery capacity online and aims to have 10 GWh active by the end of 2028, it said. The company operates one of the United States’ largest virtual power plants, with 416 MW dispatched last year across 17 active VPP programs, CEO Mary Powell said Thursday.

As a leading U.S. installer of residential solar and energy storage systems, Sunrun is well-suited to grid flexibility programs, it says. It has more than 1 million customers, more than 217,000 of whom have solar with attached battery storage. In the second quarter, the most recent period for which it provided data, Sunrun said it accounted for 21% of residential solar installations in the U.S. and 42% of energy storage installations.

Though Sunrun also sells solar and storage systems directly to customers, it says leasing subscriptions account for more than 95% of its sales.

The subscription model — also known as leasing or third-party ownership — allows it to retain ownership of and monetize the equipment it installs through federal clean energy investment tax credits, tax equity financing and participation in VPP programs. Sunrun has 36% of the U.S. market for solar subscriptions, according to its third-quarter investor presentation.

Sunrun said Thursday its emphasis on subscriptions will also help it avoid a widely expected sales cliff when the federal tax credit for customer-owned solar systems expires at the end of next month. While analysts foresee the U.S. solar market contracting as much as 30% in 2026 and 2027, Sunrun said it expects “positive volume growth and margin expansion” next year.

Steady battery attachment growth

Powell and other Sunrun executives have repeatedly touted Sunrun’s shift to a “storage-first” posture following unfavorable changes to net metering policy for solar-only customers in key markets like California.

The strategy appears to be paying off with steady growth in Sunrun’s battery attachment rate for new customers, which rose from 60% in Q3 2024 to reach 70% in the second and third quarter of 2025.

Powell said Sunrun’s attachment rate is growing quickly in markets beyond the sunny southwestern United States. In Massachusetts, for example, attachments surged from 10% at the start of 2025 to more than 50% in the third quarter, she said. And Sunrun has circled back to attach storage for more than 2,000 solar-only customers, a market Powell said would be key for long-term value creation.

“We believe this will … produce strong expected upfront margins for Sunrun and serve as an accelerant to growth in our distributed power plant capacity,” she said.

Focus on subscriber value from solar leases

Sunrun’s subscriber value reached $52,446 in the third quarter, up 11% from a year ago. After accounting for customer acquisition costs, net subscriber value was $13,205, up 38% year over year.

Aggregate subscriber value, or the total value of all Sunrun subscribers, rose 10% year over year to reach $1.6 billion. Creation costs rose just 3% year over year to land at $1.2 billion. Sunrun attributed the increased margin to operational efficiencies, cost controls, growth in higher-value offerings like its Flex product and support from the federal clean energy investment tax credit, which extends through 2027 for third-party owned solar and battery systems. Those improvements that outpaced the added costs of attaching storage at more customer sites, Sunrun said.

At the same time, subscriber additions declined 1% year over year to just over 30,000 in the third quarter.

Powell declined an analyst’s request for guidance on installation volumes in 2026, saying Sunrun is focused on subscriber quality over quantity.

We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance.
One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS).
If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.","Capacity to build EV batteries far outstrips demand globally, a new report says.

It's worst in China, but the overcapacity issue exists in every major market and poses financial risks for battery makers.

Material and production costs are still high, which means EVs often aren't cheaper than gas cars, reducing demand.

The electric vehicle world has a new problem: too many batteries.

Capacity for building EV batteries outpaces demand for those batteries in every major market, a new report from consulting group AlixPartners claims. In North America, there is 1.9 times as much capacity as demand. In Europe, the capacity-to-demand ratio is 2.2.

And China, there is an absolutely stunning flood of capacity: 5.6 times as much battery-building capacity as there is demand for batteries. With tariffs restricting the country's EVs and components from major markets, too, it's a tenuous time to be a Chinese battery supplier. But, frankly, it's not like things are going better in the rest of the world, as AlixPartners Senior Vice President Rohit Gujarathi explained to me.

EV battery manufacturing capacity far outstrips demand for EV batteries, putting the industry under pressure.

""At the industry scale, globally, really five times the demand versus three times the demand is not really very different. No matter where you go at this moment, the capacity is still way beyond what the demand is,"" Gujarathi said in an interview. Because even if North American capacity looks better on paper, it is under-supplied in some ways. There's very little local production of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for instance, which offer lower costs and better durability at the expense of density.

But there's little incentive to build new capacity right now, as existing plants are already overbuilt for current demand, the report says. There are specific challenges that have driven overcapacity in specific markets: heavy incentive spending in China, the U.S.'s own EV incentives and the European Union's aggressive regulations. Overall, though, a key factor has been that consumers just have not responded to surging electric options the way automakers, experts and regulators anticipated.

The main reason they haven't, Gujarathi says, is cost.

""What consumers care about is: 'What's the price of the vehicle?'"" he said.

""Does it make economic sense to me? The point of view right now is, in most cases, no, especially as a lot of government support has been taken away,"" he added. Despite abundant supply pushing down prices, EV battery production and material costs remain high, and companies cannot sell them for less than they cost to build in the long term. Already, this instability is putting financial pressure on battery firms.

This comes as the U.S. has now removed its federal tax credit and rolled back emissions standards that pushed automakers to offer zero-emissions vehicles. The result will likely be a contraction in the EV market, but no one can quite say how big of a drop we'll see. The numbers weren't great last month, but they also reflect that many consumers pulled forward purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expired on September 30.

Regardless, a shrinking market won't help the capacity-to-demand ratio. AlixPartners expects it to grow to 2.4 by 2028 and stay around that level through 2030. This reflects the firm's earlier revision of North American EV penetration in 2030. Last year, it predicted that 36% of new vehicle shoppers in the U.S. would buy EVs in 2030. This year, it revised that figure down to 18%—a 50% drop in predicted demand.

The result will likely be further consolidation of existing battery plants and efforts, including deals like the one in which General Motors sold off its stake in a battery plant it once shared with LG Energy Solution. Gujarathi said he also expects to see companies launch LFP battery factories in the U.S. to address the cost problem.

This tracks, as we already know GM is putting North American LFP batteries in the new Chevy Bolt. But overall demand for these low-cost EVs remains unproven, so expect companies to stay agile. We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance. But regardless of how exactly companies manage the excess supply, the uncertainty of today's market is certain to impact the future of affordable EVs.

One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS). If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.

""What this mean is holding back on some of the investments that may happen in the future,"" Gujarathi said. Companies have to prepare to swap out technologies, battery chemistries and model plans as the situation develops.

""Everybody right now is in a holding pattern, because the ground is shifting underneath them,"" he said. It may be like that for quite a while.

On Nov. 9, 2025, the Senate agreed to vote on the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, to end the current government shutdown and fund portions of the federal government through a continuing resolution (CR) that would expire Jan. 30, 2026. The CR keeps current federal funding levels and applies to agencies such as CDC, HRSA, SAMHSA, and EPA. The rest of the federal government, including programs within the Department of Agriculture, FDA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the operations of Congress would be funded through full fiscal year appropriations bills expiring on Sept. 30, 2026. The bill also specifies a number of requirements related to federal workforce, state reimbursement, and spending which are detailed in the sections that follow.

Outlook

Considering the bipartisan support for this deal to end the government shutdown, the ASTHO Government Affairs team is tentatively optimistic that the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, will eventually become law. However, the current political environment is volatile and if anything changes, we will issue another legislative alert. After the Senate votes on the bill, which may be delayed due to negotiations on some agriculture provisions, the House will need to approve it by a simple majority vote. If the House fails to garner enough support, then the government shutdown will continue.

Here is the full text of the bill open_in_new, the text of various extenders open_in_new, and a section-by-section summary of all sections open_in_new by the Senate majority.

Federal Workforce and State Finances

Requires the return of all federal workforce levels prior to the current lapse of appropriations on Oct. 1, 2025.

Requires that funds be apportioned to agencies at a rate that would prevent the furlough of any employee during the duration of the CR.

Prevents agencies from overspending funds for grant programs during the CR period, unless funds are required to be spent for the programs during such period. It preserves the funding level for most grant programs, subject to Congress’s decision in the full-year appropriations acts.

Explicitly states that agencies should spend money in the most limited way possible during the duration of the CR.

Directs that funds provided by the CR are available to pay federal employees who were furloughed or excepted during the lapse.

Requires reimbursement to states that carried out federal programs, to prevent a reduction in service, during the lapse.

Prevents statutory PAYGO sequestration cuts to Medicare, agriculture, and other programs.

Agriculture and FDA

Specifically, Senators agreed to advance a three-bill package that includes FY26 funding for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration (Ag-FDA) open_in_new, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. The Ag-FDA bill open_in_new provides:

A hemp products ban, which prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.

$8.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for WIC.

$460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to assist low-income seniors.

$37.8 billion in mandatory funding for child nutrition programs, as requested by the Administration.

$107 billion in mandatory funding for SNAP, as requested by the Administration.

Reimbursement for both the SNAP and WIC contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.

$7 billion (budget authority and user fees), a decrease of $70 million below FY25 enacted levels, for FDA.

$1.2 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service.

$4.1 billion to support rural development across the country including $1.4 billion to prioritize aging water and wastewater infrastructure.

This paper examines whether information about the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s clean energy provisions affects public support for renewable energy policies. In a pilot survey experiment I conducted, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (1) a general description of the clean energy provisions of the IRA, (2) a jobs-focused framing, or (3) a message about the IRA's potential repeal. A control group received no information. Preliminary results suggest that respondents exposed to any treatment express lower support for expanding the IRA, particularly Republicans. Although most acknowledge that the IRA creates jobs, this does not lead them to view the policy as beneficial for their communities and decreases support for green energy policies. On the other hand, unemployed respondents and respondents who did not know about the IRA have higher preferences for expanding the IRA. I also examine a quasi-natural experiment embedded in the survey experiment comparing ""Energy Communities""-areas receiving IRA funding-with similar areas that do not. Support for the IRA, especially among Republicans, suggesting that direct material exposure may increase support.

That’s 73 gigawatts of solar and 43 GW of storage, for a total of nearly 116 GW in new capacity that could be lost or delayed at a time when the U.S. energy system is in desperate need of new generation to meet the rising demand for electricity.

This risk is the result of a U.S. Department of the Interior’s order for increased federal oversight of solar and wind projects issued in July. The order requires any project involving federal land, permits, or rights-of-way (including those on private land) to go through a lengthy review process, culminating in the direct approval of Interior Secretary Burgum himself. It has been widely perceived as an effort to hinder the buildout of renewable energy.

The threatened projects span 44 states; in 18 of those, over 50% of planned electricity capacity is at risk, according to SEIA.

Roughly 40% of the at-risk projects are in Texas. Nearly 45 GW of the solar and storage capacity planned between 2026 and 2030 in the state hasn’t emerged from the oversight process yet, which means that the federal government could still delay or condition approvals.

Other states with a large amount of at-risk capacity include Oregon, with over 7 GW, California, with nearly 6 GW, and Nevada, with 4.7 GW.

The new risk of unpredictable opposition from the federal government adds to the existing list of threats to solar projects across the country. For the past few years, renewable developers have seen a surge in opposition to local projects, and community resistance and local ordinances have been identified as the “leading causes of project delays and cancellations,” on par with grid interconnection issues.

Delays are particularly widespread, with a recent EIA analysis finding that “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay” in the third quarter of 2025. Those delays are especially common in the late construction or testing phases, right before they come online.

However, at least when it comes to delays, things are moving in the right direction; EIA found that fewer projects reported delays in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, at 25% of planned capacity.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-10T180237.461.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:02:16.788305

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers.
Still, low risk does not mean no risk.
Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes) In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market.
In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years.","Homeownership has long gone hand in hand with stability. But that relationship is shifting. Insurance premiums are rising. Property taxes are climbing. In some parts of the country, escrow payments, which are made up of property taxes and homeowners insurance, now exceed the cost of principal and interest.

Much of this cost increase is due to environmental risk. Although it's not always visible on a closing contract, variations in property risk profiles are redefining the market. Choice is increasingly driven by exposure.

Proximity to wildfires, floods, and hurricanes is pushing buyers to reconsider not just what they can afford — but where. And this divide is growing, according to Cotality data*. Concerns about safety and stability are reshuffling housing markets, and in the long-term, geography will define affordability.

Hundreds of counties across the U.S. are sheltered from severe natural catastrophe risk. But sheltered does not mean immune. So, when homes in these areas aren’t built for the unexpected, the consequences can be catastrophic.

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers. “We need to make sure that people understand what a risk score means since it’s only valuable if it can be translated into future resilience. That means tilting the conversation on physical property risk toward cooperation between homeowners, policymakers, and developers for long-term living solutions.”

Zoning laws, building codes, and home construction influence the resilience of properties and can tip a county from simply sheltered to future resilience. The opposite is also true. Without careful consideration for the resilience of individual homes, already vulnerable communities can slide into a very risky future.

Where is it safe to live in the U.S.?

Safest large counties (50K+ Homes)

These five counties benefit from low exposure to natural perils as well as a high number of homes that are built with low-risk profiles. They’re not immune—but they’re better positioned to weather the storm.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties have the advantage of a combination of elevation, inland location, and moderate weather patterns. That means fewer insurance claims, more stable premiums, and less disruption from natural disasters. In places like Skagit and Whatcom, wildfire risk is low, and flood exposure is limited. In El Paso, hurricane risk is virtually nonexistent. Still, low risk does not mean no risk. Homes across counties face varying degrees of exposure, which is why it is crucial to understand the individual risk profiles of every property.

Safest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller counties are also showing strong climate resilience—especially in parts of Colorado and Georgia.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are far from coastlines, sit at higher relative elevations, are surrounded by attenuating open land, or have historically low exposure to extreme weather. That translates to fewer disruptions from weather events and more predictable housing costs. In Summit County, for example, snow is common—but wildfire, flood, and storm risk remain low.

Where is it risky to live in the U.S.?

Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes)

In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market. Insurance costs are rising, and rebuilding after disasters is becoming both a financial and a logistical challenge.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties face the triple threat of hurricane storm surge, flooding, and wind damage. In New Orleans and Galveston, storm surge and sea-level rise are persistent threats. In Biloxi and Pascagoula, repeated hurricane landfalls have made insurance harder to access and more expensive to maintain.

‍

Riskiest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller coastal counties are also under pressure. Many residents are losing homes, insurance coverage, and land—literally.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are on the front lines, seeing the consequences of a changing environment. In the Louisiana counties of Plaquemines and Cameron, land loss from erosion and sea-level rise is accelerating. In Hancock, Mississippi and Lafourche, Louisiana, repeated storm damage has made rebuilding more expensive and less sustainable. These risks are already pricing out many homeowners.

Natural disaster risk is a housing cost

The old adage that real estate is all about location has never been more true. In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years. That adds hundreds of dollars to monthly payments and can tip the balance for buyers who are already stretched.

But where someone buys property is no longer about just building wealth. The choice is now defining long-term safety, stability, and affordability.",,N,,2025-11-10 23:04:00.203998

Under the agreement, Baker Hughes will supply the project’s main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. The company has also made a strategic investment to support project development.

The announcement was made in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in attendance, underscoring the administration’s support for expanding domestic LNG infrastructure.

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy,” added Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

The Trump administration has framed the partnership as a strategic move to strengthen U.S. energy independence and international energy leadership. “By forging this alliance and investment in Alaska LNG, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence,” Burgum said.

Glenfarne is developing the Alaska LNG project in two phases.

Phase One will include an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline transporting natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet in-state energy needs. Engineering firm Worley is expected to complete final cost analysis in December ahead of a final investment decision.

Phase Two will add an LNG export terminal with 20 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) of capacity, targeting a final investment decision in late 2026.

Since assuming leadership of the project earlier this year, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments for more than 60% of planned capacity, including agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc., and POSCO International Corporation.

Under the Advancing Renewables Program, this latest investment will support SunDrive in its collaboration with leading solar cell equipment manufacturing players Maxwell and Vistar to scale and commercialise its copper metallisation solar cell technology, from R&D at its Kurnell facility in New South Wales, to a 300 MW commercial scale production tool.

SunDrive’s copper-based process replaces silver in solar cells, aiming to cut costs and improve efficiency, supporting ARENA’s Ultra Low-Cost Solar goal. By building and testing new tools and upgrading its facility, SunDrive is working to bring this Australian innovation closer to real-world use, helping to reduce the cost of solar panels and supporting the growth of clean energy.

The funding will support SunDrive to upgrade its Kurnell facility to enable local development, deployment and refinement of production tools to further advance the technology, as well as undertake cost modelling to support the commercialisation pathway. Modules will be produced at SunDrive’s facility for in-field testing and early market acceptance.

These efforts will accelerate the adoption of copper-based solar cells and generate new licensing revenue streams for SunDrive.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said ARENA has been a long-term supporter of SunDrive, watching them grow from humble beginnings in a Sydney garage to a leader in solar innovation.

“By tackling one of the biggest cost items in solar cell manufacturing, SunDrive is demonstrating how Australian research can drive next-generation solar innovation. Not only is copper more abundant and cheaper than silver, but SunDrive’s unique manufacturing process also results in higher cell and module efficiencies which could have huge benefits for global decarbonisation efforts,” Mr Miller said.

“We’re providing a further $25 million in funding to help scale up SunDrive’s technology which could significantly help push the boundaries of efficiency and affordability and unlock the potential of ultra low-cost solar.”

SunDrive CEO Natalie Malligan said this funding marks a major step in SunDrive’s journey, taking the leap from world-leading research to commercial reality.

“It’s a strong validation of our strategy to develop world-class solar innovation here in Australia and partner with the best in the industry to industrialise it. It shows how Australian innovation can compete globally, and how with the right support, we can take homegrown technology to the world.”

SunDrive Co-Founder Vince Allen said together with Maxwell we’ve already broken world records in cell efficiency.

“This next phase builds on that success and represents the culmination of our work to translate our copper plating technology into the industrial tools that will define the next generation of solar cell technology. With silver prices nearly tripling in three years and solar now using a third of global industrial silver, the industry urgently needs a silver-free alternative. With ARENA’s support and our partners’ expertise, this project intends to deliver a scalable mass-production solution.”

The project builds on previous ARENA funding of $14 million to demonstrate SunDrive’s copper metallisation technology. To date, ARENA has provided over $388 million to over 200 solar research and development projects.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that executives at Ford Motor is in “active discussions” about scrapping the F-150 Lightning, quoting “people familiar with the matter”. It comes just a month after the company said it was pausing production. The unnamed sources had little else to say about these discussions except that no final decision has been made.

If true, the death of the Ford F-150 Lightning could spell trouble for electric pickup trucks, or utes, in the United States.

Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning in May of 2021 and delivered the first model a year later. It has never been officially released in Australia although some specialist importers have brought in some models, mostly for industrial and mining clients.

At launch, the F-150 Lightning boasted driving range of 370 kilometres for the base level, and up to 480 kilometres for the extended range option. The tech-heavy Flash model with an extended-range battery delivering range of up to 515 kilometres was brought to market in late 2023.

But despite huge interest and expectations at launch and over the first few years of its lifespan, the F-150 Lightning has failed to deliver on the promise of a “smartphone that can tow 10,000 pounds” – a claim made by Ford CEO Jim Farley at the car’s launch.

Despite promises that the car would sell around the $US40,000-mark, actual prices were closer to $US50,000 for the base-level model, and up to $US90,000 for higher end models.

Demand has therefore been lacklustre, and the car has subsequently been costing Ford billions since 2023. The future is even less rosy, with sales that are already well below expectations set to suffer from the withdrawal of government support for electric vehicles.

The writing may have been on the wall last month when Ford announced that it has pausing production of the F-150 Lightning.

Announced in late October, Ford first blamed the decision on a fire at one of its aluminium suppliers’ factories but matched that explanation with a concurrent ramp up of production of its F-150 gas and hybrid models, citing “strong customer demand” and claiming that these models “are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminium”.

If Ford does in fact scrap the F-150 Lightning, it will likely take solace from reports across the industry in the US. Executives at crosstown rival General Motors (GM) have reportedly been discussing discontinuing its own electric trucks, according to more unnamed people “familiar with the matter”.

Another big-name rival, Stellantis, announced in September that it was cancelling its own plans for an electric pickup, citing the slowing of “demand for full-size battery electric trucks” in North America for its axing development of the RAM 1500.

Meanwhile, Tesla has seen sales of its Cybertruck pickup plummet in 2025.

According to numbers from Cox Automotive published last month, Tesla sold only 5,400 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, bringing the total number sold so far in 2025 to only 16,000 – well behind the 250,000 a year that CEO Elon Musk once declared was possible.",https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/F150-with-caravan-US-pic-V2.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 22:04:03.110357

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat.
Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades.","The data center boom has catapulted Virginia into a serious energy crunch. We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM.

Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history.

More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.

All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads.

A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.

Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it.

I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?

Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission.

Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage.

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.

According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)

The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.

Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.”

The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant.

You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get.

Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states.

Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid.

But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?

I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.

But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25% — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.

This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into.

Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.

An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption.

Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.

The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.

Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments.

The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail.

Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.
Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026.
“Tesla has acted unlike any car company.
For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.","Tesla shareholders just overwhelmingly backed CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented pay package that could be worth $1 trillion over a decade, but engineers running the company’s main vehicle programs, for its top-selling Model Y, Model 3 and the controversial Cybertruck, aren’t sticking around to see how things turn out.

Emmanuel Lamacchia, an eight-year Tesla veteran and program manager for the Model Y, said late Sunday in a LinkedIn post that he was leaving the Austin-based company. His announcement came just a few hours after a similar post by Siddhant Awasthi, another eight-year veteran who ran the Model 3 and Cybertruck programs. Neither gave reasons for their decisions, though both mentioned new career steps, which they didn’t detail.

They’re just the latest high-profile engineers to leave as Musk seeks to shake up Tesla’s business, prioritizing AI-powered businesses – namely robotaxis and humanoid robots – that don’t generate revenue currently, rather than selling more electric vehicles, batteries and charging services, which do. Earlier this year, Musk fired the company’s head of manufacturing and sales in North America and Europe. In August, the director of Tesla’s battery team left the company, as did the head of its former “Dojo” supercomputer team and vice president of North American sales and service. Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.

“There are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction”

Aside from the fact that the poor-selling, much-derided Cybertruck ranks among the auto industry’s biggest flops, Musk’s prioritization of non-EV businesses is making the company less attractive to auto engineers, according to a former Tesla executive.

“Imagine you’re someone who's been working in the automotive industry or studying engineering at university and you go to Tesla and there are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction,” said the person, who asked not to be named. “This isn’t exciting at all. They cannot be attracting the best people in the automotive industry.”

The most recent departures didn’t ruffle shareholders. Tesla rose 3.7% to $445.23 in Nasdaq trading on Monday.

Despite a spike in deliveries in the third quarter, the result of U.S. customers rushing to buy before federal tax credits phased out after Sept. 30, Tesla’s EV sales are down about 6% so far this year. Though the company has come out with cheaper versions of Model Y and 3, its global top sellers, its lack of new products and the slower pace of EV sales in the U.S. and Europe suggest the next few quarters will see a continued drop in its auto sales.

Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026. But that car is intended to be sold without a steering wheel and standard controls, operating exclusively as a self-driving vehicle. That’s a gamble, though, given that the company continues to struggle to prove it’s equaled Alphabet’s Waymo in mastering autonomous driving.

Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor and critic of Musk’s shift in strategy, thinks it would be better to simply release Cybercab as the so-called Model 2, “just a regular EV that they could sell for about $30,000,” he told Forbes.

“The thing about how car companies work is people want new models, new features and they want new designs for their car that's not too different than the original, but is different,” said Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, which manages about $4 billion, including $80 million of Tesla shares. “Tesla has acted unlike any car company. They just refreshed the model Y and said, ‘Okay, we refreshed the car. We made it better and made the Model 3 better.’ But it's not a new model, and that’s the problem.”

Sales of the Cybertruck, which Musk once claimed would sell hundreds of thousands of units annually, are already dropping in the model’s second full year, down 38% through the third quarter to just 16,097 units. Aside from its polarizing styling, the truck has also had multiple recalls, the most recent announced last month.

Though Tesla is preparing to finally start selling its electric semi truck in 2026, according to Musk, that model is likely to only add tens of thousands of new sales to the bottom line, given how much smaller the Class-8 semi industry is compared to the broader passenger vehicle market.

Tesla claims to have the capacity to produce at least 2 million vehicles annually at plants in California, Texas, China and Germany. That’s considerably more than it needs at the moment, with annual sales likely to come in between 1.5 million and 1.6 million this year. At last week’s shareholder meeting, in which at least 75% of investors voted in favor of awarding Musk $1 trillion of stock over a decade if he hits a series of financial and strategic goals, the billionaire hinted it’s likely to absorb some of that surplus by making robots.

“We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here.”

The company is building a “million-unit production line in Fremont,” to make Optimus, Musk said. At some point, it will also add a “10 million unit per year line” at the Austin, Texas, plant that now builds Cybertrucks and Model Ys. Much like his robotaxi and Cybercab plans, however, Tesla’s ability to build and sell millions of units of Optimus depends on making the tech workable and affordable, which it has not done yet.

The departures of Lamacchia and Awasthi also underscore a continuing problem that Tesla’s board appears uninterested in solving: the lack of a strong executive team and a clear succession plan for the post-Musk era. Beyond its CFO, Tesla’s C-suite currently has no president, COO or executive vice presidents, or officials with titles higher than senior vice president.

For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.

“I cannot imagine a scenario where the valuation of Tesla does not collapse following Elon Musk's departure,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here. Normal key man risk doesn't even apply – and in particular doesn't apply when you're talking to someone who has, by his own admission, behaviors that are remarkably risky.”

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials.
At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.
“This unprecedented operation highlights the growing need for specialized battery recycling capabilities as electric vehicles, grid storage systems and consumer electronics continue proliferating,” the company says.
“The work being done on this cleanup between industry leaders and regulators is establishing safety and materials management standards for future large-scale battery facilities while demonstrating the viability of domestic recycling solutions for critical battery materials.”","ABTC says the lithium-ion battery cleanup is the “largest in U.S. history,” with $30 million in estimated project proceeds.

Battery materials recycler and refiner American Battery Technology Co. (ABTC), Reno, Nevada, has been contracted and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to recycle the end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from what it calls the largest LIB cleanup operation in EPA history.

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials. The company notes it has been receiving large-scale shipments of this material for the past several weeks.

According to the company, the cleanup effort comes after a fire at a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) facility in Northern California in January, which affected up to approximately 100,000 LIB modules that would require specialized handling, packaging, transportation and recycling in accordance with procedures overseen by the EPA. In the spring, ABTC says it underwent an audit and review process and successfully received formal EPA approval for its battery recycling facility in Nevada to receive waste material under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).

ABTC says it now is EPA-approved as one of the only battery recyclers in the Western U.S. capable of receiving batteries that have been damaged and classified as “CERCLA waste,” such as battery materials that have been involved in large-scale BESS thermal events and fires.

“This unprecedented cleanup effort highlights the critical importance of building and deploying advanced domestic critical mineral recycling infrastructure capable of addressing the growing challenges of managing damaged lithium-ion batteries in a safe and responsible manner,” ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert says. “We are proud that we have established ABTC as one of the only recyclers in the Western U.S. to be capable of receiving CERCLA materials, and that we have already been processing truckloads of CERCLA material from this project for the past several weeks.

“This effort is not just about safely recycling damaged batteries—it’s about answering President Trump’s call to action for implementing immediate measures to increase American mineral production through demonstrating how U.S.-based infrastructure can rise to return these critical minerals back to the domestic manufacturing supply chain.”

ABTC says its internally developed recycling technologies can recover valuable critical materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, steel and copper from damaged batteries, preventing such resources from entering landfills while supporting the establishment of a closed-loop critical mineral manufacturing supply chain in the U.S.

The EPA is overseeing the complex logistics of battery characterization, transportation and delivery to ABTC’s Nevada facility. ABTC says the damaged batteries vary in condition, from intact units to severely compromised materials requiring immediate processing to ensure safety compliance. At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.

That’s what Devi Glick, an energy analyst with Synapse Energy Economics, told the commission in written testimony filed late last week.

Kentucky Power originally told the PSC that investing in Mitchell was the most cost-effective option for its customers. However, it told the commission last month that the plant would require extensive repair or replacement of one of its two concrete cooling towers.

Glick testified that converting the plant from coal to natural gas would be less expensive than fixing the cooling tower and would avoid other potential environmental costs.

Kentucky Power co-owns Mitchell, in Marshall County, West Virginia, with Wheeling Power. Both are subsidiaries of American Electric Power.

In 2021, the Kentucky commission rejected Kentucky Power’s bid to keep its half of Mitchell past 2028. The West Virginia Public Service Commission then allowed Wheeling Power to pay for the entire project and recover the cost from its electricity customers.

Kentucky Power came back to the Kentucky PSC earlier this year seeking approval again, this time with the support of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.

Coleman’s predecessor, Daniel Cameron, recommended in 2021 that the plant be retired. Cameron is a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in 2026.

In her written testimony, Glick faulted Kentucky Power for comparing the cost of repairing Mitchell’s cooling tower with building new gas generation but not with converting the existing plant to gas.

Glick’s earlier calculations revealed the excess costs of two coal plants, one in Ohio and the other in Indiana, for Appalachian Power and Louisville Gas & Electric, and Kentucky Utilities electricity customers.

As reported by the Appalachia-Midsouth Newsroom, Appalachian Power customers paid $328 million more than necessary for electricity from the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation from 2018 to 2024.

LG&E and KU customers paid nearly $168 million more than necessary for OVEC power in those seven years.

According to a news release, Citizens Action Coalition has urged the IURC to reject the request filed by Indiana Michigan Power to build and purchase power plants for new Amazon and Google AI data centers at undisclosed locations.

Indiana Michigan Power has filed an Expedited Generation Resource plan in a move that the CAC has said could become “the most expensive proposed expansion of generation by a utility in a docketed proceeding in Indiana history.”

The CAC estimates that a minimum of 39% of EGR Plan costs will be passed on to utility customers within the next five years. The organization also expressed concern with the power company’s request for IURC to permit the introduction of a new bill tracker to the monthly electric bills.

The EGR Plan proposal does not provide enough information about the rate and likely impacts on a monthly basis, according to the CAC. Indiana Michigan Power also requested preapproval for the expansion of natural gas power plants, which CAC said would cover approximately 85% of the electricity as part of the EGR plan.

Multiple AI data centers have already been announced or are in the process of being planned throughout the Hoosier state.

Google is currently constructing a data center on 390 acres of land in Morgan County. Meanwhile, data centers have been proposed in both Hendricks and Henry counties. The largest of these proposed data centers is the Amazon data center campus coming to New Castle.

Now, Cornell researchers have used advanced data analytics – and, naturally, some AI, too – to create a state-by-state look at that environmental impact.

Sustainability information, like energy, water, climate, tend to be open and public.
The researchers also wanted to provide data-driven guidance for sustainable growth of AI infrastructure.","As the everyday use of AI has exploded in recent years, so have the energy demands of the computing infrastructure that supports it. But the environmental toll of these large data centers, which suck up gigawatts of power and require vast amounts of water for cooling, has been too diffuse and difficult to quantify.

Now, Cornell researchers have used advanced data analytics – and, naturally, some AI, too – to create a state-by-state look at that environmental impact. The team found that, by 2030, the current rate of AI growth would annually put 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the emissions equivalent of adding 5 to 10 million cars to U.S. roadways. It would also drain 731 to 1,125 million cubic meters of water per year – equal to the annual household water usage of 6 to 10 million Americans. The cumulative effect would put the AI industry’s net-zero emissions targets out of reach.

On the upside, the study also outlines an actionable roadmap that would use smart siting, faster grid decarbonization and operational efficiency to cut these impacts by approximately 73% (carbon dioxide) and 86% (water) compared with worst-case scenarios.

The findings were published Nov. 10 in Nature Sustainability. The first author is doctoral student Tianqi Xiao in the Process-Energy-Environmental Systems Engineering (PEESE) lab.

“Artificial intelligence is changing every sector of society, but its rapid growth comes with a real footprint in energy, water and carbon,” said Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering in Cornell Engineering, who led the project. “Our study is built to answer a simple question: Given the magnitude of the AI computing boom, what environmental trajectory will it take? And more importantly, what choices steer it toward sustainability?”

In order to quantify the environmental footprints of the nation’s AI computing infrastructure, the team began three years ago to compile “multiple dimensions” of financial, marketing and manufacturing data to understand how the industry is expanding, combined with location-specific data on power systems and resource consumption, and how they connect with changes in climate.

“There’s a lot of data, and that’s a huge effort. Sustainability information, like energy, water, climate, tend to be open and public. But industrial data is hard, because not every company is reporting everything,” You said. “And of course, eventually, we still need to be looking at multiple scenarios. There’s no way that one size fits all. Every region is different for regulations. We used AI to fill some of the data gap as well.”

But projecting the impacts wasn’t enough. The researchers also wanted to provide data-driven guidance for sustainable growth of AI infrastructure.

“There isn’t a silver bullet,” You said. “Siting, grid decarbonization and efficient operations work together – that’s how you get reductions on the order of roughly 73% for carbon and 86% for water.”

By far, one of the most important factors: location, location, location.

Many current data clusters are being constructed in water-scarce regions, such as Nevada and Arizona. And in some hubs, for example northern Virginia, rapid clustering can strain local infrastructure and water resources. Locating facilities in regions with lower water-stress and improving cooling efficiency could slash water demands by about 52%, and when combined with grid and operational best practices, total water reductions could reach 86%, the study found. The Midwest and “windbelt” states – particularly Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota – would deliver the best combined carbon-and-water profile.

“New York state remains a low-carbon, climate-friendly option thanks to its clean electricity mix of nuclear, hydropower and growing renewables,” You said, “although prioritizing water-efficient cooling and additional clean power is key.”

If decarbonization does not catch up with the computing demand, emissions could rise roughly 20%.

“Even if each kilowatt-hour gets cleaner, total emissions can rise if AI demand grows faster than the grid decarbonizes,” You said. “The solution is to accelerate the clean-energy transition in the same places where AI computing is expanding.”

However, decarbonizing the grid can only do so much. Even in the ambitious high-renewables scenario, by 2030 carbon dioxide would drop roughly 15% compared to the baseline, and approximately 11 million tons of residual emissions would remain, requiring roughly 28 gigawatts of wind or 43 gigawatts of solar capacity to reach net-zero.

The researchers determined that deploying an array of energy- and water-efficient technologies, such as advanced liquid cooling and improved server utilization, could potentially remove another 7% of carbon dioxide and lower water use by 29%, for a total water reduction of 32% when combined.

As companies such as OpenAI and Google funnel more and more money into rapidly building AI data centers to keep up with demand, this is a pivotal moment for coordinated planning between industry, utilities and regulators to avoid local water scarcity and higher grid emissions, according to You.

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, has been in force for just over five years. That means a deadline of sorts is coming up. As passed by Congress in 2019, the USMCA includes a clause directing the three partner countries to “review” the agreement after six years — that is, by July 2026 — and decide whether they like it more or less as is, or want to see changes.

In principle, that’s fine. The agreement is a big human creation, with some notable innovations. As such, it has lots of features that look good to some groups but bad to others. With the “review” ahead, industry associations, pressure groups, labor unions, and agricultural commodity groups are all dutifully writing up lists of ways to improve it. But fundamentally, the agreement is working reasonably well — facilitating trade in agriculture, energy, and manufacturing, helping digital channels stay open, encouraging joint work on wildlife trafficking and ocean health, and experimenting with a novel approach to labor issues. At the same time, though, the Trump administration’s profligate tariffs and threats against Canada and Mexico are causing a series of genuine crises: usurpation of Congress’s Constitutional authority; erosion of relationships at the core of U.S. national security; and a deteriorating economic environment as tariffs raise costs for families and diminish the competitiveness of U.S. farming and manufacturing.

The “deadline,” meanwhile, is a very soft one. In fact, it requires no action at all. And in the circumstances of 2025 and 2026, the best choice is “let well enough alone.” Congress should make it clear that the USMCA does not need major changes at this point, and that policy should instead focus on ending these self-created crises. If the administration nonetheless wants to proceed, Congress should require three steps first:

Approve legislation such as Representative Linda Sanchez’s HR 2888, which would terminate the administration’s “emergency” and “national security” decrees under laws like “IEEPA,” “Section 232,” and “Section 301” and require votes on any future Presidential imposition of tariffs (or other import limits) with some carefully circumscribed exceptions.

Stabilize North American security by restoring trust, mutual respect, and common interest as the foundation of U.S. policy for America’s neighbors.

Restore Constitutionally appropriate policymaking, with Congress setting negotiating objectives for trade policy agencies and voting to approve, or not, any agreements making changes in U.S. tariff rates or trade laws.

With these done, it would be appropriate, and might be useful, to look closely at the USMCA and see whether a broad consensus exists for changes that would improve it. But not before.",https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photos-PPI-9.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:13.079133

If you’re ready to get rid of the jack-o’-lanterns sitting on your porch, don’t toss them in your trash can.

Every year, approximately 1 billion pounds of pumpkins end up in landfills across the country, where they release climate-warming methane that hurts the environment.

Hamilton County’s waste reduction agency is trying to combat that spooky statistic. It’s encouraging residents to give their pumpkins a sustainable second life through cooking, donating and composting them.

“Pumpkins are such an easy thing to prevent from going into the landfill because there are so many other outlets for them,” said Sam Goubeaux, program coordinator at Hamilton County ReSource.

Donate them to a farm

Some local farms are accepting pumpkins for animal feed. Bahr Farm, 969 W. North Bend Rd., is collecting unpainted pumpkins for its cows to enjoy. You can drop them off in the bin by the picnic table until Dec. 6.

Bahr Farm also has a composting operation on site.

“If your pumpkin is a little moldy, or if you're not really sure if it's appropriate for animal feed, they'll still take it, and they'll decide which ones they're able to feed to the cows and which ones that they're going to compost,” Goubeaux said.

Perch Farm, 900 Hopewell Rd., and Tewes Farm, 2801 Crescent Springs Pike, are also both taking natural pumpkin donations.

Turn your Halloween decoration into a tasty treat

If your pumpkin is still firm, you can turn your Halloween decoration into food. Goubeaux says there are endless recipes that call for pumpkin or pumpkin puree.

“Just cut the pumpkin in half, take out the insides, roast that exterior in your oven at a fairly low temperature for a few hours, and then you can puree it and use that puree in recipes,” Goubeaux said.

She suggests pumpkin pie or pumpkin cookies.

Opt to compost

Pumpkins are rich in nutrients and can make great additions to compost and soil.

Goubeaux recommends breaking up or smashing your pumpkins before adding them to a compost pile.

“Ultimately, that will help [with] decomposition,” Goubeaux said. “It'll help make everything go by a little faster, so that you're not looking at that pumpkin for quite as long.”

Then, cover the pumpkin with plenty of leaves or brown, carbon-rich material to ensure you have the right balance in your compost pile.

If you don’t have compost, a community garden or other organization may take your pumpkins. Lierer’s Market, 4170 Hamilton Ave., is collecting natural, unpainted pumpkins for composting. Use code 1031 to open the free drop-off bin outside the store.

Leave them outside for animals

If you leave your pumpkins outside, animals from racoons to deer will come feed on them. Goubeaux suggests breaking up your pumpkin and leaving it in your backyard.

“It'll attract some of those animals...by having that that fleshy interior out,” Goubeaux said.

Pumpkins without any paint or glitter on them are safer for wildlife.

Plug Power’s announcement that it is suspending work on its Department of Energy–backed green hydrogen projects marks a sobering turning point. Most companies would fight to secure a $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the federal government. Plug Power is walking away from it. That decision, combined with yet another round of cost cutting, is not a show of discipline. It is an act of triage.

The company’s new liquidity plan is described as generating $275 million through monetizing electricity rights, releasing restricted cash, and cutting maintenance costs. In practice that means selling off parts of its future in order to pay for the present. The decision to walk away from DOE-backed projects reduces the long-term strategic leverage Plug once had and underscores how much pressure its balance sheet is under. Each quarter it burns through tens of millions in cash. There are only so many assets left to monetize before the core of the company is compromised.

Monetizing electricity rights sounds like a clever financial instrument but it is closer to a short-term sale. Plug likely holds grid connection contracts and power purchase agreements in New York and other regions that could be valuable to data center developers. Selling those rights or assigning them is a one-time gain that reduces future flexibility. It is the corporate equivalent of pawning your tools to make payroll. The money may arrive faster, but the ability to generate sustained earnings disappears with it.

The same dynamic applies to maintenance cuts. Plug Power has been through multiple rounds of cost reduction. Project Quantum Leap in early 2025 targeted up to $200 million in savings through workforce reductions, facility consolidation, and lower service costs. The most recent announcement adds more “reduced maintenance expenses” to the mix. There are only so many ways to cut maintenance before it begins to affect plant reliability, regulatory compliance, and safety, and they’ve been cutting since the beginning of the year. The company is now within striking distance of those limits, and quite likely heading past them.

Plug’s hydrogen production facilities in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana represent the heart of its operation. Together they can produce about 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen a day, although in practice they produce less on average due to standard maintenance and operational cycles. These are high-pressure, high-temperature industrial environments that depend on strict maintenance schedules for compressors, cryogenic systems, and leak detection. When preventive maintenance intervals are stretched, small problems can turn into failures. A leaking valve or a worn compressor seal does not just stop production. It can create an explosive or asphyxiation hazard for workers. Hydrogen ignites at low energy, spreads quickly, and is invisible when burning. Worker health and safety are the potential casualties when budgets are tightened too far.

Hydrogen leakage is not only a workplace issue. It is a climate issue. Recent atmospheric chemistry research has clarified that hydrogen has a global warming potential of roughly 33 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. When hydrogen escapes into the air it slows the breakdown of methane and increases short-term warming. The same undetected leaks that endanger workers quietly increase the company’s greenhouse footprint. Each kilogram of leaked hydrogen equates to about 33 kilograms of CO2e. Even a 1% leak rate from a 40-ton-per-day system would create nearly 5,000 tons of CO2e per year. While this rules out a major hydrogen distribution system, it doesn’t preclude well-designed and operated industrial facilities. If Plug’s maintenance savings come from reduced leak monitoring or delayed seal replacements, the environmental risks will increase increase in lockstep with the safety risks.

This is not the first time Plug Power has been on the edge. Previous financial analyses I’ve done highlighted its reliance on continuous capital raises and stock dilution to cover ongoing losses. It hasn’t turned a profit once in its nearly 30 years of existence, and annual losses have been increasing, not decreasing. The company has struggled to turn technology demonstrations into stable cash flow. Hydrogen production and liquefaction are capital intensive. Margins on fuel cells and electrolyzers remain low. Service costs are high. Plug’s repeated claims of coming profitability have always been contingent on scale that never materialized. The DOE loan guarantee was supposed to provide the runway to achieve it. Walking away from that support reveals that internal forecasts have changed for the worse.

Plug Power’s offtake strategy was built around transportation and materials handling rather than industrial hydrogen demand. Its biggest customers are Walmart, Amazon, The Home Depot, and Uline, all using hydrogen to power fleets of fuel-cell forklifts and warehouse equipment. While there are a few tens of thousands of fuel-cell forklifts, millions of battery electric forklifts are sold annually. The story for materials handling is the same as every transportation segment: hydrogen can’t compete with batteries. The company signed a supply agreement with Universal Hydrogen—now defunct of course—to provide green hydrogen for aviation applications, where the competitive headwinds are different but the result is the same: no hydrogen. These relationships looked impressive when fuel-cell mobility was being promoted as the next revolution, but they tied Plug’s fortunes to a sector that was never going to achieve scale or stable margins.

A maintenance-related failure at one of Plug Power’s hydrogen plants would have immediate and severe financial consequences. The company’s three operating sites together produce roughly 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen per day, meaning that the loss of even one facility could eliminate a quarter to a third of total output. At an estimated internal cost of $6 to $8 per kilogram and limited ability to substitute supply from other plants, an extended outage could erase tens of millions in quarterly revenue while fixed costs continue to accrue. Emergency repairs would drive unplanned capex, insurance premiums would rise, and delivery contracts could trigger penalties or cancellations from large clients such as Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot. For a firm already operating on thin liquidity, months of lost production would accelerate cash depletion and likely force new equity or debt issuance under distressed conditions. In effect, one preventable failure could move Plug Power from restructuring risk to insolvency risk almost overnight.

Industrial offtakers such as fertilizer, methanol, or steel producers buy hydrogen in far larger volumes under long-term contracts and integrate it into core processes. Plug chose to serve high-profile logistics and mobility clients instead, where consumption is small, infrastructure costs are high, price sensitivity is acute and the battery-powered alternatives are cheaper and more reliable. The result is a portfolio of customers who cannot absorb enough hydrogen to support large production plants and who treat supply as a commodity rather than a partnership. Plug Power bet on hydrogen as a transportation fuel instead of an industrial feedstock, and that decision now defines its collapse.

I’ve updated my data set of hydrogen for transportation plays as a couple of new entrants came to my attention. One, Bramble Energy, did so in the traditional way by having its bankruptcy announced. Many of the firms on this list flew under the radar until they plowed straight into a hillside. Another, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, posted a breathless paean to its growth plans in Asian commercial vehicles and data centers on LinkedIn, then the CEO spent a lot of time proving that they’d never taken a public relations course in their life in responses to comments about why that’s going to be problematic. As I noted recently, heavy fuel cell vehicle sales are plummeting in China while battery electric vehicles skyrocket. China has run the market test, and just as with every other trial of hydrogen vs batteries, batteries have won handily.

As for data centers, they are an AI-inflated bubble right now, and hydrogen, while frothy, isn’t remotely a good solution for what power is required at them. Electricity is their first or second highest operational expense, competing with equipment depreciation, with public statements by analysis organizations ranging from 20% to 60% of annual expenses. Hydrogen fuel cell-generated electricity will be the most expensive option in the list, with even gray hydrogen turning into electricity that costs over $600 per MWh. Data centers were averaging $100–$180 per MWh in 2024, so aren’t going to be interested in multiplying their electricity expense by a factor of three or more.

I’ve added Bramble to my table as Defunct and Horizon as high risk as a result. I’m sure that there are more missing, just as I’m sure that many of the ones that haven’t announced failure or pivoting have quietly done one or the other.

Plug now sits squarely in the “Desperation” phase of hydrogen for transportation firms’ life cycle. The life cycle has become predictable enough to resemble a case study in technological and financial sociology. It starts with the hype phase, when visionary founders and early investors make grand claims about decarbonizing trucks, ships, or aircraft with zero-emission hydrogen. They release glossy investor decks filled with hockey-stick demand projections and “addressable market” charts showing trillions in future opportunity. These firms are buoyed by government enthusiasm and a media narrative hungry for the next Tesla, leading to inflated valuations long before a single refueling station or kilogram of hydrogen is sold at a profit.

The second phase is scale signaling. Firms begin announcing gigawatt-scale electrolyzer projects, transcontinental refueling corridors, and partnerships with brand-name logistics or automotive companies. They often describe these as “strategic collaborations” rather than binding contracts. Most of the deals are memorandums of understanding or pilot programs. Capital expenditure estimates are heroic, but the underlying unit economics are fragile. Production costs remain multiple times higher than the market can bear, and every plan assumes rapid declines in hydrogen prices that never materialize.

Then comes the financial engineering phase, when reality begins to intrude. Cash burn accelerates as projects move from press release to prototype. The company raises more capital through equity dilution, government grants, and creative accounting maneuvers like “monetizing electricity rights” or asset leasing. Executives start talking about “margin expansion” and “vertical integration,” code words for moving costs around to buy time. Stock offerings are framed as growth financing rather than survival funding.

By the desperation phase, liquidity warnings appear in quarterly filings, projects are delayed, and “operational discipline” becomes the new corporate mantra. Plants that were supposed to deliver green hydrogen at $2 per kilogram still cost $8. Maintenance budgets are cut, staff are laid off, and asset sales are rebranded as optimization. Safety incidents, production interruptions, and missed delivery contracts begin to surface. Public relations efforts shift from transformation to endurance.

The final phase is collapse or absorption. A few assets are sold to larger industrial firms that value the hardware or grid connections more than the business. Shareholders are wiped out, early believers exit quietly, and the technology itself continues on in diminished form. What started as a climate solution ends as a balance-sheet salvage operation. The core problem was never lack of engineering talent. It was the decision to build an entire company around hydrogen as a transportation fuel, a role the molecule was never suited for. The physics were wrong, the economics were worse, and the hype cycle simply postponed the reckoning.

Plug is a veteran in the sector but not immune to the same structural economics. Its liquidity measures buy time but do not change the math. Even if it manages to create the $275 million in new liquidity, Plug’s monthly burn rate and debt obligations suggest less than a year of operating runway.

The risk trajectory is clear. Financial stress leads to deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance leads to higher safety risk. Higher safety risk leads to hydrogen leaks and downtime. Those leaks erode the climate justification for green hydrogen and damage the company’s credibility with investors and regulators. Plug’s management may see maintenance cuts as a temporary bridge, but the bridge is being built from the same materials that are supposed to hold up the plant.

There is also a moral dimension. Every technician working at a Plug site depends on those safety systems being tested, calibrated, and maintained. Each time the company reduces maintenance spending it is transferring risk from the balance sheet to the workforce and the surrounding community. That is not an accounting entry. It is a gamble with real consequences.

Plug Power’s financial collapse is more a matter of timing than anything else. When a firm is forced to sell critical assets, suspend government-backed projects, and reduce maintenance on facilities handling thousands of kilograms of hydrogen every day, the endgame is already in sight. Hydrogen still has core applications in industry as a feedstock, but transportation was never a viable path to profit. Plug’s trajectory is a warning to investors and policymakers that enthusiasm does not replace economics.

When a company is down to selling its grid connections and stretching the maintenance that keeps its plants safe, it is no longer in the innovation business. It is in survival mode. The question is not whether the cuts will expose vulnerabilities, but when. Worker safety, climate integrity, and financial solvency are now bound together by the same neglected valves and corroded fittings. If those give way, it will not just be hydrogen escaping. It will be whatever remains of trust in the promise that this industry was supposed to deliver. My only hope is that no workers will be injured in Plug Power’s end game.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-10-2025-10_23_44-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-10 18:01:07.303582

But a new front has opened, pitting these copper thieves against EV owners who are already trying to find the fastest chargers on the road. A rash of copper thefts targeting the valuable-for-scrap cables on EV chargers is leaving more and more EV owners wondering what to do when there's no way to connect their electric vehicles (EVs) to the charging network because the cables have been stolen.

Fortunately, a variety of solutions are being implemented by charging system providers, in the hope that the high rate of theft of EV charging cables can be brought under control. One of these providers is ChargePoint, which is combining 'cut-resistant' charging cables with alarm systems to reduce the rate of charger cable thefts. The cable-covering material is reinforced with steel, which resists the usual tools used to cut these cables, including bolt cutters, wire cutters, and battery-powered tools. These changes make it much more difficult and time-consuming for the thief to cut through a cable. ChargePoint also plans to license the use of these reinforced cables to other charging providers.

ChargePoint has also developed security software called ""ChargePoint Protect"" that can detect cable tampering or cutting in real time. The software, sent out as an over-the-air update and compatible with most of the company's charging stations, sets off alarms intended to scare thieves away while also notifying the owners of those charging stations about potential thefts in progress.

How are other EV charger companies getting creative?

Brooklyn-based charging provider It's Electric has eliminated the problem at its source by creating the first UL-certified detachable charging cable, the Brooklyn-718. Users of It's Electric's charging stations simply unlock the cables from a secure compartment near the charger and return the cables to the same locked storage area when they have finished. This innovation removes the cables from view while also making them much less attractive to thieves, who must first break into a storage compartment to access them — a big deal if you're in one of the states with the fewest public EV chargers.

In the UK, charging provider InstaVolt has collaborated with Formula Space, an EV design specialist, to introduce its new CableGuard system. CableGuard combines an outer sheath that is much more difficult to cut through with a 'forensic liquid' that is visible under UV light. This liquid not only identifies the copper cables as stolen but also the location from which they were stolen, in a database accessible to police. This feature will aid greatly in quickly prosecuting the offenders.

InstaVolt has also added security measures, including AI-powered CCTV that will identify nefarious activity as it happens. This starts with continuous, around-the-clock monitoring and ends with ex-military operatives patrolling charging sites and authorized to detain individuals acting suspiciously, leading to arrests and prosecutions. In addition, geo-tracking technology is used to alert security personnel when cables leave a charging site, enabling them to respond quickly.

The vast majority-71.74%-traveled by car last year. While owning and driving cars will continue to be a fundamental mode of transport for the foreseeable future, Thanksgiving traffic might look much more sustainable in the not-too-distant future, CANOPY reports.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.
“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.
For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels.
“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.","Brookfield Renewable Partners sees a clear turn toward firm power as data centers, re-industrialization and broad electrification tighten supply in key markets.

On its third-quarter earnings call last week, the company highlighted hydro contracts with major technology buyers and a U.S. government partnership that could put Westinghouse at the center of a large nuclear build.

Chief Executive Officer Connor Teskey said demand is broad and rising.

“We continue to see accelerating demand for power across nearly all the markets in which we operate,” he said, pointing to three themes: electrification, reindustrialization and the “extraordinary demand for energy from hyperscalers.”

That demand profile is changing the resource mix.

“It is becoming increasingly apparent that meeting the surging demand for electricity will require an any-and-all solution, leveraging solar, wind, hydro, gas, nuclear and other technologies to ensure sufficient load and consistent delivery of electrons,” said Teskey.

The immediate shift is in baseload contracting. Brookfield is now re-contracting a meaningful slice of its U.S. hydro fleet to digital buyers. Teskey said the company has approximately 5 terawatt hours (TWh) of generation coming up for recontracting and is finding that hyperscalers are willing to sign long tenor agreements for dependable capacity.

“We also signed a new 20-year contract with Microsoft at another one of our hydro assets in PJM as part of our renewable energy framework with that counterparty,” he said. Earlier this year, Brookfield executed a hydro framework with Google and quickly followed with two facility-level deals.

Those PPAs are funding real work at the plants and in the balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.

“We executed upfinancings at our Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydro assets recently, following the first contracts under our framework agreement with Google that we signed earlier in the year,” he said. “And we completed an innovative upfinancing at our Smoky Mountain Hydro asset.”

Taylor said the deals were “over 5x oversubscribed at the tightest spreads we have seen for these types of financings in the past 5 years.”

These long-dated baseload PPAs are enabling uprates and modernization packages at legacy hydro stations. That typically includes turbine and runner refurbishment, generator rewinds, excitation and relay upgrades, digital governors and controls, dam safety improvements and cybersecurity hardening. Brookfield did not list specific scope items on the call, but the company made clear that hydro pricing uplift plus up-financings are creating headroom to invest.

Batteries also featured in the quarter, both on cost trend and delivered projects. Teskey said storage costs are improving quickly.

“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.

Brookfield said it commissioned a large system in Australia that signals the scale of future tenders.

“We advanced our global battery development strategy, highlighted by the delivery of a 340-megawatt battery in Australia, which combined with the first phase of this project is now the largest operating battery solution in the country,” Teskey said.

For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels. It also suggests steady work for balance-of-plant contractors and suppliers, including switchyard upgrades, transformers, grid-forming inverters and controls, HVAC and fire systems for battery enclosures and multi-year service agreements to match the tenor of capacity sales.

Brookfield’s nuclear interest is expanding as well. Through its ownership stake in Westinghouse, the company expects to participate across design, engineering and long-term services. Co-President and General Counsel Jennifer Mazin described a new government partnership.

“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.

The agreement supports the government’s goal of having 10 large-scale reactors with completed designs under construction by 2030 and includes government support for arranging financing, facilitating permits and the approvals required.

Westinghouse’s near-term role remains focused on the front end of the build and then long-term support.

Mazin said the company will provide “design, engineering and procurement services for these new build reactors,” and after commissioning, “we would expect to provide fuel and maintenance services for the lives of these new nuclear facilities, which is on average between 60 and 80 years each.”

She said the partnership should also catalyze the broader supply chain, adding that “orders of this magnitude should provide both a catalyst and enhanced certainty to the sector that should enable investment in the supply chain for Westinghouse and the nuclear industry more broadly.”

Brookfield has also signed a letter of intent to evaluate completing two AP1000 units at the VC Summer site in South Carolina. Teskey said the diligence window is short and interest from partners and offtakers is real.

“We are encouraged by our initial feedback from potential partners and hyperscaler offtakers,” he said, adding that protections could include sharing cost overrun burdens with offtakers and suppliers and arranging financing “that provides incremental liquidity in the event of cost overruns.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:25.892187

The lawsuit, which names the White House budget director, Russell T. Vought, as a main defendant, claims that the Trump administration took advantage of the lapse in government funding in October to slash energy programs in states where voters have supported Democrats.

The lawsuit came as a group of Democrats in the Senate broke rank on Sunday to support a funding measure that, if adopted by the Senate and House, would end the shutdown after more than 40 days of deep financial pain and sputtering government services.

According to the lawsuit, immediately as the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the White House kicked into high gear to halt billions destined for Democratic-led states, in an apparent attempt to gain leverage as lawmakers settled into a prolonged fight over funding. It argues the decision amounted to “intentional discrimination” and “bare animus,” inflicting deliberate hardship on states that voted against Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.

In a social media post on Oct. 1, Mr. Vought announced the government would terminate close to $8 billion for climate-related projects in 16 states, all represented by senators who caucus with the Democratic Party.

The original blog is included below this update.

A few weeks ago, I tackled EV policy, the United Nations' “green shipping plan” and the fight over rare earth minerals and, more broadly, the poor policy decisions that fire up flywheels without any idea of where the train is headed.

The last two editions of the Wall Street Journal brought this timely topic to the top of the list.

The point of the blog was less about power sources and more about the government’s attempt to pick a replacement technology with what one might call “light-bulb-off” decision-making. First, the government miscalculated the market’s “true” demand and the depth of the greenie’s commitment once they had to use their own wallet.

Second was the absence of the evaluation of the challenges in manufacturing and supply, which distracted every corner of America while redirecting otherwise time, materials and energy to what will be recognized as the “scrap heap” of 2025.

The notion of holistic, cradle-to-grave type thinking apparently was stuck in park.

We’ll all be paying for that now… But as stated 3 weeks ago, there are lessons to be taught from foolishness.

Scrapping Plans Underway at Ford

In her October 7, 2025 WSJ article, “Ford Considers Scrapping Electric Version of F-150 Truck,” Sharon Terlep reported that production of the money-losing F-150 EV pickup – once hyped as significant of its earlier “Model T” — may be shut down for good.

Low demand for electric trucks at hefty price tags and 1-ton batteries — as well as a $13 billion loss for Ford – is expected to bring the U.S.’ first major EV casualty. In October, the first month since the end of the EV tax credit, Ford’s U.S. EV sales in the U.S. fell 24% year over year.

And guess what? The failing EV Ford F-Series — at risk of shutdown — is actually the top-selling large EV this year — ahead of #2 by 41%.

Jenkins: ‘Dissect the Dishonesty’

A WSJ op-ed from Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., appeared the following day on “Ford’s Electric Pickup is an EV Casualty.” While it was President Trump and the GOP Congress who removed the fines that ended the incentives, Jenkins adds that the Democrats will be in charge again. “Maybe the useful thing now,” he writes, “is to dissect the collective dishonesty of the climate crowd.

Jenkins says, tongue-in-cheek, that the government’s policy may have started with a directive to find a way to “produce electric vehicles that are worse for the climate than if no EVs were produced.”

Two types of people supported and authorized the policy, he writes. First was the “Obama figures, who wanted EVs to wave in front of greens but also to preserve the profit model of the Big Three.”

The other camp, he says, was the army of climate groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Princeton-related Repeat Group and others — and the New York Times. “All proved willing to say whatever words were necessary to convey falsely that U.S. EV policy made sense,” Jenkins writes.

He makes the point that if policy incentives were “genuinely aimed at replacing gasoline-driven miles to produce a net reduction in greenhouse emissions,” the output would not have been the “big showpieces like the Ford F-150 Lightning, the Hummer EV or the new and fabulously absurd $400,000 Cadillac Celestiq.”

He adds that “Building these cars’ batteries and keeping them charged is guaranteed to produce more emissions than they can displace in their lifetimes … These cars are net insults to the climate and lose billions — the very definition of policy perversity.”

Other Automakers in Trouble, Too

WSJ also reported the plans by Stellantis and GM to discontinue electric truck production, as well as tanking Tesla Cybertruck sales and how EV truck-maker Rivian is slashing jobs to conserve cash.

GM has lost billions on electric trucks after rolling out a string of them in recent years. It sold just 1,800 of its 3 electric pickup models in October. The automaker set aside $1.6 billion in the third quarter to account for losses, with more to be added to the pile.

Last month, GM said it was idling the Detroit factory that makes its EV Silverado truck, and also stopped making its EV cargo van.

Meanwhile, Honda booked the equivalent of $1.49 billion in one-time electric vehicle-related expenses for losses and impairment on EVs sold in the U.S. and wrote down EV development assets. This comes after the May announcement that it would cut its EV investment by $20 billion in the coming years.

We’ll Leave the Light on For You

No one revels in seeing a cash-kindled EV fire burn, but ponder the horrendous waste that has already happened and will occur for years.

Workers – At Ford alone, an estimated 730 workers were laid off by the F-150 Lightning stoppage. Terlep estimates the number of workers already put on the unemployment lines is in the thousands.

Suppliers – Our industry competes with the automakers for raw materials, components and supplies, and the waste to date is beyond comprehension. The fact that so much of these materials couldn’t be sourced domestically only added to the burning embers of the trade war because of a belief that America can only win if its automakers do, too.

Automakers – Coming to the auto companies last since they aren’t smart enough to consider how misled government regulations and propped-up incentives could be corrected by another administration. Ford alone tooled itself up with a capacity to build 150,000 Lightnings a year.

A few more observations:

When is the last time that a lack of a plan, or even a “concept of a plan,” has worked out — after the fact — when the government is calling the shots?

Just because the potential exists for advanced technology doesn’t justify subsidies or propped-up sales support. And a rush to choose one technology over another – and the wrong one at that – will delay real progress for years.

Emotional, bandwagon-jumping fanfare brought false hope and, in some cases, fear. The U.S. public was sold a bill of goods, and the bill will be paid in one form or another.

Regulations, subsidies and incentives … This is what happens when the government gets into the business of business.

The ‘Greening Up’ Numb-Skullery

Published October 21, 2025

The creation of an environmental agenda P&L — that recognizes the big picture rather than obsessions on any one piece — can keep foolhardy notions grounded where they belong

It was 31 years ago that I wrote my first business-to-business media op-ed piece. Over the years, I’ve advised our developing columnists and bloggers to always keep a few opinion-piece ideas on hand, even if half-baked. Because sometimes you gotta throw one away and start over.

Some of you, seated to my left, might say this one deserves the circular file. But hey, it comes with the territory …

Seriously, my advice to up-and-coming bloggers? Start a “stupid stuff” file folder and fill it when you see something that affects your audience’s livelihood.

My file folder, by the way, is overflowing these days…

Foolishness is a Great Teacher

In addition to the spectator sport of column-writing, reporting on foolishness does serve a purpose if we can merely learn from it. And since numb-skullery knows no bounds, a flag thrown on one poor decision can keep another from being made elsewhere.

In the Oct. 19, Wall Street Journal, I read about the U.N.’s “green shipping plan” (“Trump Backlash Delays Green Shipping Plan,” by Ed Ballard and Costas Paris) to decarbonize the ocean shipping trade. The WSJ reports that the proposal, supported by some 60 nations and intended to take effect in 2027, would require ship-owners to use lower-carbon alternatives to conventional shipping fuel or pay a fee that ratches up over time.

Lower-carbon fuels are more expensive. Shipping-services provider Clarksons noted that the plan for higher-cost “could cost the shipping industry more than $3 trillion to switch to new forms of green power.”

Thankfully, President Donald Trump quickly sank its prospects to the bottom of the ocean. Shipping accounts for 3% of global carbon emissions, but we also don’t need a cure that’s worse than the disease.

Closer to home, we have entire industries just hanging on while food prices skyrocket. Who in their right mind is asking for another propped-up “initiative” that further erodes farmers’ and manufacturers' razor-thin margins in the name of greening things up?

Few winners in endeavors like these, but plenty of losers.

How many times will we let the train leave the station without any idea where it’s going?

Rare Earths, Even Rarer Thinking

The dearth of rare earths – as well as other metals – is also story making headlines nearly daily. Rare earths are in demand for virtually every advanced technology today, including electronics, energy and defense.

Not only are rare earths controlled by China, but less-than-stellar domestic policies caused their already short supply to be compounded. As China chokes off our ability to source rare earths, our trade officers are consumed in negotiations to protect a segment not yet ready for prime time anyway.

Let’s talk EVs for a moment. President Joe Biden convinced Americans to artificially “prop up” the sales of EVs regardless of the automakers’ ability to actually manufacture the vehicles. According to Benchmark Source, the need for EV motors significantly increased rare earth demand. In 2024, rare earth demand grew 32% from the previous year. In 2025, this demand is expected to increase 16%.

We’d still have a severe rare-earth shortage, but we wouldn’t be scrapping for the minerals destined for automakers.

No, I’ve not been particularly supportive of the electric car obsession that our former president “chose” to create because it was “trendy” and without analysis, economic or otherwise.

Instead, one can argue that if and when the technology (and its infrastructure) is proven and John Q. Public believes in EVs of its own free will (and not because of a handout), those EV order books can be filled on their own.

Oh, and by the way, the Oct. 20 Wall Street Journal noted that General Motors admitted its own EV pullback would cost it $1.6 billion. Some maintain that “Old Joe” picked the wrong technology altogether for the next-generation powered vehicle.

If this were golf, nearly everyone would be shouting “Mulligan” at the same time.

An Environmental Agenda P&L

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, holistic is defined as “dealing with or treating the whole of something or someone and not just a part.” If we want to pursue things in the name of environmentalism, we need a holistic environmental P&L. That is, if carbon reductions are desired in say, autos, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to rev up the so-called “dirty power” elsewhere to create a grid that cannot be sustained. The ledger doesn’t balance.

I’ve seen it first-hand. You can attack one line item with such vigor that you can whittle it down to near nothing, but at an expense 10-fold on another line that results in little, if any, holistic impact on what was desired in the first place. Those byproducts like shock and surprise, egg on one’s face, frustrations and gnashing of teeth could have been altogether avoided.

On a lighter note, I have an analogy to make about those trains leaving the station without any plan or consideration.

Just over 20 years ago, my sisters and I pitched in and bought our dad, Frank, a season-long lawn care service after his riding mower went to its final resting place at the scrap yard.

Just a few months into it, Dad was complaining about the per-cut expense and the agronomic intellect of his “custom cutters.” So he bought his first-ever ZTR from a local equipment dealer. Not only did he purchase a contractor-grade model (a Gravely from Wisconsin’s Dan Ariens) that he’ll never put enough hours on in his suburban lot, but he also went “big” with the width of his mower deck.

Limited by his two-car garage, the footprint of the mower required a green-lighting of a new-shed construction to house his new ZTR. Then, apparently to give him more time on his new ZTR during the dry Wisconsin summers, he had an irrigation system installed. The purchases that summer easily exceed $30,000 in today’s dollars.

Perhaps to protect himself from the watchful eye my late mother (and chief financial officer), we don’t believe his accounting factors in the permits, concrete-pouring, shingling, painting and upkeep of the shed, nor the steadily increasing implement purchases, the water bills or the mobile-service to keep his trusty ZTR in tip-top shape.

“Yeah, it turned out to be an expensive mower purchase, I guess,” he says, smiling about his “investments.” And then almost always adds, “It was just going to be money I might someday give the kids.”

Frank has earned the right to have some fun on his property and toss some dollars around. Those with oversight of our hard-earned tax contributions, well, not so much.

You get the picture. As author Lewis Caroll voiced through the Cheshire Cat, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”

It’s time to chart the course – and known and unknown variables – before starting up the locomotives. Are we ready to take inventory and learn?

Glenfarne has selected Baker Hughes as its supplier for main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Baker Hughes has also committed to a strategic investment to support Alaska LNG. The agreements were announced today in a ceremony in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

""American LNG is not just an energy source – it's a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation's future,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we're strengthening our nation's energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness. Together, through partnerships with industry leaders like Glenfarne and Baker Hughes, we're building the infrastructure and partnerships that ensure U.S. leadership in reliable, responsible, and affordable energy for decades to come – starting in Alaska.""

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. ""Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio totals 32.8 MTPA of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana. The companies previously announced that Baker Hughes will supply compression equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG project.

Inflation and higher energy costs were among the issues that helped Democrats notch larger-than-expected wins in last week’s off-year elections, particularly in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as in Georgia, where voters elected two Democrats to the state’s utility board, the first time any members of that party will serve on it in almost two decades.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger made clean power, including renewables and offshore wind, central to her goal of lowering energy prices for the state’s residents. Likewise, in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill pledged to declare a state of emergency over rising utility costs on her first day in office and freeze rate increases for residential customers. She said her administration will also “massively build out cheaper and cleaner power generation.”

Surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans favor increased use of renewable power, though earlier this year, Pew and Gallup found support for doing so had weakened considerably from past levels. Perhaps that’s because Donald Trump was elected on a promise of lowering costs for Americans, particularly energy prices, by setting aside environmental concerns to dramatically increase oil and gas production and even expand coal use. So far, that strategy has failed.

While gasoline prices are down slightly from a year ago, residential electricity rates have jumped about 10% this year, more than double the rate of overall inflation. The rapid increase in power demands from AI data centers has been a big factor in why electricity prices are rising. At the same time, the Trump administration’s elimination of federal incentives for clean power threatens to make it harder over the next few years for utilities to keep up with rapidly growing electricity demand, given that wind and solar systems, combined with battery storage, can be added faster.

And setting aside the climate benefits, clean power is now competitive with conventional natural gas, if not cheaper in many cases. “A gas-fired power plant, a simple cycle plant with a combustion turbine, is probably in the neighborhood of $2,000 a kilowatt to build,” Bob Frenzel, CEO of Minnesota-based utility Xcel Energy, told Forbes. “That's probably the same price as a wind farm, as a rule of thumb. … So you can see where if you're measuring sheer energy, wind can be competitive on a megawatt-hour basis.”

A year from now, when voters go to the polls to decide on who they want in Congress, politicians pushing cheap, clean power could have an edge.

The Big Read

Elon Musk’s $1 Trillion Pay Plan: The Case For Magical Thinking

The only thing more outlandish than Elon Musk’s demand for a $1 trillion pay package is the idea that Tesla’s shareholders would grant it. And yet that is how things played out, with everyone from massive investment funds to small, individual investors approving compensation so vast the new Pope decried it. It’s a bet that lightning will strike again for the most successful U.S. industrial entrepreneur of the 21st century — that Musk can overcome Tesla’s falling electric vehicle sales and his tarnished image by pivoting to AI-powered robotaxis and humanoid robots.

With its stock already trading near an all-time high, at over 300 times projected earnings, many investors appear to think that’s a foregone conclusion even before votes were tallied at today’s annual meeting. Over 75% of shareholders approved the package, Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, told attendees.

“Tesla's current valuation only makes sense if you attribute magic powers to Elon Musk,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “If you break out the new business lines he’s talking about, there’s no particular reason to believe that Tesla is the leading company for self-driving cars. Waymo's technology is clearly better. … The only evidence that Tesla is the leader in this technology is that Elon Musk says so.”

And that’s also the crux of the proxy. “Musk’s greatest skill is his ability to convince investors that he can do the miraculous,” said Mukunda.

Hot Topic

Dandelion Energy CEO Dan Yates on its leasing program for geothermal systems to cut home heating and cooling costs

What you’re doing is different from conventional and next-generation geothermal systems that generate energy. How does Dandelion’s tech work?

We are not generating electricity or power at all. We are using a bore in the backyard effectively to exchange heat with the earth. So we're sucking heat out of the earth using a heat pump inside the house. The result of that is an ultra-high efficiency furnace and air conditioner. The vast majority of building emissions are from heating and cooling, not climate change, but climate control-related. We basically cut that in half. The big driver for our business and for the industry is that everything is getting electrified – and we've been an unexpected and happy beneficiary of some evolution in the federal regulatory landscape that’s supporting geothermal.

But again, things are getting electrified. We've seen it first and most notably with transportation and electric vehicles, but it's coming for heating now, too. In fact, for the last two years, more heat pumps have been sold than natural gas furnaces in the U.S., which is surprising to most people. That's trend one. Trend two is that there's a tremendous amount of pressure on the electric grid, and demand is going up most notably from AI data centers, but also just from the broader electrification initiatives.

Geothermal is by far the least impactful on the electric grid of any electric heating option. A homebuyer will enjoy half the energy consumption or utility bills from a geothermal system compared to a conventional air source heat pump.

How deep do you need to drill for a home system?

It's a question of the capacity or the heating demand of the house. As a general matter, it’s about 100 to 150 feet for every ton of heating. A typical new home requires maybe three tons, so that’s about 400 feet.

What's the approximate size of the hole you’re boring? And what are you installing in it?

Five-and-a-half inches. It’s a very narrow bore.

We install a ground loop, which is two pipes that are really right next to each other, and then they're connected at just the bottom with what's called a U-bend that connects the two pipes of the water. It flows down one and then comes right back up the other one. We run that down to the bottom, along with a third pipe that's called a tremie line. You end up with a fully cemented-in finished product where there's really no environmental interaction. It's locked in there, it's done.

I jokingly call our kind of geothermal “lukewarm geothermal.” A system like Fervo’s is going much deeper and looking for 500-degree heat, where they’re trying to make steam. … What we do is suck the heat out of the water that's circulating through this loop and concentrate that heat up to 110 degrees, then pump that, blowing air over it to circulate air into the house to heat the house. Then we're pumping water back down into the hole that's now almost at freezing, so we actually put antifreeze in the water. You'll have 30-degree water going back into the hole, and then that water gets heated up from the 50-degree Earth. Then we suck the heat out of that water again and push it into the house. It's a classic refrigeration cycle where you're making something hotter than the surrounding area by pushing heat into the hotter area.

The classic performance metric for a heat pump is COP, the coefficient of power, which is how many units of energy do you produce for every unit of heat that you consume from electricity? Our systems regularly have a COP around 5 or in the low 4s, and that's the full seasonal lifecycle of the system. What you'll see listed as the highest efficiency air source heat pumps will be in the 3s, but then when you get to the coldest days of the year, they drop into the 2s, and many of them drop into the 1s. So we end up having this major overperformance relative to conventional heat pumps.

You’re leasing systems to homeowners. So what does using this type of heating and cooling system cost, factoring in federal and state incentives?

We are already the happy recipient of a number of state-level incentives. We've got a lot of activity in the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and in Colorado. All of these regions have pretty robust state-level incentives that encourage geothermal.

One detail with federal rules is the tax credit is only available to commercially-owned geothermal systems. You can't build a home with geothermal, sell it to the home buyer, and then they go and file for the credit. They're not a commercial entity. The system doesn't have to be in a commercial building. It just has to be owned by a corporation, essentially.

That's where leasing came in. [Congress] inserted language that said geothermal systems can be leased. And that allowed us to take this sizable credit. The base credit is 30%, but you get 10% extra if the system is built, predominantly, in the U.S. – and essentially all geothermal systems are. So it's effectively a 40% credit across the board.

Our leasing partners typically will structure something like 20-year leases. The punchline is that the homebuyers are paying anywhere from as little as $15 bucks a month to $60, sort of in that range. And they're saving anywhere from $600 to $1,000 a year.

Sourced from the EU Emissions Trading System, these projects will benefit from a total of €643 million to help deploy their ground-breaking decarbonisation solutions.

The projects are expected to enter into operation between 2027 and 2029 and should reduce emissions by some 88 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over their first ten years of operation.

Located across four EU Member States, these projects represent a major boost to Europe’s manufacturing industry and the emerging battery ecosystem. Implementing innovative processes and technologies, they will support key segments of the battery value chain with advanced material production, cell manufacturing, recycling technologies and second-life applications.

Their combined impact will contribute to:

the creation of direct and indirect jobs

increased European autonomy and reduced dependence on external suppliers

By accelerating the commercialisation of next-generation EV battery innovations, the projects will play a key role in delivering on the EU’s climate and industrial objectives, while strengthening technological competitiveness and resilience.

As a key clean technology, EV batteries advance the objectives of theClean Industrial Deal and Industrial Action Plan for the European automobile sector by supporting the business case for products necessary in the clean transition and improving Europe’s competitiveness in this area. They are also in line with the objectives of the Net-Zero Industry Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act by reducing dependence on imported materials and building resilient, sustainable supply chains. Their second life and recycling applications align with the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. Finally, the projects selected under this call are consistent with the Batteries Regulation, which promotes a competitive and sustainable European battery industry.

Background

A Grant Agreement is the formal contract between the European Commission and the project beneficiary that defines the project’s objectives, funding amount, eligible costs, rights, and obligations under the Innovation Fund.

The Innovation Fund 2024 Battery call was launched on 3 December 2024 and closed on 24 April 2025, attracting 14 applications from across Europe. In July 2025, the European Commission announced that six projects were invited to enter the grant preparation phase. One of the six invited projects decided to withdraw from grant preparation, resulting in five successfully signing their Grant Agreements with CINEA.

With an estimated revenue of €40 billion (calculated based on a carbon price of €75 per tonne of CO2) from the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030, the Innovation Fund seeks to drive investment in cutting-edge, low-carbon and net-zero technologies, supporting Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.

Also launched in 2024, the Innovation Fund call for proposals for net-zero technologies has recently announced the 61 projects selected for grant agreement preparation along with its second renewable hydrogen auction under the European Hydrogen Bank. Grant agreements for both the call and auction are expected to be signed in the coming months.

(TSXV: SURG) (OTCQB: SRGXF) (Frankfurt: G6D2) (“Surge” or the “Company”) provides its perspective on recent policy and infrastructure developments that strengthen Canada’s critical minerals framework and investment climate. These initiatives, spanning fiscal incentives announced in the 2025 Federal Budget, the launch of the G7 Critical Minerals Alliance, and provincial investments in transmission infrastructure in British Columbia, highlight the evolving landscape for responsible development of projects such as the Company’s 100%-owned Berg copper-molybdenum project in west-central British Columbia.

Federal Budget 2025: Expanded Support for Critical Minerals

The Government of Canada’s 2025 Federal Budget introduced several measures that reinforce national competitiveness in critical minerals development. Key initiatives include:

Expansion of the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit (CTMITC): Budget 2025 confirms the federal government’s intention to proceed with previously announced measures to expand eligibility under this 30 percent refundable tax credit (which can eliminate a company’s income tax payable in a given year and provide a cash refund for any remaining balance), including the addition of new critical minerals and support for polymetallic mining and processing activities. Once implemented, these measures could meaningfully expand access to this important fiscal incentive for projects such as Berg, where the majority of production by value is anticipated to come from copper.

Extension and expansion of the Critical Minerals Exploration Tax Credit: Budget 2025 broadens eligibility for this flow-through-share incentive to include molybdenum and other transition metals, reflecting the federal government’s recognition of their importance in high-performance steel and industrial, technological, and energy applications. Molybdenum represents a significant component of the Berg resource and a key value driver for the project.

Creation of new federal investment vehicles: Budget 2025 outlines new and expanded federally funded investment vehicles, including the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund and the First and Last Mile Fund, aimed at providing direct equity and infrastructure support to qualifying projects.

Enhanced coordination of federal project financing initiatives: Budget 2025 introduces a new framework to align Canada’s major project financing institutions, including the Major Projects Office, Canada Infrastructure Bank, Canada Growth Fund, Export Development Canada, and the Canada Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corporation. The initiative is designed to streamline access to capital and coordinate support for “nation-building” projects that advance clean growth, economic competitiveness, and Indigenous participation. This integrated approach aims to accelerate the development of large-scale strategic projects across Canada’s resource and infrastructure sectors.

Collectively, these measures may influence the economic framework for Canadian critical minerals projects and provide potential incentives for advanced development projects such as Berg.

G7 Critical Minerals Alliance: Global Demand Alignment

Canada’s leadership role in the newly established G7 Critical Minerals Alliance underscores an international commitment to developing secure, transparent, and standards-based supply chains for materials essential to modern industrial, technological, and energy systems. Surge believes this framework will encourage long-term cooperation between allied nations and may support diversified and transparent supply chains for responsibly produced critical minerals, including copper and molybdenum concentrates.

As a potential future producer of copper and molybdenum concentrates with no offtake agreements yet in place, Berg offers flexibility to supply either domestic processors or allied markets, aligning with Canada’s goal of diversifying exports beyond the United States and strengthening trusted supply chains.

British Columbia: Enabling Infrastructure and Investment Climate

Complementing federal and international initiatives, the Government of British Columbia has advanced the North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL), a multi-phase transmission project intended to expand grid capacity in the northwest of the province to support growth in sectors such as ports, mining, and LNG. Under Bill 31 (Energy Statutes Amendment Act, 2025), the Province is fast-tracking the project by amending legislation to allow co-ownership with First Nations, streamline permitting, and adjust the electricity-allocation framework such that connection priority is given to vital growth industries (including mining and resource development) rather than the typical first-come, first-served basis. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 with phased in-service dates targeted around 2030.

While the Berg Project does not strictly depend on the NCTL for its power connection, the initiative creates important flexibility in a region where demand for industrial electricity is rapidly escalating. It reflects the government’s proactive recognition of potential infrastructure bottlenecks and its willingness to act in advance to unlock resource development.

Positioning of the Berg Project

With these converging policy developments, Berg is well aligned with current federal and provincial initiatives supporting critical minerals development. The project’s large-scale copper and molybdenum resource, favourable logistics, and low-carbon, hydro-powered design align directly with national and international priorities for responsible resource development.

“Recent policy developments, including Budget 2025 measures and federal and provincial infrastructure initiatives, highlight Canada’s efforts to strengthen its critical minerals sector,” said Leif Nilsson, CEO of Surge. “Projects such as Berg illustrate how these policy measures could create opportunities for advancing critical minerals development in Canada through coordinated efforts among industry, government, and Indigenous partners.”

FirstEnergy subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison will file plans with the West Virginia Public Service Commission in early 2026 to pursue one of two options for the new gas generation: partnering with another company to build and transfer the plant to the companies, or building it independently with construction and design experts. A site for the new plant has not yet been determined.

“This planned generation is a promise – a promise to keep energy costs manageable, to ensure reliability during peak demand and to support local investment and job creation,” FirstEnergy Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian X. Tierney said. “It’s a promise to West Virginia families, workers and industries that FirstEnergy is here for the long haul.”

In addition to the construction jobs, a study by West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research reports the gas plant’s ongoing operations are estimated to support nearly 2,200 direct and indirect jobs and $85.9 million in annual state and local tax revenue. This includes three dozen permanent, technically advanced positions at the plant and hundreds of jobs in West Virginia’s natural gas industry.

Tierney said the new generation would work alongside the company’s existing plants to deliver consistent, reliable power for customers, supporting a strong energy future for West Virginia.

“It will be designed to work in concert with our existing energy infrastructure, including the Harrison Power Station and Ft. Martin Power Station, supporting a balanced and reliable energy mix that leverages all of West Virginia’s abundant resources to power all of the state’s generation,” he said.

“We want developers and decision-makers to see that West Virginia isn’t just adjacent to opportunity, it is the opportunity,” Tierney added. “With this investment, we’re laying the groundwork for data centers, advanced manufacturers and other innovative businesses to choose West Virginia as the place to grow, invest and thrive.”

In addition to new generation capacity, FirstEnergy is upgrading transmission lines, strengthening local poles and wires and implementing advanced grid technologies to build a more resilient electric system across West Virginia.

“Our commitment to West Virginia’s future is expansive,” Tierney said. “Between 2025 and 2029, we plan to invest $5.2 billion in West Virginia in infrastructure enhancements, people, processes and facilities. Pending regulatory approval of this generation, we anticipate investing an additional $2.5 billion – further accelerating economic growth and opportunity throughout the region.”

The company argues the proposed new generation supports Governor Morrisey’s “50 by 50” initiative, which aims to boost West Virginia’s energy capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/american-public-power-association-XGAZzyLzn18-unsplash-scaled-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:25.559112

The Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners has approved and certified the final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) Scattergood Generating Station Units 1 and 2 Green Hydrogen-Ready Modernization Project.

“The Board’s approval of the EIR Scattergood Generating Station Units 1 and 2 Green Hydrogen-Ready Modernization Project is monumental not only for LADWP but the City of Los Angeles,” said LADWP CEO and Chief Engineer Janisse Quiñones. “The Scattergood project is a critical clean energy solution for Los Angeles that will also maintain power reliability and grid resiliency especially as we face more unpredictable threats to our electrical system and our environment.”

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process for the project was initiated in 2023 and included community outreach that captured comments during the public review period. According to project filings, LADWP is proposing to install fuel-flexible combined cycle equipment capable of burning significant amounts of renewable energy-sourced hydrogen to replace the generating capacity currently provided by SGS Units 1 and 2. The 346 MW project would cost an estimated $800 million, with an in-service date of Dec. 30, 2029.

Scattergood Generating Station provides firm energy capacity in-basin. The plant provides local generation capability by bridging power shortfalls including periods of extreme demand during high heat, earthquakes and wildfires, as occurred in January 2025. Scattergood is also meant to provide the insurance of local power generation when LADWP works on transmission line upgrades to bring in more renewable energy from outside the basin. In addition, the completion of the modernization project at Scattergood will help ensure that LADWP meets California’s regulatory mandates related to Once Through Cooling.

The modernization project at Scattergood entails replacing the generating capacity of the existing Scattergood Units 1 and 2, which are conventional natural-gas-fired steam-boiler generators, with a rapid-response combined-cycle generation system (CCGS) capable of operating on a fuel mixture of natural gas and a minimum of 30 percent hydrogen by volume. The proposed CCGS would consist of a combustion-turbine generator and a steam-turbine generator operating in tandem.

A Request for Proposals to execute the Scattergood Modernization Project is closing in November, and the Board of Water and Power Commissioners must review and approve the contract award before it proceeds. The project is expected to be in service by the end of 2029.

Loans currently make up two-thirds of climate finance for the Global South, with some countries, like France, providing 86% of their climate finance through loans.","The third decade of United Nations climate negotiations opened on Monday in the Brazilian Amazon, as 50,000 negotiators, politicians, civil society representatives, industry lobbyists, and indigenous peoples from around the world gathered for talks on protecting the planet from climate catastrophe.

The thirtieth anniversary of COP summits has little time to celebrate: Ten years after the world agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, that threshold has been breached.

Brazil insisted on hosting the talks in Belém, a small coastal city on the Amazon’s edge, to place the rainforest, nature, planet and people negotiators are there to protect at the center of negotiations.

Limited hotels and housing has delegates housed on mammoth cruise ships casting long shadows over local fishing villages. Others will spend the week in local, pay-by-the-hour love motels. All will be working under the heavy humidity and heat of the world’s largest rainforest, a constant reminder of the climate future awaiting the billions around the world if negotiations fail.

“Climate change is not a threat of the future, it is already a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening plenary, citing the hurricane that levelled Jamaica and a “trail of destruction, droughts, fires in Africa and Europe, floods in South America and South East Asia” that have killed thousands and displaced millions.

“The climate emergency is a case of inequality, it exposes and exacerbates the unacceptable,” Lula said.

He also attacked rising military spending, arguing the world should prioritise climate finance over defence budgets. “The men that go to war, if they were here, present here, at this COP, they would perceive that it’s much cheaper to put $1.3 trillion for us to end the climate crisis than to put $2 trillion and sell $700 billion to buy weapons and go to war,” he said.

Progress has been made since Paris. The planet was then on pace for 4°C of warming by century’s end. Today’s business-as-usual scenario projects 2.8°C. If countries implement their Paris commitments, warming could fall to between 2.3°C and 2.5°C.

Unlike previous summits, COP30 is not expected to produce a landmark agreement. Instead, the focus is implementation: meeting the promises made in Paris, Baku and Dubai to raise climate finance, transition away from fossil fuels, and return warming to under 1.5°C.

The tasks ahead may be the most difficult COP in years: find the money, international cooperation and political will to protect billions facing life or death on current warming projections.

In his inaugural address as COP president, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago said three priorities will dominate the agenda: climate adaptation, finance for a just transition, and implementing the global stocktake recommendations on clean energy and reversing deforestation.

“This is a COP of implementation,” said Corrêa do Lago. “I hope it will be remembered as a COP of adaptation, a COP of advancing climate integration with economic activity and generation of jobs, and above all, a COP which will hear and believe in science.”

‘COP of truth’

The latest COP is the first in several years not to be clouded by the smoke and scandal of petrostate hosts.

The last two climate summits, held in the UAE and Azerbaijan, two nations heavily reliant on state owned oil conglomerates for government revenue, were hit with scandals alleging subterfuge and coordination between the chiefs of negotiations and fossil fuel interests seeking to weaken any global agreement.

This year, pressure on the negotiations comes from outside the host nation, as the United States, the world’s largest historical emitter, spurns the talks entirely. Presidents Xi and Modi of China and India, topping off the list of the world’s three largest polluters, will not attend the Brazil summit, either.

A fear of US influence from Washington looms over the talks despite them not sending a team. The Trump administration has used intimidation and economic threats to derail recent talks over maritime climate taxes, and employed similar tactics at the failed plastics treaty negotiations in Geneva in August.

Last week, Donald Trump declared on social media following an opinion piece by Bill Gates in which he argued for a change in the framing of climate change from a “doomsday view” to more optimistic framing to galvanise action: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax.”

“Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue,” Trump declared.

Brazilian President Lula has sought to frame COP30 as a direct counter to forces such as the US administration, who nixed all US climate commitments made by his predecessor, calling climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated” and a “hoax”.

European Union officials have taken a similar tack. The bloc’s chief negotiator, Jacob Werksman, said last week COP30 must press on against the “strong counter narrative that’s coming from a particular part of the world, suggesting that climate change is a hoax.”

In an indirect swipe at the US in his opening remarks, Lula referred to a coalition of ‘denialists’ which he said: “reject not only the evidence and science,” but attack multilateralism, spread “hatred and fear,” and “attack institutions, science and universities.”

“Now is the moment to defeat the denialists,” Lula said.

The Brazilian president’s crusade against climate denialism stems from personal experience. Under the nation’s previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump dismissed climate change as a hoax, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached record heights and Brazil was entirely absent from the global stage. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for organizing a coup against Lula.

Under his presidency, Brazil’s emissions fell nearly 17% last year – the biggest drop in 15 years – as his government cracked down on illegal deforestation.

Whether the United States – which has never truly stepped into the climate leadership role its historical emissions would suggest – might one day follow a similar path from climate denial back to engagement remains an open question. But Brazil’s transformation shows it’s possible.

‘Growth story of the 21st century’

As green technology surges ahead, climate denial is increasingly at odds with basic economics. While the US retreats from climate leadership, China is moving to consolidate its dominance in renewable energy manufacturing and deployment, positioning itself to dominate the energy markets of the future.

“The economics of this transition are as indisputable as the costs of inaction,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates. “Solar and wind are now the lowest-cost power in 90% of the world. Renewables overtook coal this year as the world’s top energy source.”

“This is the growth story of the 21st Century, the economic transformation of our age,” Stiell said. “Those opting out or taking baby steps face stagnation and higher prices, while other economies surge ahead.”

But translating that economic momentum into the financing needed for a global transition remains the central – and likely insurmountable – challenge of COP30.

At the opening ceremony of COP30, outgoing president Mukhtar Babayev presented delegates with an “invoice for climate justice”, a document outlining the minimum financial commitments required from wealthy nations.

The invoice includes: $40 billion in urgent adaptation finance by 2025, tripling climate funds to $5.1 billion by 2030, and the $300 billion annual pledge by 2035 that emerged from last year’s negotiations.

The total including the aspirational $1.3 trillion annual climate funding target in the Baku finance deal? Several trillion.

The invoice is addressed specifically to what are known as Annex II countries under the UN climate convention: 39 developed nations identified in 1992 when the framework was first opened for signing. These include the United States, European Union members, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, and a handful of others.

But the US, historically the world’s largest emitter and responsible for roughly 40% of climate finance under this framework, has walked away from the table. The gap in the $1.3 trillion annual target agreed in Baku created by a US exit breaks the math: The EU and other Annex II nations cannot shoulder $1.3 trillion, or even the scaled-back $300bn commitment, on their own.

This leads to the second, politically fraught problem that has plagued environmental negotiations from plastics, to biodiversity and climate alike for years: several of the world’s wealthiest nations – China, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Poland, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico – are classified as developing countries under the 1992 framework. They are not obligated to contribute climate finance, and they have so far largely refused to do so voluntarily.

Since then, China’s cumulative emissions have surpassed the EU’s while it has become the world’s second-largest economy. Early drafts of the Baku agreement proposed expanding the donor list to include some of these nations. That language was quietly dropped from the final text, leaving the donor list unchanged.

China, the world’s largest annual emitter, contributes approximately $3.8 billion per year in climate finance, a fraction of what it would owe under a system based on current emissions or economic capacity. It does provide developing nations with cheap green technology, but resists any formal obligation to pay into global climate funds.

Analysis by the Center for Global Development suggests that by 2030, non-Annex II nations should collectively shoulder around 30% of total climate finance, with Annex II countries covering the remaining 70%.

Even the $300bn target, however, remains distant. Current climate finance flows are estimated between $28 billion, according to Oxfam, which excludes loans, and $116 billion by OECD figures, which count loans equally with grants. The $1.3tn economists say is needed grows more remote with each passing year as inflation and continued warming increase the cost of adaptation and mitigation.

The Baku agreement also made a key compromise to get it over the line: leaving unresolved whether loans should count toward the finance target. Loans currently make up two-thirds of climate finance for the Global South, with some countries, like France, providing 86% of their climate finance through loans.

If this loan-to-grant ratio continues, approximately $200 billion of the $300 billion 2035 target would come as loans rather than grants, which developing countries argue perpetuates rather than solves their debt crises.

“We now need to put the Baku to Belém roadmap to work to start moving towards the 1.3 trillion,” Stiell said.

Billions of lives, species, and nations

The planet warming in line with the latest projections is a matter of life and death for billions of people, species, and nations.

Over half a million people have died every year due to heat exposure over the past decade. Millions die due to air pollution. Conflicts drive resource wars, while droughts cause famine and displacement. Extreme weather destroys homes, while sea level rise threatens nations themselves.

The UNHCR’s latest report, released on the opening day of the summit, adds to the reality just decades away – or already here – for the world’s most vulnerable populations.

“Three in every four refugees and other displaced people fleeing war and persecution now live in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate-related hazards,” UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said. “These communities face an impossible reality – they are being hit harder by more devastating floods, longer droughts and periods of extreme heat, without the means to adapt, recover and rebuild.”

Of the 117 million people displaced by conflict today, around 75% – 86 million – are exposed to extreme weather. The one million refugees who returned home in the first half of this year returned to countries highly vulnerable to more of the climate impacts that displaced them in the first place.

“Whilst mega droughts wreck national harvests, sending food prices soaring, it makes zero sense, economically or politically, to squabble while famines take hold, forcing millions to flee their homelands – this will never be forgotten,” Stiell said. “As conflicts spread while climate disasters decimate the lives of millions when we already have the solutions this will never, ever be forgiven.”

“We have already agreed that transition pathways must be inclusive and just, covering whole economies and societies,” the UNFCCC chief added. “Now we must agree on concrete steps to turn aspirations into actions.”

Health is back

https://www.twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1987182305517986083?s=20

The World Health Organization, in collaboration with Wellcome and the global health community, is hosting a Health Pavilion at COP30 in the Blue Zone throughout the talks to showcase evidence and solutions to maximise the health benefits of tackling climate change across regions, sectors and communities.

“A sick planet means sick people,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told delegates at the opening. “The climate crisis is a health crisis – not in the future, but now. It is already spreading disease, worsening malnutrition, displacing communities, and claiming lives through heat, floods, fires, and pollution.”

Featured organizations include WHO, Gavi, the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, UNITAID, national health agencies, academic institutions, the International Committee of the Red Cross and pharmaceutical industry representatives.

It’s an apparent upgrade from last year’s COP29 in Baku, where WHO’s marquee health event took place in a cramped, windowless meeting room and peaked at just 18 attendees on a Microsoft Teams call.

The meeting resulted in a “letter of intent” to form a coalition to continue discussions about taking action – the kind of bureaucratic outcome that has left health advocates frustrated after decades fighting for recognition at climate talks.

Beyond the political rhetoric, health-specific climate action remains severely underfunded, capturing only 2% of adaptation funding and 0.5% of multilateral climate funding.

“Health is the strongest argument for climate action,” Tedros said. “It’s much easier to convince people of the need to protect their own health or that of their children, than to protect glaciers or ecosystems. Both are important. One is a lot closer to home.”

“Put health at the centre of every climate decision. Direct climate finance towards protecting lives and livelihoods. And recognise health as a measure of climate ambition and success. Because there can be no healthy people on a sick planet.”

The talks continue through November 21.",https://i0.wp.com/healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54914367220_05f2ee1f93_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:08.758790

Located on a 1.5-kilometer stretch of the A10 motorway near Paris, this pilot project demonstrates dynamic wireless power transfer at speeds up to 300 kilowatts—surpassing even Tesla’s Supercharger network. Developed by Israeli firm Electreon in collaboration with VINCI Autoroutes and Gustave Eiffel University, the system embeds copper coils beneath the asphalt to generate a magnetic field, allowing equipped vehicles to charge seamlessly while driving.

Early tests have shown impressive results: cars, buses, and heavy trucks receiving continuous power at around 200 kW, with peaks hitting 300 kW. This innovation addresses key EV adoption barriers like range anxiety and lengthy charging stops, as reported by TechRadar. According to Electreon’s CEO Oren Ezer, ‘This is a pivotal moment for zero-emission mobility,’ highlighting the system’s potential for widespread adoption.

Pioneering Dynamic Charging Technology

The technology relies on inductive charging, where underground coils create an electromagnetic field that transfers energy to receivers on vehicles. Unlike static wireless charging pads, this dynamic version operates at highway speeds, making it ideal for long-haul routes. Fox News detailed how the French pilot delivered over 300 kW to multiple vehicles simultaneously, potentially eliminating the need for large battery packs in trucks, as per Fox News.

Electreon’s system has been tested globally, but this French deployment marks the first on a public highway. Posts on X from users like Disclose.tv emphasize its expansion plans to the U.S., Europe, and Asia, underscoring the technology’s scalability. The project, launched in late October 2025, involved rigorous testing with vehicles like the Iveco eDaily van and Renault Master, achieving charge rates that double the power for heavy vehicles compared to lighter ones.

Overcoming Infrastructure Challenges

Cost remains a significant hurdle, with installations estimated at nearly $2 million per mile, as noted in a BBC article on similar U.S. trials in Detroit (BBC). However, proponents argue that long-term savings from reduced battery sizes and downtime could offset this. In France, the A10 segment integrates with existing infrastructure, minimizing disruptions during construction.

Electrek reported on the trial’s world-first achievement, where four vehicles charged at up to 300 kW on a 1.5 km road (Electrek). This surpasses Tesla’s V3 Superchargers, which max out at 250 kW, and even approaches the V4’s potential. Industry insiders view this as a game-changer for freight trucking, where electric options have lagged due to charging logistics.

Global Precedents and Comparisons

Sweden pioneered a permanent electrified road in 2023, planning 3,000 km by 2035, according to Euronews (Euronews). Meanwhile, Indiana’s Department of Transportation announced magnetizable concrete highways in 2021 (INDOT). France’s version stands out for its high power output and multi-vehicle capability.

On X, posts from Indian Infra Report and Mossad Commentary highlight the Israeli innovation behind Electreon’s tech, with views exceeding 300,000, signaling strong public interest. The Indian Express noted the highway’s ability to charge at up to 200 kW continuously for buses and trucks (The Indian Express).

Implications for Heavy-Duty Vehicles

For electric freight trucking, this technology could be transformative. Electreon’s press release via PR Newswire states that heavy trucks received twice the power, enabling zero-emission long-haul operations (PR Newswire). New Atlas described early results showing over 300 kW transfers, making tailgating trucks an efficient charging strategy (New Atlas).

Cenex, in a 2025 report, discussed the rise of wireless charging in EV infrastructure, noting projects like Detroit’s quarter-mile road (Cenex). X posts from Sawyer Merritt in 2023 echoed this, with Detroit’s installation activating for equipped vehicles only.

Economic and Environmental Impact

Adopting such highways could accelerate EV uptake, reducing fossil fuel dependence. Electreon’s website claims their solutions charge vehicles while driving or idling, promoting sustainable mobility (Electreon). In France, this aligns with EU goals for net-zero emissions by 2050, as seen in X posts from NBCUniversal Catalyst about EV charging innovations.

However, challenges include retrofitting vehicles with receivers and ensuring compatibility across manufacturers. Industry experts, quoted in Carscoops, suggest this could make plug-in stations obsolete (Carscoops). Expansion plans, as per ESG Post, target broader European networks (ESG Post).

Future Prospects and Scalability

Looking ahead, Electreon plans pilots in the U.S. and Asia, building on this success. X sentiment, from users like Mario Nawfal discussing Sweden’s e-roads, shows growing excitement for eliminating range anxiety. TechPulse Daily on X praised the French system’s speed over Tesla’s network.

Ultimately, this French breakthrough, as detailed in multiple sources, positions dynamic wireless charging as a cornerstone of future EV ecosystems, with potential to revolutionize global transportation infrastructure.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-802-1762749406.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 18:01:03.308998

“Our partnership with Meta marks a critical milestone for Treaty Oak and our commitment to support our customers and their growing clean energy needs in MISO’s Southern footprint, as well as our broader mission to deliver impactful, scalable clean energy solutions across the U.S.,” said Rohit Ogra, co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer of Treaty Oak. “Together with Meta, we’re strengthening local energy resilience, supporting economic development, and creating long-term value for the communities in which we operate in Louisiana.”

“Our partnership with Treaty Oak reflects Meta’s and Treaty Oak’s shared commitment to bringing new, additional clean energy to the local grid,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of Global Energy. “When we announced our AI [artificial intelligence] data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid—and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana.”

“Beekman Solar in Morehouse Parish and Hollis Creek Solar in Sabine Parish represent our strategy coming to life,” said Elrod. He told POWER, “We’ve worked closely with local officials, landowners, and community leaders in both parishes, and we appreciate the strong support that has helped us advance these projects through the approval process. We’re excited to bring these facilities online in 2027 to support Meta’s operations in the region, and these projects are important milestones toward our goal of delivering 1 gigawatt of clean power in Louisiana by the end of the decade.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Building on a growing energy-related research portfolio, Mississippi State University is launching the Energy Resilience and Innovation Hub to foster collaboration and innovation that will support the Magnolia State’s future energy needs.

Led by MSU Associate Vice President for Research and Economic Development Narcisa Pricope, the unit will serve as a thinktank and collaborative hub working to catalyze economic growth, strengthen community and institutional energy resilience, foster policy alignment, and promote access to energy resources.

“The Energy Resilience and Innovation Hub will bring together researchers, industry partners and communities to accelerate innovation and ensure Mississippi remains at the forefront of a secure and sustainable energy future,” Pricope said. “This initiative underscores our commitment to advancing technologies and strategies that strengthen energy systems statewide and beyond.”

The hub was announced at this month’s Mississippi Water and Energy Conference hosted by MSU. Pricope noted MSU is working toward several projects that tackle areas such as energy efficiency, local government retrofits and audits, water-energy resilience, policy and workforce, and renewable site planning. The new initiative builds on existing MSU expertise in energy systems, grid resilience, clean fuels, energy storage, artificial intelligence and carbon utilization.

The hub will provide a dedicated space for sharing information, building partnerships and aligning research and development efforts across multiple sectors. As energy systems evolve, the initiative will support emerging workforce development needs to ensure Mississippians are ready to take advantage of current and future job opportunities in the energy sector.

During the conference, Pricope said MSU was recently awarded $1.2 million to support R-STEP: Renewable Energy Siting Through Technical Engagement and Planning. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and allocated through the Mississippi Development Authority, the project will support site planning and permitting for renewable energy developments in Mississippi.

With training and outreach carried out by MSU Extension’s Center for Government and Development, the funding will be used to build capacity and develop renewable energy playbooks tailored to Mississippi’s needs.

Vantage Data Centers Plans $2B Virginia Investment

More detailed information is available for another recent data center announcement: Vantage Data Centers will invest $2 billion to build a state-of-the-art data center campus in Stafford County, Virginia. At full capacity, the project will create 50 new jobs in the Commonwealth.

“Fredericksburg offered a significant opportunity for Vantage to serve our customers seeking capacity and access to the resources of Data Center Alley,” said Vantage Data Centers North America President Dana Adams. “The region’s proximity to major metros, access to robust infrastructure, and growing technology ecosystem make it an ideal location to meet skyrocketing demand. Virginia has been a cornerstone of Vantage’s North American growth since we first entered the market in 2017, and we’re pleased to expand our presence to Fredericksburg—helping establish it as a meaningful digital hub while contributing to the region’s economic growth and technological advancements.”

Located just over an hour from Vantage’s three existing Virginia campuses in Northern Virginia, the new campus — dubbed VA4 — will house three data centers on 82 acres, totaling approximately 929,000 square feet, bringing the company’s statewide capacity to 782MW with a combined investment of approximately $8 billion. The campus will be built to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification and in alignment with Vantage’s “sustainable by design” blueprint, operating with a closed-loop chilled water system that minimizes the need for large volumes of water for cooling and supports Vantage’s industry-leading low water usage effectiveness. The new campus will feature liquid-to-liquid cooling with CDU-based equipment capable of handling 100% of IT workloads. The first building is scheduled to open in late 2027.

“Thanks to companies like Vantage, Virginia is leading the world into a future powered by the limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “With this $2 billion in investment, Vantage is paving the way for a stronger Stafford County and a stronger Virginia. This project reflects our commitment to innovation, job creation, and economic growth — and it’s another example of how Virginia is winning for families and businesses alike.”

“As AI promises to transform the way we live and work, data center development like Vantage’s VA4 campus are placing Virginia at the center of it all,” said Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “By moving at the speed of business, we are ensuring that these centers can begin serving communities and providing vital revenue for many years to come.”

Launched in 2010 with one data center in California, Vantage has since expanded to more than 30 campuses across five continents.

Austin, TX – Sustainable business advocates and faith-based investment organizations have taken action to block wide enforcement of a new Texas law, known as SB 2337, that would prevent investors from having unrestricted access to expert advice about their investments. The filing argues that SB 2337 violates the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The law’s restrictions on advice given to investors as they consider matters affecting their investments are a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of investors and advisors. Today, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, United Church Funds, and Ceres filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas seeking to stop Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing the unconstitutional law. The coalition is represented by Democracy Forward in the matter.

In late August, a federal judge enjoined enforcement of the law against the two dominant firms in the world of shareholder proxy advising – Glass Lewis and ISS. The law, however, remains in effect for other organizations, and its scope covers a wide range of activities that are related to shareholder advocacy and proxy advising. Among other things, the law exposes non-profit organizations to liability.

The plaintiffs are faith-based and non-profit organizations that, as part of their missions, partner with institutional investors to engage with companies to seek strong long-term financial performance. As part of that work, the plaintiffs take into account environmental and social impacts of company practices, as well as strong corporate governance and other factors, because they believe – correctly – that these factors can be central to the long-term financial success of companies. SB 2337 classifies those factors as “nonfinancial” and places burdensome restrictions on sharing such considerations with shareholders.

“This law restricts the freedom to invest. Hiding the truth about important long-term aspects of their investments is a disservice to investors. Doing so is not just bad for the future of our communities and our planet, but it is also unconstitutional,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of DemocracyForward. “Our team at Democracy Forward is honored to work with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, United Church Funds, and Ceres to defend the right to speak about investments and exercise shareholder rights in Texas.”

“This attempt to silence investors is an unacceptable attack on the First Amendment and the rights of Americans across the country, all in service to special interests. A robust and dynamic economy requires honest competition and the free exchange of ideas that leaders in Texas are seeking to undermine with this law. For these reasons and in light of our longstanding mission to support faith- and values-based investors, we are grateful for the opportunity to join this lawsuit,” said Josh Zinner, Chief Executive Officer of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.

“Our approach to investing has always joined faith and fiduciary duty,” said Rev. Dr. Charles C. Buck, President and CEO of United Church Funds. “Texas’s law is written so vaguely that even ordinary, good-faith stewardship could be misinterpreted as unlawful. Responsible investors shouldn’t have to guess whether sharing our values or our analysis puts us at risk for simply doing our jobs.”

The Democracy Forward legal team working on the case includes Victoria Nugent, Tsuki Hoshijima, and Jennifer Fountain Connolly.

The state's rising population is driving the need for more power, but data centers, including the ones AI relies on, need more power, too.

He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.
EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been modified to correct that Arizona Public Service ended its goal to be carbon zero by 2050.","Artificial intelligence is increasingly creeping into our lives. And in support of that super technology, nondescript data centers are popping up in cities, towns and even near cattle ranches.

They require lots of power — creating new challenges for utilities.

The largest utility in Arizona has a problem. It needs more energy.

""It's hard in the world we live in today to live without electricity,"" said Johnny Penrod, who works for Arizona Public Service.

And the buzzing sound from this power plant in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe is relatively quiet. But if the power turbines were on, we wouldn't be able to talk.

""Basically like a 737 jet engine is what it is,"" Penrod said.

Demand for power in Arizona is expected to keep rising. And meeting that demand can mean life or death in the desert, where temperatures stay above 110 degrees in the summer.

""Here, we can do something to make sure we keep the lights on for our customers,"" said Penrod.

And to keep the air conditioners running.

So, the utility has turned to a pipeline company to bring in more natural gas from Texas. The state's rising population is driving the need for more power, but data centers, including the ones AI relies on, need more power, too.

""I think natural gas is going to play that part,"" said Penrod.

Kevin Thompson is chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities. Renewables, including solar, are a part of the utility's portfolio, but not as reliable at all times. So data centers raise an immediate issue.

""It's going to take more generation. It's going to take dispatchable, reliable generation that can be dispatched at night time,"" said Thompson.

The Department of Energy estimates the demand from data centers could nearly triple in the next three years. Nationally, they could use 12% of all energy.

The Trump administration's energy secretary, Chris Wright, spoke about meeting that skyrocketing demand recently with the Council on Foreign Relations.

""With his abundant source of natural gas, that's what's going to power our data centers,"" said Wright.

The national renewable energy laboratory tracks data centers, and their map shows some of the major hot spots in the Mountain West — from Wyoming to Colorado, Utah to Nevada and, of course, Arizona, where driverless taxis are an increasingly common sight.

Tom Maples pages through notes at the DPR Construction office.

He's a project manager with the company, which builds data centers. One of his latest projects was for Meta — in another Phoenix suburb.

""It's really growing very fast in Arizona and around the country, moreso in the last two years,"" said Maples.

Maples says building energy efficient data centers is just good business. But many will still contend with high utility bills.

""As AI has come on,"" he said, ""there's a lot more electricity being consumed.""

Amid this unprecedented demand, some major utilities have slowed their transitions to renewables. Arizona Public Service is among them. It ended its goal to be carbon zero by 2050.

Some are concerned the demand is pushing residential bills up, like Abhay Padgoankar, a consumer advocate. He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.

""They don't have the capacity for it,"" Padgoankar said.

The utility says it's more complicated than that though. Still residential bills jumped about 8% last year.

""We as residential customers are doing the right things by conserving energy ... by installing solar, by buying energy efficient appliances. We're doing all the right things,"" said Padgoankar.

As data centers grow, so will the demands for more power from the utility, which helps explain why it is moving ahead with the natural gas pipeline.

Johnny Penrod says the utility aims to produce enough power for everyone.

""Basically to keep people safe. Keeping the lights on is so important for everybody,"" said Penrod.

Including the data centers.

One thematic fund to consider is the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT ).
Furthermore, BATT tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index, which includes global exposure for added diversification and to capture these worldwide trends.
“As renewable energy production becomes more widespread, the need for efficient storage systems to manage this energy and stabilize the grid grows,” the Data Bridge report said.
“Government support could prove decisive in determining which projects move forward and, therefore, to what extent U.S. production grows,” the Dallas Fed said.","With this year’s AI-fueled mega cap rally showing signs of potential frothiness, investors might be wondering how to recharge their growth allocation. One thematic fund to consider is the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT ).

Under the proverbial hood, BATT is comprised of companies poised to capture future growth from three sub-sectors: battery storage solutions, battery metals & materials, and electric vehicles (EVs). The AI rally confirmed that the world will require copious amounts of electricity in order to continue running. In turn, this will require the capability to maintain an electrical charge, which lithium-ion technology is capable of doing. Hence, the growth opportunity inherent in BATT.

Furthermore, BATT tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index, which includes global exposure for added diversification and to capture these worldwide trends. As of September 30, about 50% of the country allocation is split among China and the U.S. However, it includes exposure to countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and others.

Third party research firm Data Bridge forecasts that the global lithium-ion battery market could reach a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% in just seven years. The demand for renewable energy can certainly drive this growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted four years earlier that global renewable energy capacity is expected to grow 60% by the year 2026.

“As renewable energy production becomes more widespread, the need for efficient storage systems to manage this energy and stabilize the grid grows,” the Data Bridge report said.

Adoption of EV usage has been initially slow. However, government incentives could help bring more buyers to EVs in the U.S. Globally, the adoption is already materializing at a rapid clip.

Data from Rho Motion revealed that $2.1 million EVs were sold during the month of September. That represents a monthly record. From January to September 2025, global EV sales have risen by 26% to 14.7 million units. Europe is seeing the largest growth year-to-date, with China coming in second.

“Global EV sales topped 2 million units in a single month for the first time, driven by record-breaking demand across major markets,” said Rho Motion’s data manager Charles Lester. “The US surged ahead as buyers raced to claim expiring tax credits, the UK hit new highs on the back of fresh registration plates and the Electric Car Grant, and South Korea set records thanks to Tesla, Hyundai, Kia, and rising BYD imports. Year to date, EV sales have reached 14.7 million – up 26%.”

Every growth opportunity doesn’t come without its set of challenges. For lithium, macroeconomic headwinds include price volatility amid high supply, geopolitical pressures, and governmental policy changes. That latter, however, could be a prime factor in setting lithium prices on an upward trajectory.

As the Dallas Fed pointed out, one of the catalysts that could provide further tailwinds for lithium prices is the ongoing backing of the U.S. government. With a desire to reduce reliance on nations such as China and bolster domestic production, governmental policies that support mining will be crucial for the industry.

“Government support could prove decisive in determining which projects move forward and, therefore, to what extent U.S. production grows,” the Dallas Fed said. “Indeed, federal interest in securing domestic production has already shaped the industry through billions in subsidized loans and grants and with policies intended to boost demand for domestically produced lithium.”

This makes BATT an ideal buy-and-hold opportunity that could play out in its favor in the long run.

A new study from researchers at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health; UNC Environment, Energy and Ecology Program; and University of Pristina in Kosovo is shedding light on a hidden challenge facing Southeast Europe’s clean energy transition: fragile, coal-dependent power grids.

The paper, published in Environmental Research: Energy, assesses the power grids of 12 countries in Southeast Europe to gauge their preparedness for a shift to renewable energy and their resilience against more frequent adverse weather events.

The findings show that nations that are most reliant on coal are also the most vulnerable to disruptions as they bring more wind and solar energy online.

The study was led by Serkan Sargin, a doctoral student in the Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program at UNC-Chapel Hill, with co-authors Majlinda Daci, a professor at the University of Prishtina, and Noah Kittner, PhD, an associate professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the Gillings School.

Together, the team built a new framework to evaluate “grid vulnerability,” using eight indicators ranging from reliability and storage capacity to renewable diversity and interconnection strength.

“This is a new study to identify vulnerabilities exposed by reliance on single-dominant electricity generation sources,” said Kittner. “Though focused on Southeast Europe, there are lessons for North Carolina.”

Their results paint a clear picture: Kosovo’s grid ranked as the most vulnerable in the region, followed closely by Albania. Kosovo’s dependence on coal — about 88% of its electricity generation — makes it particularly inflexible and exposed to failures.

Albania, on the other hand, produces all its power from hydropower, but its centralized system lacks diversity and storage, leaving it just as fragile when droughts or shortages hit. By contrast, Croatia and Turkey scored lowest in vulnerability, as a result of stronger infrastructure and a broader mix of renewable energy.

The researchers emphasize that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Each country has different weak spots, meaning investments should focus on where they’ll make the biggest impact — whether that’s expanding storage, improving forecasting, decentralizing generation or strengthening cross-border connections.

“Most people are familiar with extreme weather events impacting grid reliability, but our response to natural disasters is also augmented by the infrastructure available to respond to dynamic changes in the environment,” said Kittner.

First, this boxy truck being manufactured by Oshkosh Corp.'s Oshkosh Defense unit has to replace a fleet of vehicular fossils. These Long Life Vehicles (LLVs) built by Grumman from 1986 to 1994 with a 24-year planned lifespan continue to ply USPS routes despite their lack of such conveniences as air bags and air conditioning.

Second, the Biden administration's use of Inflation Reduction Act funding to convert three-quarters of NGDV orders to a battery-electric version means this truck must also bring the Postal Service into the EV era as support for that swings from Biden's sometimes-ineffectual support to President Trump's ignorant contempt for them.

But the vehicle that's supposed to deliver the USPS into modern mobility has itself fallen behind schedule: Last December, the Washington Post reported that the service had only received 93 of the planned 3,000+ NGDVs. Until a visit to Oshkosh's offices here in mid-October, I'd only seen NGDVs in exhibits at CES and parked in front of the USPS' Washington headquarters.

Face to Face With the Duckface Truck

Whenever an NGDV does make its way to your neighborhood, you won't mistake it for any other vehicle. Its low hood runs into a steep cliff of a windscreen that then meets a slab-sided, rhombus-shaped body. This ungainly appearance has earned descriptions like ""duckface"" or ""duck truck."" Letter carriers on Reddit's r/USPS forum seem to prefer ""platypus.""

This NGDV looks that way for a reason: so USPS employees can stand up in the back as they sort mail and packages. E-commerce shipments from Amazon and other retailers now constitute a large chunk of the service's business and have its trucks rolling on Sundays.

""This is transforming the United States Postal Service because it allows them to participate fully in e-commerce delivery,"" Oshkosh President and CEO John Pfeifer said at a meeting with journalists during our visit.

Stepping into an early-build electric NGDV parked outside revealed an interior with six large shelves and plenty of room to step back and forth between them. The right-hand driver's seat up front, meanwhile, was positioned low enough to make it easy to lean out the enormous window to the side and reach into a mailbox placed next to it.

The NGDV doesn't look like any other EV, but the model I took for a brief drive around Oshkosh's parking lot drove a bit like one, affording some of the pleasing instant pickup that I've come to expect from EVs while also yielding a tight turning circle.

It charges its 94 kWh lithium-ion battery via a standard CCS port; on the test vehicle, it was next to the right headlight but on production vehicles is at the back-left corner. That pack has a 10-year design life, which Oshkosh CTO Jay Iyengar suggested would result in a substantial upgrade whenever the pack gets replaced: ""We do see battery technology and energy density improving very rapidly,"" he said.

Visibility through all those windows seemed great, with a backup camera to help with reversing (meaning, it helped me to avoid running into that mailbox). The touch-screen-free dashboard did not feature a radio but included Bluetooth audio for phone calls and a cupholder, another thing absent from LLVs.

Additional exterior-facing cameras and sensors help with collision avoidance. Pfeifer suggested they could also generate valuable civic insights once the NGDV is rolling down every street in America: ""It'll be able to pick up intelligence about city streets and parking conditions and all sorts of things.""

Still Plugging Away

Oshkosh has delivered ""thousands"" of NGDVs so far, and is now rapidly ramping up NGDV production at a Spartanburg, South Carolina, factory to reach 16,000 to 20,000 vehicles a year.

USPS spokeswoman Kim Frum said the agency has received more than 2,500, including 500-plus battery-electric versions, out of a total order for 51,500, with 35,000 electric.

Its initial 2022 contract covered 50,000 mostly gas NGDVs, with a $2.98 billion cost. The agency now plans to spend $9.6 billion on vehicle modernization, including $3 billion in IRA funding to cover EV editions of those and other trucks, but hasn't published a revised budget for NGDV procurement. Pfeifer attributed the slow start to the USPS pivoting to a mostly EV order in late 2022 plus ""a few normal ramp-up issues that slowed us down.""

Reports from the USPS Inspector General in October 2024 and August 2025 faulted the agency for ordering a custom design via a prolonged sourcing process instead of picking one partner—in contrast to Amazon's partnership with Rivian to build EV delivery vans—and also cited such subsequent issues as supply-chain and testing holdups.

The electric version also suffered from a belated buildout of charging stations marred by procurement and permitting complications, which have tripped up private companies, too.

In June, a new threat emerged: Republicans in Congress added a provision to the massive budget-reconciliation bill that would have auctioned off the entire USPS EV fleet—both electric NGDVs and thousands of Ford E-Transit vans—and even its charging infrastructure.

""The language they tried to put in was very damaging,"" Pfeifer said, calling it a surprise to many other Republican representatives who ""thought it was crazy.""

Soon after, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that provision out of bounds for a budget measure. That language vanished from the bill that Trump signed in July, but it did wipe out tax credits for buying EVs.

Putting Electrification to Work Where It Works Best

Pfeifer said Oshkosh's lobbyists made a case for letting the USPS proceed with EVs where they made business sense, and he stuck to that line during the visit.

""We're not doing electrification for the sake of electrification, we're doing electrification when it matters because there's an economic case for it or when customers demand it,"" he said.

Mail trucks represent an especially compelling case for electric power because of their driving pattern: ""stop-start-stop-start-stop-start,"" as Pfeifer put it, saying this truck can often run for two days on a charge. Iyengar's assessment of electrification for USPS delivery: ""No better application.""

EVs' efficiency in that service scenario also explains why electrification is good for other vehicles that make frequent stops, such as school buses and garbage trucks. Oshkosh's driving demo included one example of the latter, a battery-electric Volterra ZSL model from its McNeilus subsidiary that I also got to take for a spin around the parking lot.

It smoothly moved out, which is not something I would have expected from a vehicle that weighs 39,500 pounds empty. The lack of a roaring diesel engine made this the quietest garbage truck I have ever driven, but also the only garbage truck I have ever driven.

Oshkosh also makes fire trucks, and for those it's opting for plug-in hybrid propulsion, with diesel as a backup to electric for long service calls. A Volterra fire truck that I drove for a couple of laps around a training facility next to the airport in nearby Appleton booted up as an EV but could be switched to the diesel engine with a button in the cab.

That pumper and the sleek airport firefighting vehicle next to it offered one other advantage over diesel-powered trucks: Firefighters can back them into a garage under electric power for a pollution-free return, granting their colleagues cleaner air after a day that may not have allowed much of it.

Across his work at NSI and NTI, Matzkin-Bridger focuses on the intersection of clean energy and security, specifically exploring fuel cycle choices that enable secure nuclear energy scaling.

Fresh off two presidential summits in just over two months, the United States and South Korea are approaching a pivotal moment in their bilateral relationship: the chance to define the next generation of clean, responsible, and globally competitive energy. With many countries currently betting big on nuclear energy, those who move fastest from theoretical plans to working plants that are safe, secure, and cost efficient will come out on top. The most direct route to success is through focusing resources on proven, innovative technologies and resisting distractions that promise more than they deliver. One of the most consequential decisions countries will face is whether to take a costly detour into nuclear fuel reprocessing, a technology that has failed every promise it has made.

Often marketed as “recycling,” reprocessing theoretically turns nuclear waste into a resource, which sounds appealing. In practice, it’s a messy endeavor that creates new waste that is harder to manage and yields little to no actual recycling. The process involves chopping up radioactive spent nuclear fuel and attempting to extract reusable portions. But after all the expense and complexity that it entails, approximately 99 percent of the recovered material remains unused. Plus, instead of solving the waste problem, reprocessing multiplies it, producing additional highly radioactive waste streams that are harder and costlier to contain, and still require permanent disposal.

How has reprocessing and recycling worked in practice? Its record of failure is clear. France has reprocessed for decades, but billions of dollars later, they are only able to recycle about 1% of their ever-growing stockpile of reprocessed spent fuel. Meanwhile, the government is still working to site a permanent geologic repository needed for all of the highly radioactive waste they have produced along the way.

Japan’s reprocessing program has faced even greater challenges, with taxpayers paying tens of billions of dollars to construct a facility that has suffered 27 delays since breaking ground in 1993. More than 30 years later, it is still not operational. The United Kingdom also had an extended foray into reprocessing, but abandoned the program after decades of frustration and expense.

Reprocessing also introduces serious security risks because it produces a purified form of plutonium, a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Every variant of reprocessing, including so-called “pyroprocessing,” which has gained attention in both South Korea and the United States, produces weapons-usable materials. That’s why U.S. policy has discouraged the spread of reprocessing technology for decades. Reversing course now would not only waste money and slow nuclear energy scaling, but also undermine decades of global nonproliferation leadership.

Each attempt to revive reprocessing ends the same way: billions of dollars down the drain, technical failures abound, and security risks increase. At a time when the world needs clean energy fast, reprocessing would be no more than a costly distraction. It diverts capital, talent, and political attention from innovations that can strengthen supply chains, lower emissions, and create real jobs. The lessons from abroad could not be clearer: reprocessing is a dead end.

The future of nuclear energy lies in advanced reactors, modernized manufacturing, and efficient fuel supply chains that actually work. Fortunately, the United States and South Korea are already showing what smart, results-driven nuclear collaboration looks like. The recent strategic agreement signed between X-energy, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, Doosan, and Amazon is an excellent example of a partnership with expertise across the nuclear energy value chain that can deliver measurable progress in a matter of years, not decades. When stakeholders like this come together with high ambitions and practical plans, nuclear energy can scale responsibly, profitably, and fast.

Reprocessing belongs to a bygone era—not today’s nuclear energy resurgence. It has failed on cost, failed on security, and failed to deliver real benefits. The future belongs those who pick proven technologies that can be deployed now and rapidly scaled. By rejecting the reprocessing trap and doubling down on real nuclear innovation, Washington and Seoul can emerge as the leaders of this era of global nuclear energy expansion, delivering energy security, economic growth, and climate progress for decades to come.",https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_512223682-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 15:01:11.970414

Doris Matsui, Mike Quigley, and Paul Tonko and Vice Chairs Reps. Don Beyer, Suzanne Bonamici, Mike Levin, and Chellie Pingree, in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding EPA reverse course and maintain the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

“We write to inform you that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is violating clear congressional directives by proposing to end the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP),” the lawmakers wrote. “For more than a decade, this program has been the most important source of transparent and verifiable climate pollution data in the federal government, and the EPA has clear authority and obligation to continue maintaining it. Ending it would undermine lawful, evidence-based governance at precisely the moment when climate and energy challenges demand better information, not less.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), codified and established in a final rule by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009, requires large industrial facilities, fuel and industrial-gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites to monitor and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. In September 2025, the EPA proposed eliminating reporting obligations to the GHGRP, undermining transparency, accountability, and the data infrastructure that supports both climate policy and private-sector decision-making. If finalized, it would end mandatory emissions reporting for virtually all large industrial facilities after the 2024 reporting year and suspend or eliminate requirements for the remaining sectors until 2034.

Text of the letter can be found below. A copy of the letter can be found here.

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We write to inform you that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is violating clear congressional directives by proposing to end the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). For more than a decade, this program has been the most important source of transparent and verifiable climate pollution data in the federal government, and the EPA has clear authority and obligation to continue maintaining it. Ending it would undermine lawful, evidence-based governance at precisely the moment when climate and energy challenges demand better information, not less. The elimination of the GHGRP represents yet another example of the Trump Administration’s censorship of scientific data, while simultaneously threatening statutory obligations, jeopardizing taxpayers’ ability to claim certain energy tax credits, weakening American competitiveness in global markets, and depriving American businesses and investors of the credible data they rely on for decision-making. These short-sighted partisan decisions from the Trump Administration will have long-term implications for the economic prosperity and wellbeing of our businesses and the American people.

EPA has clear legal authority and an obligation to maintain the GHGRP. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 directed and funded EPA to promulgate and implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule covering “all sectors of the economy.” EPA did so relying on its broad authority under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, and has maintained the GHGRP since that time. The Agency’s new and unsupported view of its legal authority runs afoul of Congress’s clear direction and EPA’s own longstanding practice.

EPA’s proposal reflects a broad pattern of scientific data censorship under the Trump Administration as climate data is restricted, hidden, or defunded across the federal government. These actions have included funding cuts to researchers and scientists at the National Climate Assessment,the shutdown of the website for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the elimination of Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Future Risk Index,the discontinuation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database, the disabling of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, and significant censoring of hundreds of government websites related to climate change, among others. Suppressing scientific data does not make climate pollution or the systemic risk of climate change go away, it only blinds American policymakers, researchers, and the public to emerging threats and leaves our communities and families more vulnerable and defenseless.

The GHGRP is the backbone of the emissions verification needed to administer certain energy tax credits to American taxpayers. The GHGRP is indispensable to taxpayers in the energy industry, which rely on GHGRP data to verify eligibility for various federal tax incentives that support American industry. Without the GHGRP, even the American Petroleum Institute claims that major energy companies would lose the data infrastructure necessary to demonstrate compliance and claim these incentives, which would harm both American industry and our nation’s climate goals.

The GHGRP provides essential data that gives American manufacturing a competitive edge in rapidly innovating international markets. Eliminating this program would erode confidence in U.S. scientific data, drive up the cost of capital, and weaken American competitiveness just as the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other major economies adopt Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs) that reward verified low-emission manufacturing. For example, U.S.-produced low-emission steel and aluminum provide a clear market advantage relative to the high carbon intensity of materials produced in China, India, South Africa, and elsewhere. Without verifiable, trusted data like that provided by the GHGRP, the U.S. industry risks losing that global competitive advantage.

This data is equally vital as a business tool to investors and other stakeholders in the private sector, and is not easily replicable. EPA’s own website highlights GHGRP’s value as a business tool for cost-saving and risk management, noting that “data can be an important tool for businesses and other innovators to find cost- and fuel-saving efficiencies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”The Facility Level Information on GreenHouse gases Tool (FLIGHT) and other GHGRP datasets are widely used by companies, analysts, and investors to evaluate emissions performance and manage exposure to risks. Private companies also rely on the data to demonstrate the credibility of their emissions reduction strategies to investors and regulators. Ending federal reporting for greenhouse gases would shift the data-collection burden to the states or to less-equipped actors, fragmenting quality, raising costs, and eroding market trust.

Terminating the GHGRP would jeopardize key programs and reports that rely on this data to meet statutory obligations. In fact, EPA itself has long recognized the GHGRP’s importance to its own work, the work of other federal agencies, state and local programs, and to the private sector.

Given these concerns, we demand that EPA reverse course and maintain the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. To that end, we request that EPA outline how it will ensure continuity and quality of the data, tools, and public reporting functions that American businesses, investors, states, and federal agencies rely upon for compliance, planning, and risk management.

They emphasize that ignoring climate stress comes with mounting costs — something North Carolina communities are already experiencing after repeated hurricanes, inland flooding and accelerating coastal erosion.","A group of scientists has proposed a new way to detect climate threats long before they show up as flooded roads, heat-related illnesses or collapsing homes along the North Carolina coast.

The approach comes from researchers at the City University of New York’s Advanced Science Research Center, who published their findings this week in Cell Reports Sustainability. They describe a “Climate BioStress Sentinel System” that would track how climate change is stressing living things — from microbes to trees to people — and use those signals as early warnings of bigger problems ahead.

The concept is rooted in a simple idea: life reacts to climate pressure long before humans do. Plants change their chemistry during drought. Microbes shift as water warms. Animals behave differently during heat stress. Even hospital records can reveal early patterns of illness during extreme weather. The research argues that these biological “stress signatures” can act like canaries in the coal mine, offering clues about how climate change is unfolding across entire communities.

Charles Vörösmarty, the study’s lead author, said the goal is to give cities and states real-time tools to anticipate climate impacts rather than respond after they hit.

“Climate change is already affecting every level of life on Earth,” Vörösmarty said. “Those stress signals are measurable, and they can tell us where risks are building.”

Why it matters for North Carolina

North Carolina offers a clear example of the kinds of stress the system aims to track. Raleigh has endured record heat in recent summers, producing spikes in heat-related emergency visits. Eastern North Carolina is seeing more “sunny-day” flooding as sea levels rise. And on the Outer Banks, coastal erosion has pushed 27 homes into the ocean since 2020.

Under the proposed system, those impacts wouldn’t be tracked in isolation. Heat-stressed trees in Raleigh, algae blooms in the Neuse River, and shifting fish behavior along the coast would all be monitored alongside public-health data, weather trends and economic disruptions. Together, the signals would create a clearer picture of which communities are most vulnerable and how climate stress is spreading.

The study argues that cities are particularly sensitive because heat, air pollution, infrastructure gaps and social inequality compound one another. Raleigh’s rapid growth adds another layer, increasing demand on water, energy and emergency services.

How it could be used

The authors envision a system that blends environmental monitoring with public-health and social data. In an extreme heat event, for example, sensors could show which neighborhoods are warming fastest and whether local ecosystems are reacting. Hospitals could identify illness patterns, and mapping tools could show where resources are most needed.

Scientists say the technology already exists. What’s missing is coordination and investment. That gap reflects how most agencies still monitor climate impacts separately, which makes it harder to see how those stresses connect.

“Climate impacts don’t unfold one at a time,” Vörösmarty said. “They cascade.”

The researchers argue that detecting those cascades early could help cities direct cooling resources, prepare for flooding, manage water quality, and protect vulnerable residents.

The proposal is a framework, not a ready-made program. But the authors say the science is strong enough for cities to begin building pilot systems.

“It’s healthy, it’s beautiful, but it’s also necessary,” Grocoff said.","Veridian at County Farm places a strong emphasis on community connection and sustainability with front porches facing shared greenways with native landscaping.

Monthly energy bills for some homeowners have been a few cents or even negative.

Imagine opening your electric bill and finding only a few cents owed or nothing at all.

That’s everyday reality for some residents of Veridian at County Farm, a new Ann Arbor neighborhood that is reshaping what home energy use can look like.

Targeted to be one of the nation’s first solar-powered, net-zero and net-positive energy, fossil-fuel-free communities, Veridian is designed to produce its own power, eliminate the need for natural gas and reduce carbon emissions.

The project is a collaboration between Ann-Arbor based THRIVE Collaborative, and Avalon Housing, is being built on a 14-acre site that formerly housed the Washtenaw County Juvenile Detention Center.

“Sustainability shouldn’t be a style, it shouldn’t be a luxury item, it’s something that should fundability be a right for everybody to have,” says, Matt Grocoff, co-founder of THRIVE Collaborative.

Grocoff, who lives with his family in a 125-year-old Ann Arbor home certified as net-zero energy, said his household disconnected from natural gas over 15 years ago.

“My daughters have grown up in a home where they don’t know what a fossil fuel house is like,"" Grocoff said. ""Their car charges in the driveway. This is normal to them.”

When complete, Veridian at County Farms will include more than 110 residences, ranging from single-family homes and townhomes to studio units, and 11 short-term rentals in a restored farmhouse, according to Grocoff.

Each home will rely entirely on rooftop solar panels, geothermal wells and battery storage systems, meaning no natural gas lines connected to any buildings.

According to THRIVE Collaborative Sustainability Development Director Sara Hammerschmidt, about 40% of carbon emissions in the U.S. come from the building industry.

“Being intentional about the things going into these homes is something we are really paying attention to,” she said.

Patrick and Tammy Ferry were among Veridian’s first homeowners last year. The sustainability feature drew them in, and the energy bills keep them smiling.

Their most recent bill totaled just 20 cents. It was a little high, Patrick joked.

Every home includes solar arrays, energy recovery ventilators, heat pump water heaters, induction cooking, EV charging, Bosch electric appliances, Swedish triple-pane windows, and a compact Sonnen battery that stores excess solar power.

Steve Hathaway and his wife moved in last spring, and Steve described buying at Veridian as “getting a house with a cause,” noting that they appreciated both the sustainability mission and the appeal of new construction.

One month their electric bill was 47 cents. Another month it was negative 18 cents.

“Everybody is really social, and we’ve had a lot of fun,” Hathaway said, adding that the switch to fossil-fuel-free living has even changed their cooking habits. “Now I have to learn to grill on a pellet grill. I don’t want to let down the team.”

Home prices range from approximately $280,000 to $995,000, with detached single-family homes expected to start around $1.5 million.

The Michigan Public Service Commission has approved a pilot “virtual power plant” microgrid system for the neighborhood, allowing homes to share stored solar energy across the community, a model that could influence future development nationwide.

Veridian also places a strong emphasis on community connection. Front porches face shared greenways with native landscaping. Amenities, some completed, and others planned, include walking paths, rain gardens, a farm market, community gardens, edible landscaping, a bike-repair shed, shared e-bike and car-share options, outdoor gathering areas, and seasonal events at a restored 1840s barn.

Ultra-high-speed 10 Gbps internet is included in the homeowner’s association dues for market-rate buyers.

“We’ve gotten to know neighbors really well in ways we just haven’t experienced in other places,” Patrick Ferry said.

“The sustainability aspect is exciting, but even more than that, it feels like a small village within the city. It has this European vibe, built around a center courtyard. It’s a unique experience. One that we’re thoroughly enjoying.”

Using housing to address climate woes

Interest in net-zero housing is rising across the country. A 2022 report from the Energy and Environmental Building Alliance found a 190% increase in zero-energy home construction in the U.S. and Canada since 2020.

Supporters say neighborhoods like Veridian could play a role in reaching climate goals. Residential buildings account for more than a quarter of the nation’s fossil-fuel consumption, according to Grocoff. By electrifying home systems and generating power on site, Veridian aims to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions at the neighborhood level.

Buyers who purchase before December 2025 may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to 30% on solar, battery storage and geothermal systems.

“It’s healthy, it’s beautiful, but it’s also necessary,” Grocoff said. “We want to be an example, to where every neighborhood in the nation is run with all electric and powered with renewable energy.”

For operators, investors, and policymakers, this program represents unprecedented opportunity to participate in America's offshore energy development whilst contributing to long-term energy security objectives.","Understanding the Strategic Framework Behind America's Most Ambitious Offshore Energy Initiative

The Trump administration's comprehensive offshore leasing program establishes a fundamentally new approach to U.S. energy development, centered on competitive fiscal terms designed to maximise industry engagement while generating substantial federal revenues. This historic initiative reduces the federal royalty rate to 12.5% from the previous 18.75%, representing a 33% decrease in fiscal burden that positions American waters competitively against international offshore regions.

The program operates under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act framework, providing congressional-level certainty that extends through 2040. Furthermore, this legislative foundation differs significantly from previous discretionary leasing arrangements, offering operators the regulatory predictability essential for multi-billion dollar deepwater investments that typically require 7-10 years from lease acquisition to first production.

What Makes This Gulf of Mexico Auction Historically Significant?

The December 10, 2025 lease sale represents the largest Gulf of Mexico offering in nearly a decade, encompassing 80 million acres across 14,000 individual tracts spanning federal waters from 3 to 231 miles offshore. This unprecedented scale dwarfs recent offerings and establishes the foundation for a 30-auction program scheduled through 2040.

Critical Auction Parameters:

Total Coverage: 80 million acres across multiple water depths

Tract Availability: 14,000 individual parcels

Minimum Bid Requirement: $25 per acre

Geographic Range: Shallow waters to ultra-deepwater zones

Program Duration: 15-year timeline with predictable scheduling

The sale includes strategically located areas adjacent to major operational projects, including Shell's Whale development and Chevron's Anchor project in Alaminos Canyon and Green Canyon blocks. This proximity to existing infrastructure provides operators with immediate access to established pipeline networks and processing facilities, significantly reducing development costs and timeframes.

Historical context reveals that individual Gulf lease sales have generated revenues ranging from $100 million to $9.5 billion, depending on oil price environments and industry demand. The 2022 Gulf Lease Sale 257 generated approximately $312.7 million from 89 leased tracts, while the 2008 pre-Deepwater Horizon sale reached $3.1 billion during more favourable market conditions.

The American Petroleum Institute characterised the reduced royalty rate as a competitive step designed to revive investment in deepwater exploration that had been hindered by previous fiscal terms. In addition, industry participants recognise that the fixed leasing calendar addresses critical requirements for long-cycle projects requiring regulatory predictability over multi-decade investment horizons.

How Does the 12.5% Royalty Rate Compare Globally?

The Trump 12.5% gulf oil auction establishes highly competitive fiscal terms when analysed against international offshore jurisdictions. The statutory minimum rate provides operators with predictable baseline costs whilst maintaining federal revenue generation through complementary taxation mechanisms.

International Fiscal Comparison:

Offshore Region Primary Royalty Additional Taxes Combined Effective Rate U.S. Gulf of Mexico 12.5% Federal/state corporate tax 21-25% Norway North Sea 20-28% 78% petroleum tax 60-70% UK North Sea 10-40% (tiered) Ring fence corporation tax 50-65% Brazil Pre-salt 5-15% (tiered) Special participation fees 35-50% Australia Commonwealth 10-12.5% Petroleum resource rent tax 45-50% Canada Federal 5-12.5% Income and resource taxes 35-45%

The U.S. Gulf's combined fiscal burden of approximately 21-25% positions American waters competitively against mature North Sea basins whilst remaining higher than Brazil's pre-salt developments, which have attracted aggressive international bidding through lower initial fiscal take. This competitive positioning addresses key concerns from international E&P companies that had shifted capital allocation toward South American developments offering more favourable terms.

Norway's 60-70% combined effective rate reflects the country's mature fiscal regime designed to capture maximum resource rents from established high-productivity fields. However, the UK's tiered system ranges from 50-65% depending on field characteristics and production levels. Australia's petroleum resource rent tax adds significant fiscal burden to the base royalty rate, creating combined effective rates of 45-50%.

Recent prolific discoveries in Guyana (Liza, Payara, Yellowtail fields) have attracted major operator investment partly due to significantly lower royalty rates of 2% on shallow-water developments, demonstrating competitive pressure the U.S. Gulf faces from alternative geographies offering more favourable terms.

Which Major Operators Are Positioning for Maximum Impact?

Industry intelligence indicates that established Gulf producers have strategically expanded capital allocation in anticipation of the new leasing framework. Chevron, Shell, and BP have already increased Gulf capital budgets according to industry reports, positioning themselves to capitalise on expanded opportunities under the competitive fiscal structure.

Strategic Positioning by Operator Category:

Integrated Majors (ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP):

Access to multi-billion dollar project funding capabilities

Established deepwater technical expertise and operational experience

Existing offshore infrastructure ownership and pipeline networks

Ability to cross-subsidise exploration from global operations

Established regulatory relationships and permitting experience

Independent Producers (Murphy Oil, Occidental, focused E&P companies):

Lower cost structure enabling smaller, marginal fields to achieve economic viability

Capability to monetise less-explored acreage rejected by major operators

Reduced exploration overhead through focused geographic concentration

Potential capital constraints for ultra-deepwater development requirements

International Players (Equinor, TotalEnergies, Eni, Woodside):

Access to international capital and advanced deepwater experience

Technical expertise from other global basins (North Sea, West Africa, Brazil)

Opportunities for joint venture arrangements with domestic operators

May require infrastructure partnerships due to limited U.S. Gulf presence

Service Sector Expansion Opportunities:

Drilling Services: Increased demand for floating rigs and specialised equipment

Well Completion: Enhanced requirements for deepwater completion technologies

Subsea Engineering: Installation and maintenance of underwater infrastructure

Project Management: Consulting and technical services for complex developments

Current Gulf of Mexico production accounts for approximately 15% of total U.S. crude output, with deepwater projects representing some of the nation's most technically advanced and productive operations. Furthermore, the expanded leasing program aims to maintain and potentially increase this contribution over the coming decades.

Shell's Whale deepwater project serves as a modern benchmark for development in similar lease areas, demonstrating technical feasibility and operational excellence in Alaminos Canyon blocks. Chevron's Anchor project in Green Canyon provides another operational model for large-scale deepwater development, showcasing scalability and capital efficiency for future developments.

What Economic Impact Will This Generate for Federal and State Revenues?

The 30-auction program spanning 15 years creates substantial revenue generation potential for federal and state governments through the established Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) framework. Historical auction performance provides baseline projections for long-term revenue streams.

Revenue Distribution Structure:

Revenue Recipient Allocation Percentage Primary Use Federal Treasury Primary recipient General federal revenue Gulf Coast States 37.5% of revenues Coastal restoration, infrastructure Land and Water Conservation Fund Dedicated allocation Conservation and land acquisition Historic Preservation Fund Specified contribution Historic site preservation

Gulf Coast State Benefits

The four Gulf Coast states (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama) receive direct financial support through the 37.5% GOMESA allocation, providing dedicated funding for:

Coastal Restoration Projects: Critical infrastructure protection against subsidence and sea-level change

Hurricane Preparedness: Disaster resilience infrastructure investment

Economic Development: Regional infrastructure and industrial support

Environmental Protection: Marine habitat conservation and restoration

Louisiana historically receives the largest share due to production proximity and extensive coastal zone management responsibilities. The state utilises GOMESA revenues for comprehensive coastal restoration projects addressing land loss and environmental degradation caused by historical resource extraction activities.

Revenue Mechanics and Timeline

Operators pay minimum bid amounts of $25 per acre plus annual rental fees during non-producing lease periods, which typically extend 5-10 years through exploration and development phases. Upon achieving production, operators transition to royalty-based payments at 12.5% of production value, creating long-term revenue streams extending decades beyond initial lease acquisition.

The fixed 30-auction schedule provides Treasury with predictable revenue streams over the 15-year horizon, enabling long-term federal budget planning and reducing revenue volatility caused by ad-hoc leasing decisions. This predictability supports both immediate fiscal planning and strategic infrastructure investment across federal and state levels.

How Will This Affect U.S. Oil Production and Energy Independence?

The expanded Gulf leasing program directly supports U.S. energy security objectives by maintaining and potentially expanding domestic offshore production capacity. Current Gulf operations contribute approximately 15% of total U.S. crude oil output, with deepwater projects representing the most technically advanced and productive domestic operations.

Production Sustainability Framework:

Reservoir Quality and Productivity:

Gulf formations offer exceptional high-productivity potential

Proven deepwater reserves support long-term development

Advanced recovery technologies maximise field economics

Multiple pay zones provide development flexibility

Infrastructure Advantages:

Established pipeline networks reduce development costs

Existing processing facilities support rapid production startup

Mature service sector provides technical expertise

Strategic geographic positioning for export markets

Development Timeline Considerations

Deepwater projects typically require 7-10 years from lease acquisition to first production, suggesting meaningful production impact from the current program beginning 2032-2035 for early-awarded leases. The 2025-2040 program timeline aligns with industry development cycles, ensuring continuous lease availability throughout extended project lifecycles.

Strategic Energy Security Benefits:

Increased domestic production capacity provides strategic flexibility in international energy relationships and reduces import dependency. Recent agreements with China and South Korea for increased U.S. energy purchases demonstrate how domestic production capacity translates into international market advantages and enhanced energy diplomacy options.

The predictable leasing framework supports investment stability that extends beyond immediate development opportunities, enabling strategic positioning for future energy market developments. As global energy markets continue evolving, domestic production capacity provides supply chain resilience and price stability buffers.

What Are the Environmental and Regulatory Considerations?

The Trump 12.5% gulf oil auction operates within comprehensive environmental frameworks whilst streamlining approval processes for qualified operators. All lease areas undergo rigorous environmental analysis, with sensitive marine habitats and protected areas excluded from offerings.

Environmental Safeguard Implementation:

Protected Area Exclusions:

Sensitive marine habitats remain protected from development

Marine protected areas excluded from lease offerings

Critical species breeding grounds receive special protection

Coral reef systems and essential fish habitat protections maintained

Operational Environmental Requirements:

Advanced blowout prevention systems mandatory for all operations

Real-time environmental monitoring protocols required

Seasonal restrictions protect marine mammal migration patterns

Enhanced safety systems exceed historical operational standards

Strategic Importance: Arctic resource development and geopolitical positioning

The Alaska component addresses both domestic energy security and geopolitical considerations, particularly regarding Arctic resource competition with other nations. The consistent 12.5% royalty rate across both regions provides operators with fiscal certainty and enables resource allocation decisions based on geological and logistical factors rather than regulatory differences.

Regional Economic Integration

Alaska's offshore development supports state economic diversification whilst providing operators with additional resource base options. The Cook Inlet program represents a reversal from previous administration restrictions and reinforces Alaska's strategic role as both an energy hub and Arctic gateway.

The dual-region approach creates operational synergies for companies active in both basins, enabling technology transfer and operational expertise sharing between Gulf and Alaska operations. This geographic diversification reduces operator risk whilst maximising domestic resource development potential.

What Investment Opportunities Does This Create?

The announcement comes on the heels of an election cycle where soaring energy costs were a defining issue for voters, including in Georgia. In an upset last week, Democrats made history by flipping two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission. Customers of the largest utility provider in Georgia have seen their bills increase by $518 a year over the last two years. Trump and Republicans’ war on clean energy is only making the problem worse by taking cheaper, cleaner energy off the grid – and voters are holding them accountable for it at the polls.

Climate Power’s October Energy Crisis Snapshot report shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office. Meanwhile, soaring energy costs dominated the political conversation in Tuesday’s elections, offering Democrats a roadmap for the 2026 midterms.

Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass issued the following statement:

“Donald Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half, but less than a year into his presidency, Americans are facing soaring utility bills and a constant drumbeat of factory closures. His reckless energy policies are putting local jobs on the line and hiking utility bills at the same time that Republicans in Congress are jacking up costs for working families by refusing to lower health care costs. Trump and Republicans are making the affordability crisis worse, and last week’s election results show that Americans have had enough.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country:

A new report from Climate Power shows that Trump’s energy crisis has resulted in over 158,000 lost or stalled jobs in the clean energy sector, with nearly half from grants eliminated during the government shutdown. With rising energy demand driven by AI and extreme heat, gutting clean energy is already taking critical production offline and increasing costs for consumers.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, VA facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an EV battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump is using the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

Trump’s federal energy policies contributed to battery startup, Natron Energy, shutting down and canceling its planned $1.4 billion factory in Eastern North Carolina, which would have created 1,000 jobs.

That’s roughly 14,500 or 28.5% more than at the beginning of 2025 (which saw almost 51,000 stalls).

The expansion of EV charging infrastructure is not slowing down, and progresses at an average rate of about 45 new stalls per day.

There are more stalls, more stations, and the stations themselves are becoming larger than ever. All this is combined with an ongoing increase in average power, improved reliability, and accessibility between various EVs and networks.

65,000+ Ports and 14,500* Locations

According to the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), as of November 10, 2025, there were 65,447 public DC fast-charging ports (aka stalls), including all connector standards. This number includes DC fast-charging ports that are temporarily unavailable (778 ports, or 1.2%).

The number of public DC fast-charging stalls in the US increased by over 5,000 since late July, and by roughly 14,500 since January 1, 2025. We are now heading toward 70,000, which should be achievable by the end of Q1 2026.

*An EV charging port provides power to charge only one vehicle at a time, even though it may have multiple connectors. The number of individual connectors might be similar to or higher than the number of ports.

The temporarily unavailable points are “out of service or offline due to maintenance and plan to open again in the future”.

The numbers may differ slightly depending on the exact date of access, so please treat them as a close estimate.

The number of stations (locations) is estimated at 14,448, including 377 (2.6%) that are temporarily unavailable. However, this raw number may be inflated and somewhat misleading. That’s because some chargers are counted as separate stations, even when they are located next to each other.

The number of stations increased by over 2,000 during the past 11 months. The data indicates that, on average, several new locations go online every day.

On average, a DC fast-charging station has 4.5 stalls (compared to 4.1 at the beginning of the year).

One of the most positive pieces of news is that the share of charging ports and charging stations marked as temporarily unavailable has decreased noticeably over the past 11 months.

Number of DC Charging Points by States

According to the AFDC, the top five states with the highest number of DC fast-charging ports are:

California (16,542)

Texas (4,426)

Florida (4,034)

New York (2,771)

Georgia (1,909)

Together, they represent over 45% of all chargers (over 29,682 ports) in the country. Alaska remains at the other end of the list with just 66 ports (up from 52 at the end of July 2026).

Top DC Charging Networks by Ports

The top five largest DC fast-charging networks, based on the number of charging ports, represent over 77% of the total number of available ports. The remaining 22% belong to other networks or are non-networked points.

The top five’s market share is decreasing (by several percentage points already this year), which indicates that other networks are installing chargers at a faster rate.

The Tesla Supercharging network remains the largest network with over 34,700 stalls and a 53.0% share (down from 57% at the beginning of 2025). More than two-thirds of all Tesla Superchargers in North America are open to non-Tesla EVs (mostly to Tesla’s NACS partners or to all compatible EVs through built-in NACS-to-CCS1 adapters, aka Magic Dock).

The next three networks — Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint* — are relatively similar in size, with between 4,375 and 5,228 charging ports. Blink is fifth, but far behind with fewer than 1,900 charging stalls, and closely followed by EV Connect.

*An important note to remember is that ChargePoint does not own the charging points (aside from a small number) because they are actually owned by thousands of individual charger owners or companies.

The top DC fast-charging networks are as follows:

Tesla Superchargers: 34,717 ports (a 53.0% share)

Electrify America: 5,228 ports (an 8.0% share)

EVgo: 4,575 ports (a 7.0% share)

ChargePoint: 4,375 ports (a 6.7% share)

Blink: 1,875 ports (a 2.9% share)

Top 5 networks: 50,770 ports (a 77.6% share)

other: 14,677 ports (a 22.4% share)

The all-new Ionna charging network is expanding rapidly. As of today, it has some 40 sites and almost 400 stalls. Meanwhile, Walmart recently reached 10 sites.

As a side note, we must add that the Tesla Supercharging network has only NACS (SAE J3400) plugs, while the other networks use mostly CCS1, with the addition of some CHAdeMO and a small but growing number of NACS (SAE J3400).

Canada

Canada noted a similar rate of expansion. According to the AFDC, the number of public DC fast-charging ports increased to 7,846 (a rise of over 1,700, or 28%, compared to mid-December 2024). Roughly 1.1% ports (88) were considered temporarily unavailable.

The number of stations in Canada increased to 2,647 (by over 21% in less than a year). However, the number of stations might be noticeably inflated. Roughly 2.0% of the stations are temporarily unavailable.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/64637-Hyundai-NACS.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 15:02:09.457722

Ministers Dabrusin and Hodgson outline Budget 2025's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy

TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2025 /CNW/ - Global trade upheavals, rapid technological change, and the clean transition are reshaping the world economy. Canada's economic strategy must adapt--and fast. Budget 2025: Canada Strong is our plan to make our economy stronger, more self-sufficient, and resilient to global shocks. It will catalyse over $1 trillion in investment over the next five years, driving growth in nuclear, hydro, wind, energy storage, and grid infrastructure to make Canada a leader in the low-carbon economy.

Investing in a clean future is both a moral imperative and the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. As the world moves toward net zero, Canada's climate competitiveness will define Canada's leadership on the world stage. By 2035, the clean technology market will triple, and demand for clean electricity will double. To compete, Canada's investment must keep pace.

Today, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, outlined the government's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy at the Pearl Street Energy Centre in Toronto. The strategy, which positions Canada to compete and win in this new global landscape, is anchored by three pillars:

Boosting investment through Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits to make it more affordable for Canadian industries to transition to clean energy, modernise electricity grids, expand renewables, increase energy storage, and strengthen power connections across provinces. Our plan will:

Implement the 15%Clean Electricity investment tax credit and remove the conditions imposed on provincial and territorial governments for their Crown corporations to be eligible.

Expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the 30% Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit.

Supercharge affordable, net-zero energy projects with the following tax credits:

Clean Technology, expanding eligibility to include systems that produce electricity, heat, or both electricity and heat from waste biomass and changed the eligibility requirements for small nuclear energy.

Clean Hydrogen, introducing availability for hydrogen produced from methane pyrolysis under this tax credit.

Extend the full value of the Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage investment tax credit by five years through 2035.

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing to reduce emissions and provide long-term certainty for businesses and investors. Effective industrial carbon markets are integral to driving investment in clean growth and emissions reductions. We are committing to improving carbon markets across the country to provide the confidence and predictability that industry requires to invest and grow. Our plan will:

Engage with provinces and territories to develop a post-2030 carbon pricing trajectory. We will set an industrial carbon price trajectory that supports net-zero by 2050, giving businesses the confidence they need to make long-term investments in climate competitiveness.

Engage with provincial and territorial governments on improvements to the federal benchmark. This process will ensure pricing systems across the country are working effectively and enable the implementation of a strengthened benchmark. Additionally, we will explore opportunities to harmonise or link carbon credit markets.

Apply the federal backstop whenever a provincial or territorial system falls below a strengthened federal benchmark, to ensure a stringent price signal and level playing field across the country.

The Canada Growth Fund will continue to issue contracts for difference as a means of further improving future carbon price certainty for investors making large, long-duration capital investments.

Clarifying greenhouse gas regulations, including finalizing enhanced methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. By tightening these regulations, we will significantly reduce emissions across Canada, while providing clarity and predictability for industry. We will also finalise new methane regulations for landfills. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases--80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period--and one of the easiest to reduce.

In parallel, Canada's new government is investing in the critical minerals that will power the clean energy future. Budget 2025 commits over $2 billion in new investments over five years to accelerate production, create thousands of new-high-paying careers, and strengthen our position in this strategic global market. Through a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, the First and Last Mile Fund, and expanded eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we will bring more Canadian critical minerals projects into production and unlock the next generation of clean technology supply chains, from electric vehicles to advanced manufacturing.

Combined, these measures form a bold new strategy to supercharge Canadian competitiveness in the global transformation to clean energy. By investing in our people, technologies, and natural resources, we can strengthen our economy today, build resilience for the future, and position Canada as a clean energy superpower in a net-zero world.

Quotes

""Canada must act with urgency, unity, and determination. At this critical moment, we have a choice: lead--and seize the opportunities of the energy transition--or get left behind. With the Climate Competitiveness Strategy, we are positioning climate action and economic growth as inseparable, aiming to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more competitive Canada for decades to come. This will help us take action in a way that prioritises affordability for Canadians and strengthens our economy.""

- The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

""Canada is securing our place as a global energy and resource superpower--and by doing it responsibly and sustainably, we are securing wins for Canadians and the planet. We know what a strong economy and clean environment require, and our Strategy provides it: clarity and predictability that drives innovation, attracts investment, and mobilises capital. We have a responsibility to protect Canada's environment and economy for generations to come, and that delivery starts now.""

- The Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources

Quick facts

The Strategy outlines clear rules that will cut emissions, drive innovation, and attract investment. Public and private capital will be mobilised toward a net-zero economy, establishing sustainable investment guidelines, a Sustainable Bonds Framework, improving climate disclosures in collaboration with provinces and territories, and amending anti-greenwashing provisions to improve investor certainty.

Our government's commitment to a low-carbon economy is reflected in the work of the Major Projects Office (MPO). One of the criteria for designation as a Project of National Interest is how a project will contribute to clean growth and to Canada's objectives with respect to climate change. This office will continue to evaluate projects for fast-tracking based in part on their contributions to clean growth and Canada's climate goals.

The first unit of the Darlington New Nuclear Project will provide reliable and affordable clean power to 300,000 homes, and position Canada as a global leader in the deployment of this technology worldwide.

Expected to be the first net-zero copper project in Canada, the McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project will strengthen Canada's supply of critical minerals, creating hundreds of new careers across local economies.

The Red Chris Mine expansion will increase Canada's annual copper production by over 15% and reduce the mine's greenhouse gas emissions by over 70% when operational.

Wind West could be Canada's first offshore wind development and will set the scale, direction and trajectory for future growth. Unlocking 5,000 MW in the first phase could produce 24 TWh of clean energy every year and drive billions in new investment and economic activity across Canada, led by the private sector. This Eastern Energy Partnership could include important projects like interties between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, transmission cables between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick as well as Quebec's and Newfoundland and Labrador's further development of Churchill Falls and Gull Island.

Alto High-Speed Railway, spanning approximately 1,000 km from Toronto to Quebec City and reaching speeds of up to 300km/hour to cut travel times in half and connect close to half of Canada's population. This project targets 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings, the creation of 51,000 new jobs and 63,000 new housing units along its route.

This approach also extends beyond those industries. In homebuilding, factory-built homes will give more Canadians an affordable place to live while cutting emissions by over 20% compared with traditional construction methods.

Carbon pricing systems are a major component of Canada's clean investment landscape. Seventy major decarbonization projects across the country, collectively worth over $57 billion, are supported by industrial carbon markets. Around $4.3 billion in annual clean energy investment is linked directly to the existence of carbon pricing for large industrial emitters.

Budget 2025 commits to implementing the 15 % Clean Electricity investment tax credit, which will be available once legislation is passed and guidance finalized. This can cover 15 % of capital costs of eligible investment in equipment related to low-emitting electricity generation, electricity storage and interjurisdictional transmission projects.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

The government will provide transparent updates on progress and introduce new metrics to measure how businesses and households are cutting emissions, how the clean economy is expanding, and how Canadian exports are tracking to achieve world-leading emissions intensity.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like wildfires, drought, floods, and more severe storms. Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5 to 6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says that extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses in 2024.

According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), public oyster seed grounds in St. Bernard and Terrebonne parishes were opened on November 3, throwing open the doors for fishermen to harvest marketable oysters under a strict permit and reporting system.

The opening was followed closely by a joint patrol blitz on November 3 and 4, orchestrated by the LDWF along with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The patrols served a dual purpose; on one hand, LDWF agents boarded vessels to ensure fishermen adhered to local fishing regulations, and on the other, federal officers checked for compliance with immigration laws amongst the crew.

Violations were not sparingly found; LDWF agents handed out a handful of citations—three for lacking the requisite seed ground gear permits, and two for failures in submitting harvest data, according to the official report. The outcome of these violations could hit the fishermen with fines climbing up to $350 per offense. Moreover, their catches — totaling 27 sacks of oysters — were seized and returned to their watery beds in the oyster seed ground, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

Immigration compliance also proved to be a stumbling block for some crew members. A report from the joint operation detailed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and USCG officers detained 10 individuals on the first day of the patrol for purported breaches of immigration laws. The specifics of these infractions were not elaborated upon publicly, but the enforcement flag is clear, both in the water and aboard the harvesting vessels; regulation compliance is to be strictly maintained.

This collaborative effort underscores the complex balance regulators aim to maintain between supporting local industries and preserving natural resources. While there is a clear economic driver for communities relying on fishing as a means of livelihood, the coordinated enforcement operation signals the high stakes involved in managing and sustaining the regional oyster population. With officers from different agencies converging on the oyster seed grounds, it's evident that the scrutiny over this sector will remain as rigorous as the waters are deep.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/11/louisiana-fishermen-facing-state-and-federal-scrutiny-over-oyster-harvesting-compliance-1.webp,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:23.502310

Imagine if the federal government enacted legislation that would lead to generations of prosperity for Americans without resorting to budget-busting federal handouts or subsidies.

Imagine if the law guaranteed the most affordable heating and cooling bills for households and businesses for decades to come.

Imagine if such legislation ensured U.S. energy independence and security, forever ending the threat of foreign countries cutting off our supply of oil or gas – and even making other countries dependent on American energy.

As the United States approaches its 250th birthday, could there be any better gift than such guarantees, securities and freedoms?

We don’t have to imagine such a tremendous birthday present. A bill has been introduced in Congress which would accomplish all those objectives and more.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH), has introduced the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act (ARC-ES), designed to codify into law several commonsense directives that the nation’s leaders should have been following for decades.

As described by a press release announcing the bill’s introduction, the legislation “would require relevant federal agencies—such as the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency—to review any actions relating to affordable, reliable, or clean energy within 90 days and submit a report to Congress. The bill guarantees that our most affordable and reliable energy sources, including nuclear and natural gas, remain part of the energy mix – a crucial requirement to guarantee affordable and reliable energy for American households and businesses.”

As Balderson put it, “We saw under the Biden Administration how unelected bureaucrats were able to derail American energy policy by effectively shutting down our baseload, reliable energy productions. This bill restores regulatory sanity. There could be no better gift to all Americans as we approach our 250th birthday than the promise of affordable, reliable and secure energy, for today and for generations to come.”

The ball started rolling in the last couple of years in states like Louisiana and Ohio, with others on the verge of following suit. State after state has begun to break away from the stranglehold of politically motivated energy initiatives based on the fallacy of “alternatives” – a dangerous movement that was putting Americans on the fast track to a bleak energy future featuring unreliable electric grids, reliance on foreign countries to rescue us from blackouts, and skyrocketing energy bills.

As states begin to realize that affordable and reliable energy is crucial to our prosperity and security, they began to act. But always hanging over their heads during the Biden administration (and even before that) was the threat of penalties and loss of subsidies for not setting target dates to phase out oil and gas in favor of a complete reliance on “renewables” like wind and solar.

While so-called “renewables” can be an important part of the energy landscape, they have so far proven to be unreliable, failing test after test when they are artificially employed as the dominant energy provider. The widespread blackouts earlier this year in Spain, Portugal and parts of France were testaments to the still untested properties of “alternatives,” and it’s no surprise that those countries had to turn to natural gas to restore power.

Someday in the future, when their efficacy is more perfected, “renewables” might be in a position to carry more of the energy load. But forcing our most reliable and affordable energy sources to the sidelines before emerging technology is complete is illogical, impractical and unaffordable. The consequences would be disastrous.

While President Trump and his administration are doing all they can to roll back the disastrous Biden energy policies, enduring changes must come from Congress. That’s why the ARC-ES bill introduced by Balderson is not just important – it’s historic.

For the first time, states will know with confidence that their efforts to codify safe, reliable and affordable energy for their citizens will be supported by federal legislation, policies and agencies. Definitions of what constitutes “clean energy” will be aligned locally and nationally. State-based energy projects seeking federal loans or grants will be consistent with federal guidelines.

Crucially, the Balderson bill, as detailed in the press release, “formally defines three key energy terms for energy regulators: affordable, reliable, and clean. Currently, these terms can be left open to interpretation by the executive branch and can shift from one administration to the next. While President Trump has worked to roll back the previous administration’s Green New Deal agenda, this legislation would make those reversals legally binding.”

Thanks to this legislation, science and evidence will replace leftwing political correctness and radical climate change ideology as the guiding principles of U.S. energy policy. When passed by Congress and signed by President Trump, the law will be regarded as among the most significant pieces of legislation ever enacted. It would represent the greatest gift to the U.S. from the president and Congress that Americans could hope for on the occasion of our nation’s 250th birthday.

Americans from coast to coast should contact their elected officials in Congress and urge them to support the ARC-ES act. It’s a fitting birthday present for our entire nation, and a lasting legacy for our children, grandchildren, and generations to come.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/701912_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:06.719686

Barely a week goes by without Donald Trump announcing a new public investment or industry-specific subsidy. Late last month, the Trump administration committed to investing $80 billion in nuclear power. A day earlier, the United States and Japan agreed to a robust set of investments in critical mineral production, an extension of the pattern of direct investments the U.S. government has already made. Meanwhile, the government is now the largest stockholder in Intel and worked with Nvidia to suspend export controls on certain high-powered chips to China.

Some observers have described these actions as a new “economic nationalism,” citing the administration’s prioritization of domestic economic interests over international economic integration. But that term fails to explain what makes this administration’s decision-making unique. Economic nationalism suggests a focus on industries that disproportionately benefit American workers, but the administration talks of the importance of semiconductors, critical minerals, and shipbuilding in the same breath as its support of AI companies, pharmaceutical production, banking and finance, and soybeans. There is little evidence for a particular focus on restoring blue-collar manufacturing jobs, which many might expect from an economic nationalist agenda.

Other writers call it “state capitalism.” But that projects too much coherence onto what so far has been an idiosyncratic collection of half-step policies. State capitalism entails public direction of market activity, either directly through state ownership of firms, or more indirectly through allocation of investment, credit, and subsidies. While the Trump administration’s actions constitute a level of state involvement in markets unusual in American history outside of wars and other crises, there is little evidence that these actions are coordinated across sectors in a systemic fashion.

Or could this be marketcrafting, the term I often use to think about a broad history of state action shaping markets toward the public interest? It isn’t—yet. Marketcrafting requires a particular economic goal, and a coordinated effort to use the tools of public policy to shape the market toward the public interest. Trump’s economic agenda looks to enhance presidential power in pursuit of an independent, even self-sufficient, economy. Just as Trump imagines himself to be superior to other businessmen, he now proclaims that America should dominate other nations through its economic leadership. Relying on other countries is no longer an option, whether they be distant foes such as China or friendly neighbors such as Canada. This search for independence and dominance extends to domestic institutions. No more should Americans need to rely on the expertise of administrative institutions, like the Federal Reserve or the Federal Trade Commission, to deliver economic policy that improves American lives. Only the president, in his unique capacity as the consummate outsider who is now head of state, can make America economically self-reliant and independent.

Trump’s economic policy is best understood as rule by deal. He makes ad hoc agreements with domestic companies, and deals with foreign nations that benefit particular businesses the president favors. Each deal is individually negotiated, unpredictable, and contingent on executive favor.

Lacking clear policy goals and without a coordinating institution to enforce the terms of the agreements, many of these commitments may end up being as thin as the paper the press release announcing them was printed on. Similar deals in the first Trump administration ended in failure, including the promise of 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin created by Foxconn that never materialized, and the eventual bankruptcy of Lordstown Motors in Ohio despite the promise of new investment and jobs.

Some of these deals may eventually add up to a marketcraft, if the administration builds an apparatus to manage the investments. Yet having bulldozed the bureaucracy, the administration has destroyed the institutional capacity required to convert dealmaking into durable policy, making it likely that rule by deal will produce little more than a trail of abandoned commitments and squandered opportunities.

TRUMP HAS ALWAYS SOLD AN IMAGE OF HIMSELF as a master negotiator. During his most recent presidential campaign, he promised farmers in Iowa that he would make a “great deal with China” and bankers in New York that he would use his dealmaking skills to force corporate leaders to onshore manufacturing. Once re-elected, he recruited fellow dealmakers from finance, particularly Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the former investment banker and head of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had 40 years in global investment management. Neither had served in government before, but they had spent decades doing deals.

Foundational to the administration’s dealmaking is the need to create leverage where it might not already exist. In his second term, Trump has used tariffs to bring companies and foreign governments to the negotiating table. In the first Trump administration, and in the Biden years, tariffs were primarily used tactically to craft particular markets, like supporting American automobile production. Trump and Biden both employed them as a means to build negotiating leverage with foreign adversaries, particularly with China, and to signal to voters their seriousness about supporting domestic manufacturing.

But Trump’s vision of the relationship between government and private industry transformed in the COVID crisis. In Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration led a public-private collaboration to develop and distribute lifesaving vaccines, illustrating how policymakers might work with private companies to further political goals. In the absence of a problem as urgent as the pandemic, national self-sufficiency has emerged as the rhetorical goal. Instead of a public-health emergency to compel corporate action, the threat of new taxes on imports has forced business leaders to negotiate with the White House.

The “Liberation Day” tariffs implemented in April are the most sweeping since the 1930s. Trump has used questionable legal authority to claim the ability to set and adjust taxes on imports on any nation, at any time, on almost all imported products, from avocados to diamonds. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the current U.S. average effective tariff rate across all goods is at 18 percent, the highest level in a century. Every country in the world is subject to a base tariff of 10 percent, and additional tariffs are negotiated individually on a country and market basis. The relative level of a tariff has little to do with the balance of trade specific to a country, but rather depends on the administration’s opinion of the foreign leader and how effective business leaders in a particular sector have been in securing lenient terms.

Trump variously justifies the need for tariffs as a means to reshore domestic manufacturing, strengthen national security, or raise revenue. Yet the primary utility of today’s tariffs is the leverage they build over other countries and domestic companies. With the threat of significant damage to their businesses and economies, many American companies and foreign countries feel they have no choice but to seek a deal with the White House to improve their financial position. Relief is routinely conditioned on explicit domestic‑investment pledges—from individual firms and allied governments alike—in the form of new capital expenditures and hiring commitments inside the United States.

Take Pfizer. In May 2025, Trump issued an executive order instructing American pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower prescription drug prices. The president threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on any branded pharmaceutical product entering the United States, exempting only companies that had begun building manufacturing plants in the U.S. Over the summer, the CEO of Pfizer personally negotiated with the president to sell drugs to Medicaid at the low prices it sold to other nations, reducing the price Medicaid pays for these drugs by an average of 50 percent. Pfizer also agreed to participate in a new “TrumpRx” website for direct-to-consumer sales and invest $70 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research. (TrumpRx doesn’t itself sell drugs; it will point patients to company sites where drugs can be purchased at set cash prices.) In exchange, Pfizer received a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, as long as the firm further invests in domestic manufacturing. The administration has paused the 100 percent tariff on pharmaceuticals while other companies proceed to negotiate similar deals, including a recent one with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

This case is not isolated. General Motors announced a $4 billion plan to move production of several models from Mexico back to the United States. The move reduced exposure to tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles and curried favor with the administration. The corporate leaders of Illycaffè, TSMC, and Samsung, among others, have made similar announcements of additional domestic investment.

Tariffs are a major source of leverage, but they are not the only one. Since 2022, U.S. regulators have restricted what semiconductor chips Nvidia, designer of the chips that power the revolution in artificial intelligence, could sell to China. Nvidia developed a specific chip, just powerful enough to meet Chinese demand, which would also comply with American export restrictions. After months of negotiation, including a $1 million gift to Trump to attend a Mar-a-Lago dinner, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the White House for export restrictions to be eased so Nvidia could sell its specialized chips to China. “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I’m giving you a release,” Trump claims he replied. Trump agreed to suspend bans on the export of semiconductors critical to national security in exchange for a kickback payment to the government. Trump initially asked for 20 percent of sales revenue, but Huang negotiated him down to 15 percent. They announced the deal in August. No American company had ever agreed to pay a portion of revenues to obtain export licenses. Bessent called it a “beta test” and said the administration could “see it in other industries over time.”

In other deals, the administration has used government equity investments as a policy instrument. American government has frequently made investments in private companies, sometimes with great success. Policymakers often invest across an industry, like banking in the 1930s, semiconductors in the 1980s, or automotive manufacture in 2009. Rather than supporting a particular market broadly, Trump and his team have singled out specific companies to receive policy advantages. In June 2025, as a condition of Nippon Steel’s approval of the acquisition of U.S. Steel, the government secured a “golden share,” a noneconomic equity stake that gives the president veto power over major corporate decisions including plant closures, salary reductions, and relocation of headquarters. The government has already exercised this authority once, blocking U.S. Steel from shutting down a plant in Illinois. In July, the Department of Defense paid $400 million for a 15 percent equity stake in MP Materials, owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S. The Pentagon agreed to support a price floor for certain minerals and committed to buy all of the magnets MP produced at a new facility for a decade. Other ad hoc equity investments in mining companies have followed, including in Canadian companies Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas. The criteria for these deals are unclear, as are the benchmarks for success.

Also in July, the Trump administration announced commitments for nearly $1 trillion of American investments from the Japanese and South Koreans as part of trade deals. The funds will be invested in specific companies that the Trump administration selects, and all money must be spent by the end of Trump’s first term. In August, the government took a 10 percent equity stake in chipmaker Intel. Rather than converting all grants from the CHIPS Act into equity investments, Trump decided to prioritize Intel because of the “personal” appeal of its CEO.

Rule by deal picks winners and losers—the exact fear that so many free-market voices wielded incorrectly at the Biden administration. In all of these deals, there is no industry-wide analysis, credit facility available to all companies in a sector, or equitable offering of investment capital. It’s also not clear what legal authority they are relying on to make direct investments. This selective approach risks trapping the government in a cycle of doubling down, investing more public money to prop up struggling, politically favored companies rather than letting them fail. Promising firms in the same sector may lose access to private funding, as investors gravitate toward firms with governmental support.

WHILE RULE BY DEAL MAY BE CHAOTIC, it is effective in consolidating political power in the office of the presidency. In no domain is this more apparent than in the response of corporate leaders in the second Trump administration. The transformation from Trump’s first term is dramatic. In August 2017, after a white supremacist ran a car through a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a 32-year-old woman, Trump declared that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Immediately, the CEOs of Merck, Intel, and Under Armour resigned from Trump’s manufacturing council. Dozens of other CEOs followed—including Disney’s Bob Iger and Tesla’s Elon Musk—in what became a mass exodus from White House advisory positions; Gary Cohn, the chair of the National Economic Council, left as well. In the wake of the January 6th, 2021, insurrection attempt, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers quickly condemned the administration, a rare moment of elite business leaders breaking from conservatives.

This time was different. In August 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with a glass plaque mounted on a 24-karat gold base at the White House. The gift was in recognition of Apple’s announcement of a $100 billion U.S. investment commitment, bringing its total to $600 billion over four years. The company received an exemption from steep semiconductor tariffs in return. When Intel’s stock fell after Trump demanded CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation in August over alleged China ties, Tan traveled to the White House. Trump offered to convert the CHIPS program’s grant dollars into a 10 percent government equity stake. Tan accepted, and shares rebounded.

Dozens of other corporate leaders have stayed quiet in the wake of unprecedented moves. Trump has weaponized the National Guard, the Department of Justice, and the IRS to pursue his political enemies, and corporate leaders have stayed silent. He has sought to coerce universities into compliance with his party’s ideology. Independent agencies, from the Federal Trade Commission to the Federal Reserve, are no longer insulated from the president. Immigrants are abducted and rushed into vans to be deported to developing-world countries beyond the rule of American law. For corporate leaders, protecting their businesses requires avoiding criticism of these actions. Rule by deal is an effective political strategy to neutralize what were once among the most powerful and independent voices in civil society.

Some go further, choosing to openly participate in the enrichment of the president, his family and friends, and other officials. In January, Trump made over $1 billion after issuing his own “meme coin,” a crypto asset with no underlying value outside of collective support in the president himself. Weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that meme coins are not securities, exempting them from oversight. The next month, Trump hosted a dinner at one of his golf clubs for the top investors in his coin. Collectively, attendees reportedly spent $150 million to gain access. Meanwhile, the president’s sons “advise” many private companies, enhancing their direct access to the president; a drone company that Donald Trump Jr. holds a $4 million stake in recently won a Pentagon contract. Business leaders can pay anywhere between $1 million and $5 million for access to dinner at Mar-a-Lago and a chance to meet the president. While Trump’s presidential envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff conducted delicate cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, his son solicited billions of dollars from the same governments involved in the peace talks. Lutnick says he has no conflicts of interest, since he no longer runs Cantor Fitzgerald—easily eliding the fact that the firm is now run by his son Brandon. Faced with a disappointing job report, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett countered: “Members of my family have been hired. Both of them started their new jobs about a week ago.”

AD HOC DEALMAKING MAY BE USEFUL for its effect on corporations, but the limits of such an approach may be showing on one of the most important markets to support in the short term: critical minerals. China dominates the production of many of the key inputs to phones, Air Force bombers, and even electricity transformers, giving it a choke point over the United States. Given their importance to American life, there are early signs of an attempt to pursue a critical minerals marketcrafting agenda. The Trump administration has made a series of public investments, procurement guarantees, and long-term loans to companies. For the moment, these deals have no institutional structure coordinating the investments, no structure of accountability to ensure the companies meet performance benchmarks, and no explicit congressional authorization to give investors long-term confidence in the strategy.

The administration could turn into a constructive marketcraft. It might work with Congress to charge a governmental institution with the mission of accelerating the production of important critical minerals in the United States or close allies. One option might be to use the “investment accelerator” at the Commerce Department that is coordinating the $900 billion investment from the Japanese and South Koreans. Or Congress could charter a new institution. Early interest in the creation of a sovereign wealth fund or national investment bank has morphed into a proposal to expand the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a state bank created in the first Trump term charged with making foreign investments to further American foreign policy. Current legislative proposals imagine expanding the mandate to include investments in America and quadrupling its size.

The institution could run an open and transparent process to fund promising companies and cutting-edge research on extraction technologies. Investments could be made with clear benchmarks to ensure adequate progress. Given the urgency of the issue, government could also work to bring together competing companies to share premarket research, just as they did during World War II to produce synthetic rubber, or with semiconductors in the 1980s. Large buyers, like the Department of Defense, could commit to long-term supply contracts to ensure steady demand. The government could also partner with private-sector actors to set up new exchanges that facilitate the trading of futures contracts around these minerals, just as China did over a decade ago. Private investors have already rushed to support the ad hoc deals the government has made in the critical minerals sector. Institutionalizing rule by deal would attract even more capital.

This kind of institutional marketcraft is similar to what Marco Rubio, now secretary of state, and JD Vance, now vice president, championed in the years leading up to Trump’s second inauguration. Rubio and Vance made personal decisions to advance their own political ambitions rather than prioritize the use of institutions to shape markets. In an age of anger at the work of the administrative state, they deprecated their marketcrafting impulses to support Trump’s rule by deal. That will need to shift, if China moves forward on its threats to weaponize its mineral production and the issue rises in critical importance.

Policy-minded people are stuck in an impossible bind: How to advocate for good ideas to improve economic prosperity and resiliency in the short term if they serve to strengthen an autocrat-in-waiting? It feels wrong, or even unethical, to make the case for a more successful economic policy for this administration. Given the attack on the rule of law and the administrative state—key requirements for any marketcraft, let alone democracy, to function—it is unlikely that any kind of robust, effective marketcraft will emerge in the coming years. Perhaps that is for the best. The most potent check on consolidated presidential power may be the president’s own unpopularity, and nothing breeds unpopularity faster than economic mismanagement.

While Trump uses the presidency to force corporations to strengthen his power, Democrats search for policies that will shape markets to bring down the cost of living and boost wages for American families. The lonely voices who claim that unconstrained markets naturally create prosperity now have no political home. Today’s battle is about whether a marketcraft in the public interest can win out over an authoritarian impulse to bully corporations into strengthening presidential power. For marketcrafters, the task ahead will be practical: rebuild rule‑bound institutions with clear missions, persuade experts to return to the administrative state, and restore the practice of pursuing industry-wide programs so that policy does not devolve into picking winners and losers.

Xcel Energy’s sprawling Sherco Energy Hub will be among the United States’ biggest solar farms when the last of its three approved phases powers up next year. Soon after, the central Minnesota site could also host one of the Midwest’s biggest battery clusters.

In a Halloween filing, Xcel asked the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for permission to double its planned battery capacity at Sherco while adding a 200-megawatt fourth phase of solar there and deploying about 136 MW of batteries at a separate site southwest of Minneapolis.

The push to build even more clean energy was spurred by rising electricity demand and the looming phaseout of federal clean-energy tax credits under the Trump administration, which has worked to hamstring renewables while attempting to boost coal and gas generation.

If the commission approves Xcel’s proposal, Sherco would host 910 MW of solar and 600 MW of battery capacity by the end of the decade. At peak production, that would go a long way toward offsetting the output of what Xcel representatives have called the ​“backbone” of the company’s Upper Midwest generation fleet: the roughly 2,300-MW Sherco coal plant, which shut down its first unit in late 2023 and is set to fully retire in 2030.

George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy MN, said the proposal underscores the growing importance of batteries as the grid shifts away from fossil fuels.

“As demand continues to rise, technologies like battery storage are becoming essential to maintaining reliability while integrating more carbon-free generation,” Damian said.

Xcel regional president Bria Shea agreed, saying in a statement that “[w]e’re making a significant investment in battery storage because we see it as a critical part of Minnesota’s energy future.”

The separate 136-MW Blue Lake project would replace retired fossil-fuel capacity, too, boosting output at what’s now a 332-MW gas peaker plant. Xcel retired Blue Lake’s aging oil-fired units earlier this year, leaving two newer gas units operating and freeing up more than 200 MW of grid interconnection capacity.

Minnesota requires its utilities to procure 100% clean power by 2040 and aims to decarbonize its entire economy by 2050, with ambitious targets for building and transport electrification. Meanwhile, developers have proposed at least a dozen large-scale data center projects around the state, including several in Xcel territory. In December, Xcel executive Ryan Long — then serving in Shea’s role — said the company could absorb 1.3 GW of data center capacity by 2032 without derailing its carbon-free power plan, though he added it may need to extend the life of some gas plants to accommodate the load increase.

In the filing, Xcel said it wants to move quickly to expand its generation capacity while there’s still time to qualify for federal clean-energy tax incentives of 30% or more.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will sunset those incentives several years early, forcing most wind and solar projects to begin construction before July 4, 2026, to qualify for the full value. Energy storage projects qualify for the full credit value through 2033, but Xcel said uncertainty around new foreign-sourcing restrictions taking effect next year increases the urgency to deploy storage soon too.

Xcel says it expects to break ground on the Sherco and Blue Lake battery installations next year and power them up in 2027. It aims to commission the Sherco solar project by 2029.

Rather than contract with independent solar and battery installations in its territory, Xcel wants to build and own all three projects itself. In the filing, it said rules set by Minnesota’s grid operator require company ownership of new energy facilities reusing interconnection rights at retiring power plants. The same filing asks the commission to approve agreements to purchase power from several third-party solar and battery projects that will connect to the grid elsewhere.

John Farrell, the Minneapolis-based codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and a frequent critic of the monopoly-utility model, said the looming tax-credit cliff creates an unusual circumstance where the need to quickly develop more clean energy cuts against his preference for an open and competitive bidding process that could result in a better deal for electricity customers.

“I am more sympathetic than I would be normally because we are stuck in the regime we’ve got and there’s a lot of money on the table,” he said, referring to the tax credits whose rollback is expected to raise Minnesotans’ electricity bills in the coming years.

To incentivize faster clean-energy deployment ahead of the cliff created by Trump’s megalaw, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in August said it would allow projects that meet the deadline for federal tax incentives to also access extended eligibility for state renewable energy credits.

Xcel spokesperson Theo Keith said the utility has ​“already taken steps to ensure this portfolio of projects will qualify for federal tax credits before they expire.”

But with the North American Electric Reliability Corp. forecasting a ​“high risk” of capacity shortfalls on the Upper Midwest grid by 2028, there’s a chance that the U.S. Department of Energy issues an emergency order requiring one of the Sherco plant’s two remaining coal units to run past its planned retirement next year, said Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer for Minnesota-based Fresh Energy.

Related: States look to unleash wind and solar boom while tax credits still exist

The DOE has already done so for one retiring coal station in the Midwest, Michigan’s 1,420-MW J.H. Campbell plant. Its operator, Consumers Energy, says that order, which runs at least through Nov. 19 and which the DOE says it could extend for much longer, has already cost consumers at least $80 million. It’s unclear whether a similar order at Sherco would affect Xcel’s battery plans, but it would be disruptive to the utility either way, Gleckner said.

“The uncertainty that scenario contemplates is another reason why it would be a terrible idea,” Gleckner said.

Asked if Xcel had reason to expect a DOE emergency order at Sherco and whether that could interfere with its proposed clean-energy deployments there, Keith said only that Xcel is moving ahead with its plans to retire the coal units by 2030.

The aggressive campaign by successive governments to convert drivers from petrol to electric cars has resulted in collapsing fuel duty receipts for the Treasury. And so, the taxman has now set his sight on the owners of electric vehicles (EV).

The details are constantly evolving, but it is now all but certain that EV drivers will be hit with a new pay-per-mile tax in the upcoming Budget.

Drivers of petrol cars currently pay an average £600 each year in fuel duty, so, as The Telegraph reported last week, the Government is now attempting to ensure EV drivers also pay their “fair share”.

One has to admire the chutzpah of politicians who are attempting to frame the policy in terms of fairness. It was a political decision to relentlessly promote the adoption of EVs as a social good, with administrations of all colours zealously pursuing their Net Zero agenda.

It is impossible to work out how many would have opted for EVs had these vehicles – and the concept of “going green” – not been massively incentivised by the Government.

In January 2024, with the Conservatives in power, the Department for Transport and the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles announced that “the UK now has the most ambitious regulatory framework for the switch to electric vehicles of any country in the world”. This was no mere policy; it had been enshrined in law and declared “the largest carbon saving measure in government’s net zero strategy”.

That new law would enforce the Government’s plan for a “zero emission vehicle transition” by 2035. The first step would mean 80pc of new cars and 70pc of new vans sold in Britain were to be zero emission by 2030. By 2035 that would be 100pc. No new petrol or diesel vehicles could legally be sold beyond this date.

The Labour Party, not to be outdone by the Tories, pledged to bring this ban on new sales of petrol and diesel vehicles forward to 2030. We were told that £2bn had been “invested by government to expand charging infrastructure and incentivise zero emission vehicles”.

Virtue signalling comes at a price, and it is almost always borne by taxpayers.

From developing charging infrastructure to offering discounts through schemes such as the £650m electric car grant, it is taxpayers – including drivers of petrol and electric vehicles alike – who have been funding our politicians’ green dream of no more petrol cars.

Fuel duty, in the meantime, has taken on the role of a sin tax to penalise those who are either unable or unwilling to participate in the EV revolution. While it is pitched as a means of deterring fuel consumption, it’s clearly a nice revenue earner for the Treasury at its heart.

Now those same motorists who have been taxed and penalised and bribed into buying EVs are being lectured on the fairness of the Government’s lopsided, short-sighted policy.

Having successfully brought about an EV revolution, the Government has now realised it has killed off an important source of revenue. To make an honest case for this new pay-for-mile tax, the Chancellor needs to acknowledge the role of green ideology in creating the mess in which she now finds herself.

The system as it stands may well be unfair, but it cannot be right to hold owners of EVs responsible for it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7Yjqr.xbPa_aUkX2oJjrkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/5f170912564a93b8197b0c58f79cbc68,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:42.500816

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — U.N. climate negotiations were expected to begin Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.

André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in “mutirão,” a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.

“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”

Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.

“I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. “The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.

“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said.

The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the negotiations to a potluck dinner.

“Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,” which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. “And it’s obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.”

“The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,” Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.

In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.”

Not only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives,” Stiell wrote.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright summed it up well when he said that energy should make societies richer by driving economic growth, rather than making them poorer, through high prices.

In spite of the tensions in today’s energy debates, global leaders need to re-establish a common ground around energy and climate and recognize that the friction does not in fact represent a choice between decarbonization or affordability—we can still strive for both. This becomes all the more important in light of the rapidly growing demand for energy—and especially of electricity—to meet society’s needs, before even considering the rising power demand of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers.

Reframing the energy and emission conversation

Finding this common ground again means moving on from the term “net zero.” The court of public opinion has made up its mind: net zero is now more associated with higher energy costs than delivering a desirable goal.

And the target is too absolute. The final 10 percent of the journey to net zero could be as expensive as the first 90 percent, which cannot be a sensible use of limited resources. Achieving 90 percent would still be an extraordinary achievement, and any target needs to be credible to be accepted, with a clear pathway for delivering it.

The old talk of an energy trilemma—balancing security, affordability and decarbonization—is evolving. The conversation now also needs to include sovereignty—those resources within a country’s jurisdiction—and abundance—that which is most abundant should be more affordable. Just as this has led the United States to a policy focused on its vast gas resources, in the United Kingdom and Europe more generally, it means a continuing role for the most affordable renewables.

A new approach to energy and climate needs to start with a set of clear principles, which determines priorities, values and what leaders are looking to achieve.

These can be summarized as follows:

Global leaders should prioritize secure and sovereign sources of energy to reduce dependence on others.

Lawmakers should craft energy policy to help drive economic growth, reduce electricity bills, and make countries more competitive.

Industry leaders should champion new technologies that address these challenges.

Public and private actors should ensure that the transition happens in a way that fairly delivers more choice to consumers and empowers them to be part of the solution.

Celebrating and building on achievements

The conversation should also champion what has already been achieved. The UK, for example, in 2022 became the first major economy to reduce its carbon emissions by half (compared to 1990 levels) while still growing the economy by 80 percent; the first major economy to end coal-powered generation; and the country that led the creation of a new global energy industry—offshore wind—in little more than a decade.

These achievements resonate with the public. Polling shows over 60 percent of the public support such policies—far and away the most popular policies of the last Conservative Government. However, it is also clear that people want to secure these achievements in a way that is much more affordable.

Accomplishing this goal has to start from facts—and the facts are promising. Many countries, including some of largest like Brazil and Kenya, get well over 80 to 90 percent of their power from clean resources. Solar generation doubled in the past three years, with China installing more solar power in one month this year than the United States did in the whole of the 2024. And most of the European countries that have lower energy prices than the UK use more renewables. These facts contradict the argument that there is no need for countries like the UK to reduce its emissions if other countries aren’t doing anything—because many are.

Rather than discarding what has been successful, leaders need to look at how energy systems should evolve in a new era and become more affordable.

Taking time to enact common sense policies

It is clear now that gas will have a long-term role to play in the energy transition in the UK and elsewhere. It thus does not make sense, as US President Donald Trump has reminded us, to prematurely close the North Sea with all the job losses that would entail. If gas is to be part of the mix, then it makes sense to maximize the recoveries from the UK’s own offshore fields.

A clean, affordable future also means more nuclear, despite setbacks. For a nation that led the world in civil nuclear power, the UK for one seems to have lost its way. Hinkley Point C, initially promised for 2018, will be fifteen years late and significantly over budget. The United States has had similar experiences. That does not mean nuclear isn’t worth the investment, but that leaders need to learn how to build it better and faster. It means more standardization of design and a regulatory approach that learns more actively from other countries.

COP30: A chance to reset global thinking on energy and climate

These considerations point back to what can be done at COP30. The news from the conference is likely to be disappointing, but it gives those leaders attending the chance to set out a new way of thinking, which shows that they don’t need to choose between energy security, decarbonization, and keeping bills low. Investors need clarity and long-term thinking. We need to see more of that in evidence over the coming days.

This proposed EGR Plan was enabled by House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1007, passed by the Indiana State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Braun earlier this year.
This new policy has been touted by the administration and many in the legislature as “the solution” that will protect consumers from the extraordinary costs that are required to meet the electric demands caused by AI data centers.
Most notably, Statehouse leadership has opined that Indiana policy requires AI data centers to pay at least 80% of the costs incurred to meet their voracious appetite for electricity.
Despite these claims, CAC estimates that at least 39% of EGR Plan costs will fall to other customers in 2030.","—

On Friday November 7, Citizens Action Coalition (CAC) filed expert testimony, with the assistance of counsel from Earthjustice, calling on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to reject Indiana Michigan Power Company’s (I&M) request for what CAC conservatively estimates is a more than $7 billion blank check to build and buy unidentified power plants for new Amazon and Google artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. I&M’s Expedited Generation Resource (EGR) Plan is the largest, and likely the most expensive proposed expansion of generation by a utility in a docketed proceeding in Indiana history.

This proposed EGR Plan was enabled by House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1007, passed by the Indiana State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Braun earlier this year. This new policy has been touted by the administration and many in the legislature as “the solution” that will protect consumers from the extraordinary costs that are required to meet the electric demands caused by AI data centers. Most notably, Statehouse leadership has opined that Indiana policy requires AI data centers to pay at least 80% of the costs incurred to meet their voracious appetite for electricity.

Despite these claims, CAC estimates that at least 39% of EGR Plan costs will fall to other customers in 2030. An even higher share of the costs will hit I&M customers’ bills before 2030 as the result of I&M’s request that the IURC allow them to add a new bill tracker, or surcharge, to monthly electric bills that would force other customers to foot much of the bill well in advance of any new generation resources coming online, and while AI data centers are still under construction.

“Simply put, Google and Amazon are two of the most financially successful companies in human history. They each have multi-trillion-dollar market capitalizations and annual net incomes in the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars,” said Ben Inskeep, CAC’s Program Director. “It is not just and reasonable nor consistent with the state of Indiana’s policies for I&M’s non-large-load customers to be forced to subsidize the costs and risks of serving these Big Tech behemoths.”

The proposed EGR Plan lacks basic information about the rate and monthly bill impacts on other I&M ratepayers. This despite requirements included in HEA1007 that any EGR plan filed by a utility before the IURC describe how the Plan is consistent with providing “affordable electric service” at “economical rates.” Additionally, I&M is requesting preapproval for a massive expansion of natural gas power plants, which would generate 85% of the electricity under the EGR Plan and emit more climate-warming emissions than the combined pollution at five Indiana coal plants, according to CAC calculations.

“Indiana is rapidly emerging as a nationally prominent site of concentrated data center development, with a scope of proposals that promises to double — or more — the demand on electric utilities including I&M,” said Sameer Doshi, Earthjustice Senior Attorney. “Before these enormous facilities join the grid, Indiana regulators must quickly ensure that data centers’ energy usage fulfills the state’s policy and legal requirements for the power sector, including affordability and environmental sustainability.”

Under HEA 1007, the schedule for this case is extremely truncated, preventing more thorough evaluation and review by consumer advocates and the IURC, as well as effectively limiting the public’s ability to object to being forced to subsidize electricity for AI data centers owned and operated by Google, Amazon, and others. The entire procedural schedule is just 90 days from start to finish. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for December 3 with an order mandated by the law by December 31.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:10:40.688271

Pablo McConnie-Saad was until January a senior Treasury Department adviser, working in the office helping homeowners, companies, cities and others to take advantage of the hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

That’s now a key part of his campaign for Pennsylvania’s 3rd District in Philadelphia. McConnie-Saad is focusing his message on affordability and arguing Republicans exacerbated the crisis when they rolled back renewable energy incentives through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“Taking away something like the Inflation Reduction Act, that was going to reduce costs for folks, it’s just devastating,” McConnie-Saad told POLITICO’s E&E News in an interview this month.

“The Inflation Reduction Act was the single greatest investment in this country’s history to try to transition the country away from fossil fuels towards renewables. These are things that would save money for people,” he added. “Energy costs are going through the roof, and divesting from all of these provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act is going to make life more expensive across the board.”

McConnie-Saad worked in Treasury’s IRA Implementation Program Office, which was overseen by then-Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. The job included helping shape tax credit guidance and to inform potential recipients how to use them.

The 2022 law leaned heavily on Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, since most of the clean energy-related programs were changes, expansions or new additions to the tax code.

An example of McConnie-Saad’s work was communicating to nonprofits and municipalities so they could get money under the IRA’s “direct pay” provisions.

“We needed the public to know what the Inflation Reduction Act was and how they could benefit from it. And that required a whole-of-government approach, and the Treasury was a good place to do that,” he said.

McConnie-Saad, whose parents moved to Philadelphia from Puerto Rico, is a political newcomer, running as a progressive candidate. He emphasized his Philadelphia roots in launching his campaign, along with his affordability message.

“Rents are still too high, and there still aren’t enough good jobs,” he says in his launch video.

He’s one of a growing group of 2026 congressional candidates bringing significant energy and climate change experience to their races.

The 3rd District — which includes Philadelphia’s Center City and West Philadelphia — has been held since 2016 by Rep. Dwight Evans (D). Evans, 71, announced this year that he wouldn’t seek reelection, following health concerns including a 2024 stroke.

The May Democratic primary is shaping up to be a crowded one, with McConnie-Saad competing against at least seven other hopefuls.

The field includes state Sen. Sharif Street, whose father and uncle were major political figures. McConnie-Saad used his launch video to accuse Street and others of contributing to the state’s political dysfunction.

Bechtel said the project will store excess solar power for use by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, grid for high demand periods.
It includes about 300 MW of battery storage and is set to be the largest solar project in the state's history.
ENGIE and technology giant Meta recently announced power purchase agreements for more than 1.3 GW of generation from four Texas solar power projects, including a new 600-MW facility near Lubbock.
The firm says it has procured more than 3 GW of solar power so far in 2025.","Israel-based clean energy developer Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources is expanding its U.S. footprint in solar energy—despite growing political headwinds—in selecting Bechtel this month to design and build a 430-MW solar power project in Texas. The Cold Creek Solar+Storage project, sited in Schleicher and Tom Green counties, will have more than 850,000 solar modules and include a 340-MWh battery energy storage system.

Bechtel said the project will store excess solar power for use by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, grid for high demand periods. The contractor did not disclose project cost, but it was stated by the developer at an estimated $460 million, according to a report by Globes, an Israel-based business publication. Doral said construction will begin in the first quarter of 2026, with Bechtel committing to complete work by mid 2028.

“The Cold Creek project highlights the power of an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Scott Austin, Bechtel general manager of renewables and clean power. “Texas continues to lead the nation in blending traditional and renewable resources to strengthen its grid. We are proud to bring Bechtel’s experience to this important project.”

Bechtel ls currently managing design, engineering and construction for the final three phases of the 1.6-GW Mammoth solar project in Starke County, Indiana, set to boost the state’s solar power generation capacity by more than 20%, and be one of the largest U.S. solar projects when completed at the end of 2026, the contractor said. SOLV Energy completed its first 400 MW phase last year. Mammoth is estimated to cost at least $1.5 billion.

Jason Van Deusen, vice president of project management for Doral’s Philadelphia-based U.S. operation, Doral Renewables, said Cold Creek would create more than 500 jobs at peak construction and is the developer's fifth utility-scale solar facility in the state.

Doral also said it has secured a power purchase agreement with an unnamed “corporate buyer” for the project to cover 75% of its energy output, describing the off-taker as a “well-known and experienced energy buyer” that is a new commercial client for the company, which said it operates in 21 states. “This new relationship is a substantial accomplishment and a foundational agreement as Doral continues to expand its operating portfolio across the country,” said Sean Boyle, Doral vice president of markets, noting intent ""to continue this momentum as we embark on another significant project and contribute to the vision of a diverse energy portfolio and resilient grid in America.”

The firm has also proposed the 1.3-GW Vista Sands project in Portage County, Wisconsin, an estimated $1-billion, 7,000-acre solar array approved earlier this year by Wisconsin utility regulators. Doral aims to start construction next spring and begin operating in 2028 or 2029. It includes about 300 MW of battery storage and is set to be the largest solar project in the state's history. No contractor has been announced. The developer last summer settled a lawsuit with opponents concerned about project impact on an endangered species in Wisconsin.

Doral, considered a pioneer in solar and energy storage development in Israel, is also building its first facility to produce green hydrogen. In addition to the U.S. and Israel, the firm operates in Canada, Europe and elsewhere, with a global solar and storage development portfolio of about 18 GW, it said.

Tax Credit Crunch

But renewables project financing now faces new barriers, with the Trump administration squeeze on the federal investment production tax credits affecting solar and wind energy projects. Under new rules issued in August—after Trump signed the giant budget bill in July and issued an executive order to phase out the credits—a project can still qualify if it meets a July 4, 2026, deadline to break ground and is completed by 2030. Projects that don’t start construction by that date must be operating by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director at Evergreen Action, a climate advocacy group, who is concerned that with lengthy state permitting for projects, those that lack approvals may not advance in time to qualify for credits. “By meddling with tax credit implementing rules, Trump is trying to create legal headaches and delays that will prevent clean energy projects from commencing construction in time to claim the credits,"" she said. ""That directly leads to fewer low-cost energy projects being built and higher costs for those that do.”

Despite the headwind, Nick Cohen, president and CEO of Doral Renewables, says the firm is moving forward with its U.S. projects, aiming to seek traditional project financing if the company cannot qualify projects in time for the tax credits, he told E and E News, although noting that power prices would also likely rise. “As long as there’s demand for power and not enough supply, we’ll have customers to buy our power,” he said. ""So our business is actually in a very good position because there’s so little supply out there and such strong demand.”

According to S&P Global, data center power need is expected to rise 22% in 2025 and nearly triple by 2030, with giant tech companies still eyeing solar energy to power the centers quickly.

ENGIE and technology giant Meta recently announced power purchase agreements for more than 1.3 GW of generation from four Texas solar power projects, including a new 600-MW facility near Lubbock. Meta also announced Oct. 30 it has agreed to purchase renewable energy certificates related to two utility-scale solar projects in Louisiana, the 185 MW Beekman Solar and the 200 MW Hollis Creek Solar project, both being developed by Austin-based Treaty Oak Clean Energy and set to operate in third-quarter 2027.

While the energy from both projects will support regional reliability, they will also contribute to Meta’s broader operations and decarbonization strategy, the tech firm said. “When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta head of global energy. The firm says it has procured more than 3 GW of solar power so far in 2025.

Still, risks remain for the renewables sector. About two-thirds of wind projects and nearly three quarters of solar projects set to be online by 2030 have not yet begun construction, according to recent U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics.

Abigail Ross Hopper, group president and CEO of sector trade group Solar Energy Industries Association, says politically motivated administration actions such as tax credit rollbacks, funding cuts and new project review mandates by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum could threaten more than 500 U.S. solar projects that are set to provide 116 GW of capacity—more than half of all new power to be generated in the U.S. through 2030—just as electricity demand from AI is exploding.

Eighteen states are at risk of losing more than half of their planned power capacity through the end of the decade, the group said in a new analysis.

“Every delay and disruption drives up power bills and hands economic opportunity to China,"" Hopper stressed. ""We need to get back to building.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/11/09/BECHTEMAMMOTH.INDIANA.jpg?height=635&t=1762730737&width=1200,N,,2025-11-10 13:10:10.997171

Early, genuine engagement turns potential opposition into partnership — accelerating transmission projects and delivering shared benefits.

The most successful developers align projects with local priorities, from co-ownership models to infrastructure upgrades, creating lasting trust and progress.

The United States needs to build more electric transmission lines at an unprecedented pace to connect and deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy. But we are not building anywhere near fast enough, and that has a lot to with how we build. Too often, developers have followed a “decide, announce defend” approach — selecting routes and announcing plans without community input. That strategy has fueled opposition, delayed projects and, in some cases, stopped them altogether.

How to build transmission with communities, not around them Share on X

Communities as partners

A new report from Environmental Defense Fund and Clean Air Task Force, Beyond the Wires: Community Benefits from Transmission Projects, presents five case studies covering six successfully constructed transmission lines to understand how developers can work with communities rather than against them. We looked at Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts; Big Eddy-Knight in Washington and Oregon; West of Devers in California; Mona-to-Oquirrh in Utah and Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos in California. These case studies show that when developers treat communities as partners, projects move faster, face less opposition and deliver more lasting benefits.

Creative community benefits

The most successful projects went beyond cash payments. They aligned with local priorities, coordinated construction with other infrastructure needs and tested innovative ownership models.

Vineyard Wind partnered with the Town of Barnstable to upgrade sewer infrastructure. The West of Devers Upgrade Project created a groundbreaking co-ownership arrangement with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, advancing Tribal sovereignty and avoiding costly reroutes. Citizens Energy’s partnerships on Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos reinvested profits into clean energy programs. Even settlements reached after conflict, like Mona-to-Oquirrh’s rerouting and conservation land transfer, show the value of addressing community concerns head-on.

Keys to success

Three lessons stand out. First, engage communities early — before routes are locked in. Second, think beyond financial compensation to deliver benefits that matter locally. Third, create space for regulatory and financing flexibility so new models for community benefits frameworks can emerge.

As the nation prepares to build the transmission backbone of a clean energy future, we have a choice: replicate the missteps of the past or embrace community benefit frameworks that foster trust and accelerate progress. These case studies prove that communities are not obstacles to overcome — they are essential partners in building the grid we need.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Fig1_Sunrise-Sunset-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:08:53.735334

Introduction

As part of Japan’s commitment in September to invest $550 billion in the United States, it signed a deal, negotiated with President Trump in October, indicating its interest in partially funding a U.S. nuclear project worth from $80–$100 billion for Westinghouse to build nuclear reactors. Additionally, the U.S.-Japan investment deal includes involving Hitachi GE Vernova to build small modular reactors.

Japan has strong capabilities in manufacturing nuclear reactor parts that require heavy forging of large pieces of metals, while the United States does not. Moreover, Japan is an important trading partner in nuclear energy products for the United States, which imported about $1.4 million worth of nuclear reactor parts – nearly 20 percent of its total nuclear reactor part imports – from Japan in 2024.

This insight provides a summary of the U.S.-Japan investment deal in nuclear energy and reviews the current nuclear energy market landscapes in the United States and Japan – as well as their trade relationship in nuclear energy products.

Japan’s Investment Commitments in the U.S. Nuclear Energy Industry

Overview of the Investment Deal

In October 2025, President Trump signed a deal with Japan outlining several investment projects – a follow on to Japan’s September commitment to invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal covers a variety of areas in which Japan will invest in the United States, including critical minerals, power infrastructure and nuclear reactors. Investment in these three areas would total up to $337 billion, according to the administration’s fact sheet.

Specifically, for nuclear reactors, the Japanese government is committed to partly fund a strategic partnership agreement between Westinghouse, a U.S. nuclear developer, and the U.S. government. Note that the Japanese government’s fact sheet states that this project is up to $100 billion, while the press release from the Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management (joint owners of Westinghouse) states the deal is at least $80 billion. Under the agreement, Westinghouse will build AP 1000 nuclear reactors, which are “the most advanced reactor commercially available.” Japan will also fund the project involving Japanese companies, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group, and IHI, though it does not specify what the involvement will be. The portion of the project not funded by Japan will be funded by U.S. taxpayers.

Notably, under the agreement, the U.S. government would be entitled to 20 percent of Westinghouse’s returns in excess of $17.5 billion. If Westinghouse’s valuation exceeds $30 billion, the U.S. government could require the company to go public and would be entitled to a 20-percent equity stake in the company. This deal is similar to other deals the Trump Administration has made with Intel and MP Materials that provide the federal government more influence over business decisions in a form of state-directed capitalism.

Additionally, the U.S.-Japan investment deal also includes involving Hitachi GE Vernova (a Japanese company established through a strategic global alliance between Hitachi and GE in 2007) to build small modular reactors.

Japan’s heavy manufacturing capability in making nuclear reactor parts

Japan’s unique and strong capabilities in manufacturing heavy nuclear reactor parts may have played an important role in the investment deal’s focus on the U.S. nuclear energy industry.

Accessibility to heavy engineering plants for making nuclear reactor components is critical for new reactor construction. This is because constructing a new reactor requires special technical capabilities and an enormous capacity to move and forge large, heavy parts, such as reactor pressure vessels, which are used to contain the reactor fuel safely and hold the coolant. The newest generation of reactors, such as the AP 1000 included in the U.S.-Japan investment deal, requires pressure vessels that are produced by forging presses with a capacity of 14,000–15,000 tonnes that can handle hot steel ingots of 500–600 tonnes. Few countries currently have the heavy forging capacity, including Japan, China, Russia, France, South Korea, and Czech Republic. The United States does not have the capacity due to the significant decline in new reactor construction since the 1980s.

Japan Steel Works (JSW), a Japanese steel manufacturer, is the world’s largest and most well-known manufacturer with heavy forging capacity. As of 2021, JSW accounted for 80 percent of the global market for large, forged components for nuclear reactors. It has been supplying nuclear reactor components that require heavy forging to the United States since 1974.

U.S.-Japan Nuclear Energy-related Trade

Japan is an important trading partner in nuclear energy products for the United States. In 2024, the United States imported about $1.4 million worth of nuclear reactor parts from Japan, accounting for approximately 19 percent of America’s total imports of nuclear reactor parts. (Figure 2)

In 2024, the United States imported over $162 million worth of nuclear energy-related products, including nuclear reactors, fuel elements, and various reactor components. The import value of nuclear reactor parts (HTS code 840140) remained low over the last few years, totaling just $7.5 million in 2024 (under 5 percent of all nuclear-related imports). In 2025, the United States imported close to $31 million in nuclear reactor parts between January and July, a dramatic increase compared to the last decade.

As Figure 1 shows, there has been a substantial increase in imports of nuclear-related products in the past year. This trend is expected to continue, especially for nuclear reactor parts. Based on median monthly import values in 2025, American Action Forum (AAF) estimated that total imports of nuclear reactor parts will reach approximately $50 million in 2025, representing 30 percent of all nuclear-related imports. This surge in imports is primarily driven by a large increase in trade with Italy, from which the United States imported nearly 80 percent of all nuclear reactor part imports between January and July of this year. (See Figure 2 and Figure 3.) While the United States imported just $65,000 in parts from Italy last year, imports jumped to over $24 million in the first half of 2025, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. This could be due to the U.S.-Italy partnership in nuclear reactor projects earlier this year. For example, Westinghouse signed a $180 million contract with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, drawing supplies from two Italian companies, Ansaldo Nucleare and Walter Tosto. In 2025, the United States also imported nuclear reactor parts from other countries including Canada, Germany, and Mexico.

Despite the Trump Administration’s introduction of wide-sweeping tariffs on “Liberation Day,” the effective tariff rates on nuclear products have not drastically increased. In fact, the tariff rate on parts of nuclear reactors is estimated to have declined from 2.5 percent in 2024 to 0.6 percent this year. Meanwhile, the tariff rate on the broader product category of nuclear-related imports is estimated to remain at close to 3 percent (See Figure 4).

Nuclear Energy in the United States and Japan

The United States is currently the world’s largest nuclear energy player in terms of its total net generation capacity (97 gigawatts) and number of active reactors (94). It significantly leads other top countries in nuclear energy capacity, including France, China, Russia, and South Korea.

Nuclear energy in the United States

A previous AAF’s Forum insight provides a detailed analysis of the nuclear energy landscape in the United States. Although construction of new nuclear reactors has stalled over the past few decades, nuclear energy has been an important energy source, generating about 20 percent of the country’s total electricity. Recently, there has been renewed U.S. interest in nuclear energy from a bipartisan group of congressional members, as well as the administration, the private sector, and the public.

The 2024 bipartisan ADVANCE Act of 2024 (Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy), provides important support for the nuclear energy industry by lowering regulatory compliance costs and removing some regulatory barriers for developers. Following enactment of this bill, U.S. technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, have announced large investment projects in next-generation nuclear technology, including advanced nuclear reactors and small modular reactors.

The Trump Administration has strengthened the policy support for nuclear energy to meet the fast-rising electricity demand, mostly from AI data centers. Earlier this year, President Trump signed four executive orders to accelerate U.S. deployment of advanced nuclear technologies by expediting regulatory review processes, promoting nuclear energy exports, and reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Nuclear energy in Japan

Nuclear energy was an important energy source in Japan, generating about 30 percent of the country’s electricity, until a major accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station caused by an earthquake in 2011. After the accident, public sentiment shifted significantly against nuclear energy in Japan, and the government suspended the operation of its nuclear reactors from 2013–2015 for safety checks.

Since then, Japan has been slowly restarting its nuclear reactors, and it currently has 33 operable nuclear reactors, generating about 6 percent of the country’s total electricity. It is planning to increase the share of nuclear power in the electricity generation mix to between 20–22 percent by 2030.

Looking Forward

As the United States expands its nuclear energy production and Japan continues to ramp up its nuclear energy capacity, it is important to monitor the progress toward realizing the nuclear energy investment commitments in the U.S.-Japan deal. How much of the promised investment is realized, and in what form (capital, nuclear reactor products, or technology support) is key to achieving the investment targets in the deal. It will also be crucial to keep an eye on how this U.S.-Japan nuclear investment deal unfolds in the broader context of the U.S.-Japan trade relationship.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nuclear-power-plant-6798214_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:09:07.841182

RealClearFoundation

While the House of Representatives has understandably been quiet during the government shutdown, not everyone has been idle.

While most members of Congress were home in their districts, Rep. Troy Balderson, an Ohio Republican, quietly introduced a short, potentially consequential piece of energy legislation called “The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act.”

“We the People” will celebrate our nation’s 250th birthday next Independence Day. And truth be told, we are crossing this milestone birthday showing our age. We are politically bipolar. We are in debt. Our infrastructure is crumbling and our schools are a mess. We are in need of several new leases on life.

For starters, if America is to be made great again – by anyone’s definition – it will require a commonsense reordering of our approach to energy and electricity generation. Troy Balderson’s approach offers the kind of clear-eyed vision we need.

Aimed as a corrective to the “Green New Deal” priorities that took hold during the Biden administration, the ARC would direct federal agencies to reorder their policies with attainable objectives aimed at increasing attainable and cost-effective domestic energy production – and providing benchmarks allowing for effective congressional oversight.

The bill would formally require government regulators to prioritize these three words when evaluating energy projects: Is it affordable? Is it reliable? Is it clean? Most politicians give lip-service to these concepts, but under current law they are left open to interpretation by the executive branch and they shift from one administration to the next, Balderson points out. His bill would essentially codify a true “all of the above” energy approach – and would benefit all Americans regardless of their ideological leanings.

If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, his legislation would require the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress within 180 days documenting what they are doing to incorporate all-of-the-above into our national energy strategy. Windmills and solar farms wouldn’t be suddenly sidelined. (On the other end of the energy scale, neither would coal.) But this bill would virtually assure that all viable, affordable, and reliable energy sources – including nuclear power and natural gas – remain in the nation’s energy mix. In other words, it replaces old habits and ideological fads with practicality as a way of supporting American families and businesses.

I don’t question liberals’ commitment to a cleaner environment. But Democrats campaigned this autumn on the need for “affordability” – and found a receptive electorate. This legislation would turn that rhetoric into action. And just as important to poor and middle-class families, it fuels our nation’s efforts to rebuild and onshore the energy sector that fuels economic growth.

Greater reliance on natural gas and nuclear power will deliver green and clean dividends. ARC is a win, win, win. The status quo is a lose, lose, lose.

Mine is a nonpartisan appeal for making this bill law. Legislators of America, let’s meet in the middle of the aisle. Without the re-ordering of energy interests in this bill – affordability first, reliability second, and clean third – our rate cards are going to go through the roof. The economy, the hopes of the American people, and their pursuit of happiness are predicated on considerably lower rates.

The American ratepayer is the American family. And “We the People” – the payers – are suffering unnecessarily, and it is not by the hand of foreign actors beyond our democratic reach and control. It is being done by those who are supposed to represent us.

My fellow Americans, lend me your ears for an ADHD minute. In the recent past, we have been governed by a shackling set of priorities. Clean energy has been in the driver seat, followed by affordability, and then reliability. This “CAR” approach has not delivered on its promises. And it is structurally incapable of getting us over the fast-approaching AI demand hill.

The status quo CAR approach and mindset can’t even service the status quo. Look no further than New Jersey, which is having a voter revolt partly because of rising electricity costs. This is not a only a blue state problem. Georgia sent an affordability message last Tuesday that should be a wake-up call for all red states, which like Texas have chased green subsidies. The rate increases are coming due for all.

If we continue to follow our current energy priorities, brown-outs, economic stagnation, and out-migration to energy-rich states will follow. “We the People” will all benefit from the passage of ARC Energy Security. Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters will all benefit.

What is our short-term future if we do nothing new? Take your present energy bill and multiply it by 2.3, which is the variance between American and British ratepayers in the business sector.

New Jersey, what’s the mid-term future of sticking with CAR? Give your present rate card woes about a 100% increase. This is what German ratepayers are gouged for – around 40 cents per kilowatt hour – to underwrite their country’s march towards deindustrialization.

Texas and Florida – states with lower energy costs and the beneficiaries of out-migration from blue states that have gone green crazy – deduct money from your energy bill and think about what that money can do in the hands of citizens spending it in your state, and investing for retirement.

AI’s appetite for reliable energy will require an energy-capacity building boom. The ARC approach will get us there; CAR will not. John Fetterman, Congressman Balderson needs a co-sponsor in the Senate. Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.

In the second Trump administration, the president has issued various executive orders, and Cabinet secretaries have put out their directives while incoming Democratic governor Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility costs. There’s a better way to govern – a better way to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.

To defend our livable future, our leaders must end carbon capture subsidies, ban the buildout of carbon capture infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.","The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture pays polluters for continuing to drill, frack, burn, pollute, and pursue dangerous climate boondoggles.

Fossil fuel barons, tech companies, and even some climate advocates have hailed carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a climate solution. But in the decades since the U.S. began subsidizing it, this technology has only served to give cover to Big Oil and Gas to keep polluting.

Carbon capture promises — and has failed to — fight climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from smokestacks or the air and permanently keeping it out of the atmosphere. It enables a fantasy where dirty energy can be made clean with the right technology; where we can fight climate change while continuing to drill and burn fossil fuels.

Nevertheless, U.S. leaders continue to lavish the industry with lucrative tax incentives. Recently, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill even bolstered 45Q, the main avenue for these incentives. He’s made even more taxpayer funds available to polluters.

Carbon capture won’t save the climate, and neither will 45Q subsidies. In fact, with the way 45Q works, it can pay dirty energy companies to pollute even more. Our newest research shows how the program rewards companies for drilling, burning, and wreaking havoc on our planet.

Here are four ways 45Q incentives for carbon capture are driving more pollution.

1. 45Q Pays Companies to Create More Toxic Pollution

The 45Q program rewards tax credits to carbon capture projects for every ton of CO2 they capture and store. This risks creating a perverse incentive for companies to pollute more, just so they can get those credits.

Take coal, for example. In 2024, coal-fired power plants paid an average of $2.55 per million BTU of coal. Burning that coal would emit CO2 that, if captured, would be worth $8.14.

In other words, carbon capture projects could buy coal only to burn it, capture just half of the CO2 emissions, and still make a profit. By incentivizing more fossil fuel extraction, 45Q threatens to drive more pollution.

Notably, carbon capture only addresses one kind of pollutant — CO2. It does nothing about other climate-wrecking gases like methane. Nor does it rein in other kinds of pollution from fossil fuels.

By giving climate cover for fossil fuel activities to expand, carbon capture threatens to grow the industry’s other pollutants, such as smog-forming and asthma-worsening nitrogen oxides and carcinogens like benzene.

Incentivizing carbon capture drives more drilling and burning with dubious climate benefits, while communities near fossil fuel operations will face even more dangerous pollution.

2. 45Q Incentivizes More Drilling through Enhanced Oil Recovery

The 45Q program rewards an oil drilling technique under the ridiculous guise that it’s a climate solution. Drillers can claim lucrative tax credits for enhanced oil recovery (EOR): injecting CO2 into a well to push out the last dregs of oil.

Notably, the vast majority — 89% in 2022 — of carbon captured in the United States is actually used to drill for more oil through EOR.

This, of course, is far from “good for the climate”; in fact, we found that burning the oil produced through EOR emits more CO2 than is injected during the process. Moreover, by one count, in 2022 EOR enabled the drilling of 88.2 million barrels of oil that would have otherwise stayed in the ground.

Nevertheless, with the 45Q provisions passed in the Inflation Reduction Act, companies could receive $60 per ton of CO2 they used for EOR (compared to $85 for “geological sequestration,” or plain old storage).

With Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, companies can now also get $85 per ton for EOR. This has unlocked a potential $210 billion windfall for oil companies to just drill more.

3. 45Q Rewards Gas Processing Facilities

45Q also allows gas processing facilities to use a simple relabeling trick to receive tax credits. This has helped to inflate reports of carbon capture’s success. Now, 60% of the CO2 the EPA reports as “captured” comes from gas processing facilities.

How has this happened? Many gas wells also contain naturally occurring CO2. Drilling brings this CO2 to the surface, along with the methane gas that’s sold and burned for energy. These processing facilities have long separated this CO2 and other waste from the methane and injected it back underground.

By relabeling these injection wells, many gas facilities can claim lucrative 45Q tax credits without changing a thing about their dirty operations.

Worse, reinjecting this naturally occurring CO2 creates the risk that companies start extracting otherwise unprofitable CO2-rich gas. With 45Q tax credits, they could inject a portion of the CO2, emit the rest, and still make a profit.

In this way, 45Q threatens to incentivize more CO2 emissions and gas production than we — or the planet — need, all to capture government subsidies.

4. 45Q Encourage Dirty Climate Boondoggles

The lure of 45Q tax credits has driven the expansion of whole industries of climate scams. That includes so-called “blue hydrogen” — hydrogen produced from natural gas and paired with carbon capture.

Blue hydrogen is another boondoggle falsely hailed as a climate solution. Besides propping up the gas industry, capturing CO2 at blue hydrogen facilities does nothing about the massive amounts of climate pollution emitted by the extraction and transportation of natural gas for blue hydrogen. In fact, these upstream emissions almost fully cancel out any emissions reduced via carbon capture.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of U.S. hydrogen is used for oil refining (68%) and harmful nitrogen-based fertilizers (21%). Subsidies supporting blue hydrogen indirectly subsidize Big Oil and Big Ag, too.

45Q is also boosting dirty ethanol; corn ethanol refineries have become one of the most rapid adopters of carbon capture. Touted as a “climate-friendly” gasoline alternative, ethanol is actually terrible for the climate.

Corn grown solely to be turned into fuel has devoured vast tracts of farmland and wreaked havoc on our environment. Accounting for its full lifecycle from seed to tank, ethanol is responsible for almost a quarter more emissions than fossil gasoline.

Tax credits from 45Q threaten to fuel this fire further. Similar to EOR and gas processing, they pay ethanol refineries for something they already do — capturing their waste CO2. Meanwhile, there’s no technology to address the climate pollution at every other step of the ethanol cycle.

Rather than help the climate, 45Q is a boon to dirty climate scam technologies, paying them to expand and pollute even more.

Big Oil and Gas Companies Know the Truth — You Should, Too

In press releases and on public stages, fossil fuel companies and utilities are touting their expansion of carbon capture as climate work.

Behind the headlines, they’re singing a different tune. According to Occidental’s CEO, “If it’s produced in the way that I’m talking about [with carbon capture], there’s no reason not to produce oil and gas forever.” At an oil and gas industry conference, an ExxonMobil lobbyist emphasized that carbon capture was about profit, not the environment.

For these companies, carbon capture and storage is a mirage behind which they continue to drill, burn, pollute, and profit as they always have. The lucrative tax credits of the 45Q program will reward them for even more of the same.

We can’t let them get away with this. Congress must change course on 45Q. To defend our livable future, our leaders must end carbon capture subsidies, ban the buildout of carbon capture infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fww_featured_45QFundingScam-1-2880x1200-C-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:09:54.407083

In response, state authorities are aggressively stepping in to fill a perceived enforcement void, taking decisive action to protect public health and safety.
State environmental agencies are adopting cost-effective enforcement methods, such as prioritizing citizen complaints, issuing warning letters instead of formal enforcement actions, and providing guidance to improve compliance.
The message for businesses is clear: Do not wait for state enforcement to escalate or for federal oversight to resume.","The second Trump administration has launched an aggressive deregulatory campaign at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), raising concerns among legal experts, environmental advocates, and public health officials. Central to the deregulatory agenda is a redefinition of EPA’s mission, including a reallocation of enforcement priorities and resources. The potential consequences for environmental enforcement affecting chemical manufacturers under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)1remain uncertain. In response, state authorities are stepping in to protect public health and safety at the state level under state law.

During EPA's reorganization and reallocation of enforcement priorities and resources, companies should not scale back their compliance efforts. In this period of extreme and unpredictable change, businesses will benefit from conducting internal audits, reviewing product stewardship, and evaluating environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices to help ensure full compliance with FIFRA, TSCA, and other applicable environmental laws. Proactive steps, including voluntary self-disclosure under EPA's self-disclosure policies, can reduce enforcement risk and protect companies as regulatory priorities fluctuate, now and in the years ahead.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has altered EPA’s enforcement capacity to an uncertain extent, potentially representing a shift in the federal role in environmental and public health protection. In response, state authorities are aggressively stepping in to fill a perceived enforcement void, taking decisive action to protect public health and safety. Many states, including California, are implementing innovative and robust strategies to help ensure compliance, assuming part of the enforcement role performed by the federal government up to now. State environmental agencies are adopting cost-effective enforcement methods, such as prioritizing citizen complaints, issuing warning letters instead of formal enforcement actions, and providing guidance to improve compliance.

At the state level, environmental self-audits have become an essential component of due diligence in mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate transactions. These audits serve two main purposes: They help identify potential environmental liabilities associated with target companies, and they demonstrate proactive compliance, which can mitigate enforcement risk under self-disclosure and audit policies. In today's deregulatory environment, self-audits offer critical legal and business protections. Pre-acquisition audits identify legacy violations, cleanup responsibilities, and compliance gaps that could become costly after closing, while post-acquisition audits uncover undisclosed violations, allowing for timely voluntary disclosures under EPA and state policies. Post-acquisition audits, conducted promptly after closing, can identify previously undisclosed violations and enable timely voluntary disclosures under EPA's Audit Policy or analogous state programs providing substantial penalty mitigation—or even complete penalty elimination—for companies that self-disclose and correct violations discovered through qualified audits, particularly when performed in good faith and not under imminent enforcement threats.

Historically, along with EPA, state agencies have provided substantial penalty mitigation—or complete elimination of penalties—for companies that voluntarily disclose, correct, and take steps to help prevent a recurrence of violations identified through good-faith audits. For businesses in highly regulated sectors, such as chemical manufacturing, formulation, and distribution, self-audits demonstrate diligence, reduce transactional and operational risk, establish ""good actor"" status in enforcement actions or private litigation, and build credibility with regulators, investors, and the public. Whether employed for transactional due diligence or ongoing compliance, self-auditing remains one of the most effective tools for managing environmental risk amid regulatory uncertainty.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has introduced unprecedented uncertainty in federal environmental oversight. In response, state regulatory agencies are stepping in to fill the enforcement void, ensuring continued protection of public health and the environment under state law. Businesses should act proactively by conducting self-audits, strengthening compliance programs, and considering voluntary disclosures at both the federal and state levels. Taking these measures now safeguards operations and transactions, preserves public trust, and positions companies to navigate rapidly shifting enforcement priorities.

The message for businesses is clear: Do not wait for state enforcement to escalate or for federal oversight to resume. Proactive steps reduce the risk of penalties, reinforce public confidence, help ensure compliance, and help avoid enforcement-related business interruptions in a complex and evolving regulatory environment. Companies seeking guidance on next steps or tailored compliance strategies can rely on experienced professionals with deep expertise across multiple administrations and regulatory landscapes to chart an effective path forward.",https://www.steptoe.com/a/web/173755/3ZEKXR/steptoe_og.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 15:01:33.536192

""Phosphate and potash production is critical to food security, and food security is national security,"" said Bruce Bodine, President and CEO of The Mosaic Company. ""These designations rightly recognize the strategic value of domestic phosphate and potash production, not just for farmers, but for the entire country."" According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of the Interior's Critical Minerals List serves as a strategic tool to strengthen national mineral supply chains. It informs federal policy, investment priorities, and permitting processes aimed at enhancing economic resilience and national security.

Phosphate and potash underpin the nation's ability to produce food efficiently and sustainably. As essential nutrients in fertilizer, they support the crops that feed families, livestock, and industries across the country. A stable domestic supply helps protect America's food system from global market disruptions, so that U.S. agriculture, and by extension, the nation's economy and security, remain strong.

The decision to designate phosphate as a critical mineral also highlights the broader strategic value of its byproducts. Potash and phosphate are but two critical minerals present in Mosaic's fertilizer production. A production byproduct, phosphogypsum (PG), contains meaningful amounts of five rare earth elements (REEs) which also are critical minerals. All are critical to the nation's defense, energy, and technology sectors. Phosphate fertilizer production yields enough of these materials to serve as a meaningful domestic source in meeting U.S. demand.

Mosaic is supporting ongoing research into the responsible recovery of these materials from its byproducts. Rare earth elements are vital to technologies such as AI computing, electric vehicle batteries, missile guidance systems, and clean energy infrastructure, while uranium remains essential to clean nuclear power, a cornerstone of U.S. energy independence.

Potash and phosphate's designation as a critical mineral reinforces their role at the foundation of American agriculture and the industries that depend on it. From strengthening the nation's food supply chain to supporting emerging technologies, phosphate remains essential to both economic stability and national security, an area where Mosaic continues to lead through responsible production and innovation.

About The Mosaic Company

The Mosaic Company is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. Through its Mosaic Biosciences platform, the company is also advancing the next generation biological solutions to help farmers improve nutrient use efficiency and crop performance sustainably.

Lessons from the field: Moving beyond money

Effective community benefit frameworks deliver more than financial compensation—they create lasting value by addressing local priorities and embracing innovative solutions.

Coordinated infrastructure

In Massachusetts, the Vineyard Wind project aligned its cable route with the Town of Barnstable’s planned sewer upgrades. The collaboration saved taxpayers an estimated $3 million, minimized construction impacts, and addressed water quality concerns through a Host Community Agreement.

Tribal co-ownership

The West of Devers Upgrade Project in California pioneered a co-ownership model with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. By making the Tribe a transmission operator, the project upheld tribal sovereignty and avoided building a costly new line.

Reinvesting profits

California’s Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos projects partnered with the nonprofit Citizens Energy, which invested in the transmission lines and reinvested profits into local clean energy initiatives, including a community solar program in Imperial Valley.

Conservation and mitigation

In the West, the Big Eddy-Knight (WA/OR) line funded conservation measures to avoid litigation. Similarly, a legal settlement for Mona-to-Oquirrh in Utah delivered a community-approved reroute and preserved 130 acres of hillside for permanent conservation and recreation.

Keys to future success

As the U.S. expands its next generation of transmission lines, these case studies make one thing clear: community benefit frameworks are essential. Success depends on three actions: engage communities early to prevent costly delays, look beyond money to create lasting local value, and stay flexible with creative financing and ownership that build broad support.

This seven-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments and education systems are training this growing workforce.

From young ages, Joel Duncan and Haidyn Emerson were interested in how things work.

Duncan started small, familiarizing himself with the engines that power snowblowers, lawnmowers and four-wheelers. Working on a Shelby Cobra sports car kit at age 12 got him into bigger engines.

“That really cemented it as a cool thing to do,” he said of working on cars.

As a toddler, Emerson said, he liked taking things apart and putting them back together. “Ever since I was 3, I would take the door hinges off,” he said. “I’d take cardboard boxes and skateboards and make a wagon.”

Naturally, the two young men plan to work with their hands for a living. They’re enrolled in a college automotive services technology program to that end.

Unlike most of their predecessors, these aspiring repair technicians will enter the field with experience working on both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

The college, Minnesota State Community and Technical College in Moorhead, Minnesota, will embed electric vehicle courses into its curriculum starting this coming spring, a reflection of what an evolving automotive industry demands from its workforce.

M State Moorhead, as the college is known, developed the course after securing a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2022. Instructors have since been trained on the technology, readied two units for the 2026 semester debut and acquired vehicles and charging stations — one of which is available to the public outside the shop.

Other schools within the Minnesota State system — the larger of the state’s two higher education institutions (the other being the University of Minnesota), with seven universities and 26 state colleges — are offering similar units, leading the charge on EV technical education in Greater Minnesota.

The work is happening while the federal government’s support for renewable energy initiatives has gone from the fast lane to an off ramp. Compared with President Joe Biden’s embrace of clean energy investments, President Donald Trump has taken a more adversarial stance, saying that the elimination of EV incentives promotes “true consumer choice.”

Despite this political gear shift, M State’s funding is unaffected for now. Cindy Bailey, the grant coordinator for the college, said the prevailing trends show the automotive industry needs workers ready to work on electric vehicles.

“The fact of the matter is, whatever the political climate and landscape, people own electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles,” she said. “We owe it to our students to provide the most well-rounded training to make them competitive in the labor market.”

An industry jolt

Below a Dodge Durango SUV, a GMC Sierra pickup truck and other gas-powered vehicles elevated on lifts — so students like Duncan and Emerson can work on them — the college’s training space has newer, permanent additions, including a Chevy Bolt electric vehicle. Next spring, students will learn the ins and outs of electric vehicle safety and maintenance on the Bolt, bought with grant funding.

Clay County, where the campus is located, had a modest 244 electric vehicles on the roads as of July, according to data compiled by Atlas Public Policy. It’s likely that many more EVs are zipping around the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area.

Minnesotans own about 79,000 EVs. That accounts for only 1% of all vehicles, but state and national sales trends indicate acceleration. EV sales rose each year between 2015 and 2023, according to a Minnesota Department of Commerce report.

EV buy-in is most noticeable in the Twin Cities metro area, although four counties in Greater Minnesota have more than 1,000 in use. Olmsted County has the most in Greater Minnesota, with 2,200, followed by Wright, St. Louis and Stearns counties.

Minnesota is targeting a goal of 20% of registered vehicles being EVs by 2030, but a few speed bumps could keep the state from getting there. This year, the Trump administration ended tax credits for EV purchases and halted funding to build out a charging station network — two renewable energy initiatives approved during Biden’s term.

All this aside, EVs are undoubtedly becoming more common. More than 6% of all vehicle sales in Minnesota were EVs by 2023.

Having more EVs on the road without enough repair technicians to service them, however, wouldn’t do any good.

When a gas-powered vehicle goes kaput, owners have options. A dealership, an automotive center or maybe even a one-person shop could provide the right mix of affordability and trust when the inevitable breakdown occurs.

EV owners have options as well, but they are more scarce, particularly in rural areas, mostly limited to dealerships or specialized shops.

David Schulz, automotive instructor at M State, sees this changing in time.

“When something new comes out, the dealers are going to work on it first,” he said. “Then once it gets to a warranty, as soon as enough demand gets there you start seeing shops for it.”

Those shops will need technicians. A 36% increase in automotive service technicians and mechanics will be required to meet industry needs by 2030, according to projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Adapting to change

This is where Minnesota colleges fit into the equation, rolling out courses to familiarize the next generation of workers with electric vehicles.

Within Minnesota State’s system, Anoka Technical College started an automotive electronic diagnostic specialists program. Ridgewater College in Willmar folded EV maintenance into its programming. Minnesota State College Southeast in Winona introduces students to hybrid and electric vehicles using two vehicles and a charging station, a similar setup to what M State Moorhead will do.

Schulz grew up on a farm learning how to fix equipment before pursuing a career in automotive services. Fellow instructor Michael Rud, like Duncan, got into cars by working on a Shelby Cobra kit.

As educators, they’ve enjoyed learning about EVs in order to pass on lessons to students. Trade schools are teaching the electricians, plumbers and other workers of tomorrow, but Rud thinks few are changing as rapidly as automotive services.

“Diesel changes, too, but auto changes the most,” he said. “It’s pretty exciting. You’re constantly learning, and every day is different.”

What M State Moorhead staff learns while developing the courses may be shared with another institution in its system, Riverland College in Albert Lea. Riverland previously collaborated with M State Moorhead on autonomous vehicle technician coursework, also funded by a National Science Foundation grant.

Olle Gladso contributed to the curriculum’s development in Albert Lea before retiring last spring. He’s taken to electric vehicle technology, using a Ford Mustang Mach-E in his daily life.

EV growth, and an industry surrounding it, is inevitable, he said.

“Electric vehicles will continue to gain market share,” he said. “They’re simpler, they’re cheaper to maintain and they’re more reliable.”

Understanding how they work isn’t so simple. Technicians need to think differently about how to service EVs compared with gas-powered vehicles, Gladso said.

He gave the example of a window not rolling down. In an older vehicle, a mechanic needs to understand the mechanical components enabling a window to operate as intended in order to diagnose and fix it.

EV issues are more abstract, Gladso said. Mechanics may need to understand electrical systems to diagnose an issue. “For a technician to be successful today, they have to have a solid, and I mean very solid, understanding of electric concepts,” he said.

M State Moorhead’s two new units in spring 2026 will cover electric platforms and electric/hybrid technology. With electricity, safety is absolutely essential, Rud said.

“If they’re overconfident or not confident enough, both of those can cause problems,” he said.

Gladso used to show his students a picture of a house’s foundation to illustrate what’s most important in a unit. Learning to be safe around electric systems will be the foundation for the rest of the coursework, he said, as the voltage involved is dangerously high.

“When it’s an 800-volt circuit, you don’t have to touch it for it to kill,” he said. “Just get close enough and it’ll electrocute you.”

Talking after a class in October, Duncan and Emerson said they’re eager to learn. Both students are aware of the trends in their chosen field.

“That just seems where the trajectory is heading,” Duncan said of electric vehicles.

Outside of class, they’re working at dealerships. As is the industry norm, electric vehicles are sold there, so any hours put into electric vehicles on campus will come in handy after graduation. Someday, they said, they could see themselves opening their own shops.

Duncan said being able to fix electric vehicles would only give him a leg up in a competitive market. “I don’t want to set limitations for myself because I don’t have the knowledge to do something,” Duncan said.

Certain blue-collar jobs will always need workers, Gladso said. The rise of EVs has him feeling optimistic that automotive services will remain one of them.

“You’re always going to need somebody to fix your car,” he said.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RNN-EV-Programs-102825-es_5.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:03.876189

This story was originally published November 10, 2025 at 8:51 AM.","Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the Trump administration Monday for “doing everything to put America in reverse” and trying “to vandalize California’s leadership” on climate, warning that the country risks losing its competitive edge in the clean energy economy.

The remarks came during his trip to Brazil, where Gov. Gavin Newsom joined Milken Institute CEO Richard Ditizio in Sao Paulo, speaking out as California fights a legal battle with the federal government over its right to enforce its own clean air and climate rules.

Newsom left California on Friday afternoon to participate in COP30, a United Nations climate conference taking place in Belém, Brazil, where world leaders, governors and investors are gathering to discuss strategies for accelerating the global clean energy transition.

The California governor has promoted his trip as a stark contrast to the Trump administration’s approach to energy policy, which embraces the “drill, baby, drill” slogan and seeks to expand fossil fuel production — including efforts by the president to block California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle emission standards.

When asked why climate action has been slow to gain broader public and political support, and how to better communicate its economic benefits, Newsom connected the challenge to the lack of federal leadership, warning that the United States risks falling behind other countries in the clean energy economy.

“China gets it,” he said. “America is toast competitively, if we don’t wake up to what the hell they’re doing in this space — on supply chains, how they’re dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone here, EU, elsewhere, Africa.”

Asserting that California’s landmark green initiatives were built on bipartisan efforts by previous administrations, Newsom said California has been a reliable partner in advancing climate and environmental policy.

“I cannot say that for the United States of America, particularly as it relates to the current occupant in the White House — quite the contrary — but the state of California has been a consistent partner for a half century and will continue to be for decades to come,” Newsom said

The Democratic governor said California has continued to thrive despite tensions with Washington, arguing that in the state, “we punch above our weight” in clean energy investment and innovation in sectors like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage.

Meanwhile, he also noted that the state is leading in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, which require significant amounts of energy and have drawn criticism from researchers for potentially driving up electricity demand and straining the country’s transition to clean energy.

“I am proud that California dominates in artificial intelligence as well. We have no peers,” he said, adding that he is mindful of the growing energy demands tied to innovation and entrepreneurship and citing California’s streamlined permitting and procurement reforms as evidence of the state’s leadership in balancing technological growth with sustainability.

The OBBB retained 100 percent bonus depreciation, a policy that once sparked a wave of spending.
Looking more broadly, cuts in the OBBB to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will have state-level budget impacts.
“The customer base the ski industry enjoys tends to be resilient,” he added.
Any time I’ve stretched our business to pay for bigger capex projects, we’re generally very happy that we did.","When we first started reporting this story, the question seemed straightforward: What does the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) mean for ski area capital planning?

The bill includes provisions such as the continuation of 100 percent bonus depreciation, R&D deductions, permanent pass-through tax relief, and a new “pay-to-play” NEPA option. It also accelerates the phaseout of clean energy and EV incentives. On paper, these provisions appear likely to affect some ski area investment decisions.

But after talking with operators and industry voices around the country, a theme emerged: while the OBBB matters, the real influences on capital planning today are tariffs, inflation, and the high cost of borrowing.

What the Bill Gives and Takes Away

Tax policy. The OBBB retained 100 percent bonus depreciation, a policy that once sparked a wave of spending. “The first time around, it absolutely drove projects for us and for the industry,” recalled consultant and former Vail Resorts COO Chris Jarnot. “There were shovel-ready projects that maybe didn’t quite meet the ROI threshold, or that banks weren’t confident in at smaller areas, but when the math changed and you could deduct the capital upfront, that pushed a lot of them forward. It also created an impetus. Even if you hadn’t done the ROI work yet, this was the push to figure it out.”

That helped fuel what National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) government affairs consultant Grant Colvin called “a golden age of ski area infrastructure.”

Today, though, “The fact that it’s been extended doesn’t really change anything,” said Jarnot.

“Bonus depreciation continues a lot of the benefits that had been in place, so from that standpoint, that’s a positive,” added Bill Jensen, longtime industry leader and a partner at Sundance Resort, Utah. “I’m not sure that ski area owners make their capital decisions based on the depreciation schedule, but the policy does allow more dollars to remain in the business that can be utilized across the whole business.”

The bill also continued immediate research and development expensing and made permanent the 20 percent pass-through deduction.

“If industry investments slow,” said Jensen, “it won’t be the BBB, it will be the economy and the interest rate environment.”

“Pay-to-play” NEPA. Another notable change: OBBB’s “pay-to-play” NEPA provision. This allows project sponsors to “opt in” by paying 125 percent of the Forest Service’s costs to supervise NEPA reviews. Once the fee is paid, an environmental assessment must be issued within six months, and an environmental impact statement within one year of the notice of intent.

In a “Capitol Watch” report, NSAA director of public policy Geraldine Link cautioned that other statutory reviews, such as Section 106 cultural reviews or Endangered Species Act consultations, are not bound by these deadlines. Nor are forest plan amendments or objection processes.

That suggests the new provision may not deliver the clean timeline operators are hoping for.

“There’s an appreciation for trying to fast-track things, but the process right now is muddled, not simple and straightforward,” said Ski NH president Jessyca Keeler.

Jarnot heard a different take from his clients: “The tone of business friendliness going on is absolutely driving the Forest Service to put the pedal to the metal on some projects and move them forward.”

For SE Group senior environmental planning associate Scott Prior, the economics are straightforward. “When considered against the rising cost of infrastructure, materials, or simply not being able to get returns on a project for a longer amount of time, the increase in fees to complete NEPA review seem negligible,” he said. “I would expect that most ski resorts would happily pay additional fees on the permitting process to save on other costs down the road.”

Clean energy and EV incentives. The OBBB speeds up the phaseout of clean energy and EV credits, rolling them back years earlier than the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act envisioned.

For Powdr, the rollback won’t stop clean energy investment but will change the math. “Powdr and our resorts will continue to facilitate EV charging, regardless of incentives,” said VP of sustainability Raj Basi. “We’ve used the 30 percent investment tax credit, including on a project that’s nearing completion, and we’ve tapped state incentives for other projects. But the competitive space is shifting—Blink declared bankruptcy, LG left the charger market—and that attrition almost certainly means higher prices for materials and labor.

“We’ll keep prioritizing alternative energy and EVs,” he added, “but the ROI is going to look different going forward. » Current projects aren’t affected, but it will impact how we analyze future projects and potentially their scale.”

For Ski Vermont president Molly Mahar, the bigger concern is consumer behavior. “The rollback of fleet credits will mean that it may not be as easy for our ski areas to adopt EV technology in their fleets, but the bigger impact is on the travel corridor infrastructure and consumer EV adoption,” she said.

Lost funding. “New Hampshire is an EV desert, especially in the northern and western regions where we rely on tourism,” said Keeler, elaborating on the same concern. “We worked with the state’s Department of Transportation and Department of Environmental Services last fall to include several ski areas, and more than 30 businesses in all, in a $15 million Charging and Fueling Infrastructure community grant proposal that would have covered about 80 percent of the cost of installing level 2 chargers at these businesses around the state. It was approved by the Biden administration in early January and then pulled by the Trump administration just a few weeks later.

“Any funding or policies to encourage EV charging installations are important to New Hampshire,” she continued, “because we’ve estimated the state could lose $1.4 billion in tourism by 2031 if EV drivers simply stop coming because there’s no charging infrastructure.”

State budgets. Looking more broadly, cuts in the OBBB to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will have state-level budget impacts. “It’s still early to tell how the state budget is going to work out or if we’ll have a gap in funding,” Mahar said. “If there’s a gap, the money has to come from somewhere—maybe higher business or homeowner taxes, or fewer services.”

The state-level uncertainty may move businesses toward caution rather than bullishness, as they wait to see how things will shake out.

Beyond the Bill

Tariffs and inflation. The major destabilizers right now continue to be tariffs and inflation. “Unpredictability is definitely causing heartburn,” said Keeler. “Tariffs are driving up costs of construction, where even a two percent increase is painful; this is much higher. Everyone is affected.”

“A contact told me the cost of an average ski lift has increased 40 percent since Covid,” said resort adviser and analyst Tom Lithgow.

Rick Schmitz, co-owner of Little Switzerland, Crystal Ridge, and Nordic Mountain in Wisconsin, has felt the increase firsthand. “Fixed-grip lifts have doubled in price in the last ten years, a much faster rate than inflation.

“The price of ski area infrastructure has increased astronomically in the last five years, and I don’t think it’s going to slow down,” he continued. “Even if the economy or tariffs improve, prices generally don’t come back down.”

Jensen sees a likely outcome: “Whether it’s lifts or snowcats or snowmaking, equipment will be subject to tariffs. Manufacturers might try to absorb some of it, but more and more businesses are passing that cost on to the end user.”

Implications for the guests. “The industry has always been very sensitive about pricing,” said Jensen. “But with tariffs and inflationary pressure, it’s that much more challenging to figure out an operating plan that meets everybody’s needs without pushing too much onto the guest.

“The customer base the ski industry enjoys tends to be resilient,” he added. “Even in economic downturns, the impact on the ski industry has been modest. But as pricing increases, and the cost of skiing increases, are people deciding to take a pass for a year or two or spend less money on winter recreation?”

The cost of money. Another cost driver: “It’s really hard to get financing for big projects right now,” said Jensen. “Lenders have become very conservative. The cost of money to them is higher, so it gets passed on to you.”

“Many of the institutional lenders have backed out of the industry,” Lithgow agreed. “Finding the money is the challenge.

“For the big guys, it’s happy days,” he added. “The Alterras and Vails of the world fill up the lift manufacturers’ queue every year. Smaller operators don’t have the same access to capital, so they’re left behind.”

That limited access is not new, of course. “It’s been harder to access capital for the last 15 years,” said Lithgow. “After the 2008 collapse, institutional lenders pulled back and businesses had to keep bigger cash reserves. A lot of operators turned to local banks for bigger projects, but overall capital availability shrank.”

The Fed cut rates a quarter percentage point in September and has signaled support for additional cuts, which could help. “The federal interest rate cut will help make accessing funds a little more affordable,” Mahar said. “There’s a lot going on right now, so it’s still early to know the full impact.”

Pushing ahead. For Schmitz, who tries to self-fund as much as possible, the lesson is clear: “Waiting to do capex projects is not going to pay off. Three years from now we may not do something because we can’t afford it. Any time I’ve stretched our business to pay for bigger capex projects, we’re generally very happy that we did. We always look back and say, ‘why didn’t we do it sooner?’

“We just finished a two-million-dollar lodge at Nordic that we’d been saving for over five years,” continued Schmitz. “If I had built it three or four years ago, it would have cost 25 percent less and I could have secured a two percent loan instead of today’s much higher rates. But I don’t want to look back three years from now and wish I’d done it.”

To that end, he’s also borrowing money for two new chairlifts, “because we need them,” he said.

Despite high costs and uncertainty, hitting the pause button isn’t much of an option. “The reality is every resort has a business plan and capital investment is always part of it,” Jensen said. “You don’t buy a chairlift you don’t need.”

On the upside, akin to dealing with the fluctuations of winter weather: “Our industry is really good at tolerating uncertainty and managing through it,” Jarnot noted.",https://www.saminfo.com/images/issues/Nov._25/Reconciliation_Nov_25.png,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:02.250839

Negotiators from nearly 200 countries have gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the annual international climate change conference—known this year as COP30—in an effort to advance global climate solutions. University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) experts are available to comment.

CLIMATE ACTION

Jonathan Overpeck, professor and dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability, is an expert on climate and weather extremes, sea-level rise, and the impacts of climate change and options for dealing with it. He served as lead author on the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 and 2014 reports.

“COP30 needs to continue the acceleration of climate action globally in several important ways. The first is to be clear that the goal of global decarbonization is more important than ever, and that every country needs to increase efforts to transition to low-carbon energy. The second is to strengthen efforts by wealthy countries who have contributed the most to climate change to help low- and middle-income countries decarbonize their energy systems and mobility. And the third is for wealthy countries to increase their ‘loss and damage’ funding to help low- and middle-income countries recover from the increasing rate of disasters due to the global climate change they did little to cause.

“Despite a new fossil fuel-friendly administration, the U.S. continues to deploy low-carbon energy and mobility solutions. These solutions are becoming more affordable and less polluting than fossil fuels everywhere around the globe, and COP30 needs to make it clear that the nations of the world are committed to halting climate change and helping those who need assistance. Climate action must continue to accelerate even more starting with COP30.”

Greg Keoleian is a professor of environment and sustainability and co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems and of MI Hydrogen, U-M’s hydrogen initiative. He develops life-cycle models to analyze decarbonization pathways and accelerate sustainability solutions for clean energy transitions, alternative vehicle technologies, buildings and infrastructure, and food systems.

“Lack of participation by high-level officials from the White House is irresponsible and represents a major setback for COP30 and climate action. Climate change is a global threat and requires international cooperation and trust. The Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement and has attacked multiple policies that curb climate pollution. Deeply rooted in the president’s false declaration that ‘climate change is a hoax,’ there has been a major assault on science-based policy and climate action. Challenges to the Endangerment Finding, termination of EV tax credits and stoppage of offshore wind farm developments highlight just a few examples.

“Despite the White House’s alarming actions, industry, state and local governments, NGOs, communities and individual households are continuing to play a vital role in implementing solutions to curb climate pollution. These stakeholders are continuing to stand up for climate along with the other national governments committed to COP30.”

Kai Zhu, associate professor of environment and sustainability, examines the ecological responses to climate change, with a particular focus on biodiversity. His recent study highlights the rapid shifts in grassland communities driven by climate change, offering crucial insights for restoration strategies and conservation efforts in these ecosystems.

“This past year, we have witnessed record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and floods, which highlight that climate change is not a distant threat but a present-day crisis. To tackle these escalating impacts, we must urgently focus on both mitigation (reducing emissions and conserving carbon-storing ecosystems) and adaptation (supporting communities and biodiversity in adjusting to rapidly changing conditions). Scientific evidence demonstrates that healthy, resilient ecosystems play a crucial role in both strategies. It is more important than ever to invest in solutions that protect both nature and people, ensuring a sustainable future as climate risks intensify.”

Mike Shriberg, professor of practice and engagement in environment and sustainability, directs the U-M Water Center. He is an expert on environmental policy and planning, with a focus on the intersection of water and climate issues.

“The way many people in the region and around the world are experiencing the impact of climate change is through changes in water access, availability and variability. Our water cycle is changing rapidly, leading to increasing flooding, drought and other forms of extreme weather. The impacts for people, communities and wildlife are extreme.

“The COP process represents our best chance to turn the tide globally and to head off the increasingly severe water-based impacts of climate change. While we can’t stop the changes already taking place and those already destined to happen due to current emissions, we can lower the consequences and move toward a more resilient and equitable future through making and following through on global commitments to reduce pollution and fund adaptive measures.”

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

Tony Reames, associate professor of environment and sustainability, founded the Urban Energy Justice Lab and the Energy Equity Project and currently serves as director of the U-M SEAS Detroit Sustainability Clinic. His research centers on advancing fair and equitable access to affordable, reliable and clean energy, and on examining the root causes and persistence of energy disparities across race, income and geography. Prior to joining U-M, he was a presidential appointee in the Biden administration, serving in several senior roles within the U.S. Department of Energy, including deputy director for energy justice.

“The hope for climate and environmental justice activists and advocates is that COP30 becomes a real opportunity to translate pledges into real action. COP30 appears to be making climate and environmental justice central themes, focusing on community-led adaptation, increased financing, the protection of environmental defenders, and greater inclusion and participation of marginalized communities, Indigenous peoples and civil society in climate negotiations and decision-making.

“The Justice and Human Rights thematic day at COP will continue the growing emphasis on integrating justice and human rights into climate action discussions. Although the U.S. government has pulled back from climate action and environmental justice under the Trump administration, these issues maintain salience on the global stage. Despite this shift in federal posture, the hundreds of state and local leaders and other attendees representing the U.S. will highlight that many Americans and decision-makers remain committed to climate and environmental justice aligned policies.”

Regulators in Kansas and Michigan approved large load tariffs on Thursday that set rules for Evergy Kansas and Consumers Energy, respectively, to connect data centers and other energy-intensive customers to the grid.

At the same time, lawmakers in Delaware — part of the PJM Interconnection — are considering legislation that would require large loads to get permission from the Delaware Public Service Commission to connect to the grid.

In part, the new rules in Kansas and Michigan and the legislation in Delaware aim to ensure that existing utility customers don’t pay costs related to interconnecting large loads.

The moves come as PJM is considering rules for interconnecting data centers and other large loads, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is beginning a rulemaking process that could lead to requirements for connecting to the federally regulated transmission system.

Kansas regulators OK Evergy rules

On Thursday, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a settlement agreement between Evergy’s Kansas utilities, the Data Center Coalition, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Google and other groups. The agreement establishes a large load “power service rate plan” for new facilities over 75 MW.

Evergy was working with more than 20 potential large load data center and manufacturing customers totaling more than 6 GW of demand, according to the company’s mid-February application with the KCC. Across its service territory in Kansas and Missouri, Evergy has a roughly 15 GW large load pipeline, including about 5 GW in advanced stages, according to an earnings presentation.

Under the large load rate plan, customers can start with up to five years of a rampup period, and then must take service for at least 12 years. Other provisions require customers to pay a minimum monthly bill based on 80% of contract demand, even if they use less than that. They must also pay for any transmission upgrades that are needed to serve their facilities.

KCC staff estimates that customers using the large load rate will pay 7% to 10% more than existing industrial customers, according to the commission’s order.

“On an annual power bill of $200 million, that extra 7-10% can significantly reduce costs that would otherwise be borne by the rest of Evergy’s customers,” the KCC said.

The agreement also includes four options for large load customers to access clean energy.

“This settlement ensures that large energy users share responsibility for the infrastructure they require while also creating new opportunities to move the grid toward clean, renewable energy,” said Sarah Rubenstein, an attorney with Great Rivers Environmental Law Center, which represented the Sierra Club.

Michigan PSC approves Consumers’ rules

Meanwhile, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved Consumers Energy’s proposal to set rules for new data centers and other loads larger than 100 MW.

The new rules set a 15-year minimum contract term, require customers to pay 80% of their expected monthly demand, regardless of how much they use, and a ramp-up period of up to five years to reach full service levels, among other things.

The PSC required Consumers Energy to show that costs caused by each new large load user are not being subsidized by other customers.

In approving the rules, the PSC said it aimed to ensure that large load customers “fully pay for the costs needed to serve them, and that there are adequate guardrails in place to avoid both cross-subsidization from other customers and the risk of stranded assets should the anticipated load fail to fully materialize.”

Consumers Energy has a 9-GW pipeline of potential data center, semiconductor and manufacturing projects, including about 4 GW to 5 GW in “advanced” discussions and 1 GW to 2 GW in “final” stages, the utility’s parent company, CMS Energy, said in a Friday investor presentation.

Delaware lawmakers eye large load rules

In Delaware, lawmakers are considering a bill — S.B. 205 — that would require the Delaware PSC to issue a “certificate to operate” for new loads larger than 30 MW that interconnect with the transmission system. The bill gives the PSC the authority to require new loads to procure generation to meet their needs and to make financial commitments to cover their transmission costs.

Lawmakers could begin reviewing the bill when the Delaware General Assembly convenes in January.

It is unclear how the bill could interact with FERC’s rulemaking to consider a U.S. Department of Energy proposal that would set rules for interconnecting large loads to the transmission system.

It’s clear to everyone Texas Tech isn’t just the favorite to win the Big 12, it’s a team situated from a talent perspective to win games in January.
What the Big 12 actually needs is a team to win deep into the CFP and earn some national respect.
Penn State: While watching Penn State give Indiana everything it could handle, I couldn’t help but think about James Franklin.
UConn has more wins over ACC teams (3) than Florida State (2) the last two seasons.","A lot happens on college football Saturdays. It’s hard to keep up with everything.

So this season, in an attempt to bring everybody up to speed — while taking a chance to provide you with some takes in the process — I’m going to rattle off over-arching thoughts from the previous weekend. I’ll also do my best to spring thoughts forward, not just tell you what already happened.

Let’s keep it going with the latest edition of Unfiltered Takes.

1. Texas Tech: The Red Raiders played a huge game against a previously undefeated BYU team Saturday. The Cougars didn’t have a chance. Texas Tech’s defense smothered them in a 29-7 win, making it feel like there were two classes of teams on the field in Lubbock. In reality, that’s what it is. Texas Tech is far and away more talented than anyone else in the conference, and it got this way because a booster invested in the roster this offseason as if it were an SEC school. That booster, oil tycoon Cody Campbell, has gotten what he paid for. It’s clear to everyone Texas Tech isn’t just the favorite to win the Big 12, it’s a team situated from a talent perspective to win games in January.

2. The Big 12: If Texas Tech wins the Big 12 — and it seems very likely that’s what’s coming — this will be a one-bid league. But I was thinking about what commissioner Brett Yormark said at conference media days in the summer. He said he wanted a few teams to be consistently good, to separate from the pack and be respected as legit national contenders. It was almost like he was challenging the conference to replace Texas and Oklahoma by promoting from within. That sounded crazy at the time, but maybe it’s happening with Tech? Maybe Tech’s success will prompt other wealthy boosters at rival Big 12 schools to replicate what Campbell is doing? What the Big 12 actually needs is a team to win deep into the CFP and earn some national respect. It has to prove it isn’t a second-class citizen. Texas Tech, truly, has a chance to do that this season.

3. Indiana: Indiana has made blowouts so common the past two years, it felt easy deciding to lay more than 20 points on the road at Penn State. Perhaps it was too easy. The Hoosiers, who have played two close games all season, found themselves on the ropes in State College. Down by four in the game’s final minutes, the Hoosiers marched down the field and scored a thrilling go-ahead touchdown to steal the game. Penn State has been an absolute train wreck this year, so many viewed that game as the Hoosiers proving their mortality. It gave people reason to doubt Curt Cignetti‘s team again. For me, I found it to be quite impressive. Penn State, though a failure this year, has a lot of NFL players on its roster and Indiana found a way to win a game in a tough environment on the road. That should help the Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff. Every game can’t be a blowout, and I find it amusing people are ready to jump off the Indiana bandwagon the second it plays a close game. Everybody plays close games.

4. Fernando Mendoza: Was that quarterback Fernando Mendoza‘s Heisman moment? Funny enough, he was the second-most impressive player on the game-winning touchdown play. Indiana receiver Omar Cooper had the catch of the year on that game-winning grab. But people love resilient quarterbacks, ones who rise up and get wins when things are going poorly. Mendoza has been climbing up the NFL Draft mock boards during the last month, but it felt like that moment at Penn State — with the entire country watching — was when he took a step into college football stardom. He should be the favorite to win the Heisman right now.

5. Penn State: While watching Penn State give Indiana everything it could handle, I couldn’t help but think about James Franklin. How did it get so dire? How did things fall apart so quickly for one of the nation’s most consistent programs? It felt like losing to Oregon at home in overtime completely broke him. That didn’t need to be the case. This is still a team that has the second-most NFL talent of any Big Ten roster. Nick Singleton, who scored three touchdowns against Indiana, is so good. This is the era where losing one or two games in the regular season doesn’t crush your hopes. Even if Penn State would have stayed together, beaten UCLA and Northwestern and even lost to Ohio State, it absolutely could have beaten Indiana and gone to the CFP. This team was always going to be judged by what it did in the postseason, anyway. The roster tapped out a month too early, which is the reason Franklin is currently unemployed. It’s a shame what happened to this team. It had so much promise.

6. Oregon: Since Oregon lost by 10 at home to Indiana a month ago, the Ducks have fallen out of the national conversation. Maybe part of that was because it took overtime to beat Penn State, a team most don’t view as capable. However, Dante Moore led the Ducks on a game-winning drive after being dragged into Iowa hell. Moore had a 24-yard strike to receiver Malik Benson down the sideline in pourous conditions to set up a game-winning field goal. That Moore throw may have been as impressive of a “Heisman moment” as the one Mendoza had hours earlier. Oregon is walking in the shadows because it hasn’t really beaten up teams this year, but this Ducks team is every bit of a national title contender as a Georgia or Ole Miss.

7. Georgia: Georgia came into the weekend having won three games in a row it could have lost. It has made it easy to doubt this Bulldogs team, one that seems susceptible to losing again. That’s why Mississippi State was a trendy pick this week to keep things close in Starkville. Nope. Georgia absolutely demolished a much-improved Bulldogs team, showing the world that even if this team isn’t as dominant as some of the past Kirby Smart teams, it’s still very much a legit national title contender. There is so much football still left to be played, but it was a reminder that it’s hard to get rich doubting Georgia. Is the defense good enough to win it all?

8. Texas: I moved Texas back into my top 10 this week after the Longhorns won four in a row, two of which over teams ranked in the top 10 at the time. What is Texas? Is it a team with a bad offensive line that has masked that overt deficiency during the last month? Or is this a loaded roster finding itself at the right time and is very much alive in the SEC and national title races? Quarterback Arch Manning, who some were labeling a bust four weeks ago, has thrown for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns in consecutive games. Is he arriving right before our eyes? Thankfully, Texas is going to Georgia on Saturday for what should be the SEC showdown we were all anticipating this offseason. That’s going to be a game that provides a ton of context as the postseason picture continues to crystalize.

9. The ACC: Saturday didn’t feel like a dramatic day, but the ACC caught on fire. No. 14 Virginia lost to Wake Forest after quarterback Chandler Morris left the game in the second quarter. Around the same time, Cal finished a thrilling overtime win over No. 15 Louisville. Down by three in OT, Cal went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 3. Cal freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele hit receiver Jacob De Jesus on a little rub route for the score, closing a 29-26 win. Now the ACC standings feature five random teams with only one loss in conference play. None of those five teams are Miami, Florida State or Clemson. What a bizarre year.

10. Mike Norvell: There was a moment during Florida State‘s 24-10 loss to Clemson when the broadcast zoomed in on Seminoles head coach Mike Norvell. The man had a blank stare on his face, almost as if he were reflecting on how things got so bad so quickly. There are obviously going to be rumors every week from now until the end of the season about him being fired. Rightfully so. How much worse can it get? This feels like rock bottom. And while moving on from him is going to be expensive, we’re getting to the point where the Seminoles just don’t have a choice. This isn’t a competitive football team.

11. Miami: Miami beat Syracuse 38-10 on Saturday and Hurricanes fans were sitting on the edges of their seats watching ACC leaders lose to underdogs. Though you’d need a mathematician to try to figure out ACC tiebreakers, Miami is dreaming of situations where it can backdoor its way to Charlotte. Here’s the thing: I actually think 10-2 Miami is an at-large team in the CFP, regardless of whether it wins or even plays for the ACC title. Last year, 10-2 Miami was left out. But this year’s team has something valuable last year’s team didn’t posses: a top-10 win. Miami still has to win out, which may feel like a tough proposition, but I believe the Hurricanes are in a good spot for CFP contention still.

12. Duke: Duke is 5-4, but is one of the five teams who only have one loss in ACC play. That’s what happens when you lose three nonconference games. What if Duke wins the ACC? What if a four-loss team is the ACC champ? The Blue Devils still have to beat Virginia, North Carolina and Wake Forest and whoever it faces in a hypothetical matchup in Charlotte. But if Duke does it, will the CFP Committee automatically take Duke or does that open the door for two Group of 5 conference champions instead? Could we see a CFP without the ACC champion but Miami as an at large? Wild times.

13. The American: Friday night was a pivotal game in the America race. Tulane played at Memphis and the Tigers, who faced a 21-point deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter, had the ball down six multiple times late in the game. Memphis ultimately couldn’t complete the comeback — like the one it pulled off against USF — and Tulane escaped with the win. The American is situated like the ACC at the top of the standings, with five teams having one loss. Those five teams are Navy, South Florida, Tulane, North Texas and East Carolina. The winner of that conference will make the CFP.

14. Jim Mora: Want to hear a wild stat that was floating around social media Saturday? UConn has more wins over ACC teams (3) than Florida State (2) the last two seasons. That isn’t just piling on Norvell more. It’s a way to compliment UConn coach Jim Mora, who led the Huskies to a win over Duke on Saturday. UConn was 10-50 the previous five seasons before Mora took over in 2022, a laughingstock of a program. Now the Huskies, 7-3, are 25-23 under Mora’s leadership. Does that turnaround get the former UCLA head coach some looks during the coaching carousel? What he has done there is tremendous and it’s time we start showing appreciation of a job well done.

15. USC: Guess who is still alive in the CFP race? Lincoln Riley‘s USC. After beating Northwestern 38-17 on Friday night, the Trojans improved to 7-2. They have three games left in its regular season — Iowa, Oregon and UCLA. If USC wins all three of those games — which certainly doesn’t feel impossible with Jayden Maiava, Ja’Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon hitting on all cylinders — it could be a legit CFP at-large selection. If USC beats Iowa next weekend (which isn’t easy), we’re going to get a vintage Pac-12 brawl between the Trojans and Oregon. Who doesn’t love West Coast nostalgia?

16. USC’s fake punt: Early in the second quarter of USC’s win Friday, the Trojans faced a fourth-and-6 from their own 46-yard line. The punter, wearing No. 80, threw a dart to receiver Tanook Hines for a 10-yard completion and first down. Guess what? The player wearing No. 80 was backup quarterback Sam Huard, who swapped his jersey with the punter and went into the game. USC doesn’t have name plates on the back of its jerseys. The Big Ten ruled Sunday that there should have been a penalty when the real punter came into the game later. The whole thing felt sleazy to me.

17. Notre Dame: USC winning games is good for Notre Dame, as the Trojans are still the Irish’s best win. Notre Dame blew out Navy on Saturday to improve to 7-2. After dropping its first two games of the season, it has won seven in a row and now has matchups with Pitt, Syracuse and Stanford on deck. Though playing Pitt on the road may be tricky, it seems likely the Irish will finish 10-2. Though I was confused by their No. 10 ranking Tuesday evening, it seems like all but a certainty the Irish will get into the field as long as they dont lose another one. USC winning is helping, too.

18. Wisconsin: Wisconsin AD Chris McIntosh announced Thursday Badgers coach Luke Fickell will return in 2026, which is kind of surprising given how much of a dumpster fire the program has been under his leadership. But if Fickell wasn’t given the proper resources to compete, which McIntosh acknowledged, maybe the program’s regression isn’t Fickell’s fault? Funny enough, two days later, Wisconsin beat Washington at home, 13-10, despite being down to its fourth quarterback of the season. That was an emotional win for a Badgers team and staff that haven’t gotten to enjoy much the last few years.

19. Luke Fickell: The most confusing thing about Fickell’s leadership of the Wisconsin program is how few good players he has brought in. He hasn’t done a good enough job recruiting the legacy Wisconsin offensive linemen and he certainly hasn’t done a good enough job signing elite-level skill positon players to improve this team’s explosiveness. Regardless of whether you’re for or against Fickell’s retention, I think we’ll know whether it was his fault or not after the portal season.

Over the period between April and September, power output from hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar installations accounted for 31.3% of the total, up from 27.1% a year earlier. Of that, large hydropower plants booked a 13.2% increase in generation, while the rest of the low-carbon capacity, excluding nuclear, posted an increase of 23.4%, the data showed. Nuclear power output booked a decline of 3.7% on the year.

The report noted that India’s installed capacity of non-hydrocarbon generation sources had topped 250 GW, which is half of the planned 500 GW in total by 2030. Of that, 127 GW was solar capacity and 53 GW was wind capacity.

India has significant ambitions in non-hydrocarbon generation, but a recent update to power market rules may interfere with developers’ plans. The changes concern mandates for power supply deliveries to the grid, essentially obliging wind and solar operators to supply exactly as much as they say they would supply, as do conventional power generators.

This prompted a reaction from the wind power industry, Reuters reported earlier this month, with executives warning this could hurt their bottom lines since their output depends on the weather and cannot be changed at will. The same is true of solar installations.

Earlier this month, the chairman of the Central Electricity Authority warned that the surge in wind and solar installations was leading to soaring transmission costs as the country's transmission network is being built on estimates of potential renewable power generation, not on actual capacity or demand.

India was struggling to accommodate the massive wind and solar capacity buildout, which could lead to developers installing renewable energy generation capacity that cannot be transmitted or sold, Ghanshyam Prasad explained, adding that the country needed to continue investing in baseload generation capacity as well in order to maintain grid stability.

By dismantling agencies and budgets, it undermines the US’s capacity to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis. There is no way to put a positive spin on it. A future Democratic administration will need consecutive terms in office to reverse the carnage. Paul Hockenos reports.

In less than 100 days, the cuts and closures reversed just about all of the Biden administration climate and renewable energy measures, as well as much of the environmental bulwark established by previous Republican and Democratic governments. This is a structural shift away from federal leadership in renewables buildout, climate science, adaptation, conservation, and regulation. The blitzkrieg heaps doubt on hard climate science and bets everything on the expansion of fossil fuel and nuclear energy as the way forward. They, not renewables, are boosted with federal lands and hundreds of millions in subsidies.

‘Through executive orders, agency memos and other policy moves,’ reports The Guardian, ‘the Trump administration has deleted a swath of Joe Biden-era green policies, frozen climate spending, removed the US from the Paris climate accords, and set about rewriting pollution standards for cars, trucks, and power plants.’

In the administration’s first hundred days, it took 145 actions against environmental laws. ‘The deregulatory ambition of this administration is mind-blowing. This is the most anti-environmental administration that our country and perhaps the world has ever seen,’ said longtime environmentalist and author Bill McKibben. The Trump administration’s budget law – the so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ – is, according to a Heinrich Böll Stiftung report, a back door to implementing major portions of the MAGA agenda. It could become one of the most destructive, anti-climate, anti-poor and anti-working-class pieces of legislation in US history, it concludes.

Renewables

The solar, wind and grid-integration programmes that the Biden administration put into law are being zeroed out or dramatically reduced. The current budget eliminates tax incentives for solar, wind, battery storage and other clean energy technologies. These incentives, created under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), were a driving force behind the rapid expansion of the clean tech sector in the US – in Republican states as well as Democratic. ‘The bill repeals several landmark consumer incentives from the IRA, such as the 7,500 US dollar federal electric vehicle tax credit, and subsidies for residential solar and heat pump installation,’ according to the Böll report.

Climate science

At the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025, Trump blasted climate science as the ‘greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world’ and claimed that ‘stupid people’ forged the scientific consensus on global warming. As it trashes climate science as a ‘hoax’, the government is slashing a third of the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the scientific and regulatory agency charged with forecasting weather, and monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Climate research programmes are being terminated. Although the administration wants to eliminate NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the bill is currently in Congress, where it is facing fightback from both parties.

Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Programme, ‘the country’s most comprehensive way to track the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming the planet’ (according to the New York Times) has also been terminated.

The Trump administration has also purged government websites. It has removed the term ‘climate change’ and deleted webpages about climate impacts. Mandated scientific reports have been pulled from publication.

Climate adaptation

And then there’s the elimination or scaling back of programmes that help communities prepare and respond to climate-related disasters. Programmes that help coastal communities adapt to rising seas and increased storms are on the chopping block, as are the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) programmes for disaster preparedness and recovery, and the construction of resilient infrastructure, such as storm-proofing of schools, hospitals and police stations. The Office of Community Planning and Development, which handles disaster recovery, is losing over three-quarters of its staff. Moreover, cuts to water infrastructure and clean water revolving funds reduce the capacity for municipalities to prepare for and respond to climate‐driven changes, such as more extreme precipitation and flooding.

Regulation

The rollbacks and evisceration of regulation fall squarely within the administration’s pledges to give business and industry much greater leeway to seek profit. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, has proposed to repeal findings that establish that greenhouse gases like CO₂ endanger public health and welfare. This is the legal foundation under the Clean Air Act for many climate and emissions regulations. Reversing it would remove or weaken the EPA’s authority to regulate emissions from power plants, vehicles and landfills. The administration is also targeting rules limiting tailpipe emissions and other vehicle standards that were intended to push automakers toward more electric vehicles or stricter efficiency.

In September, the New York Times reported that the EPA will no longer hold thousands of polluting facilities responsible to report the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that their facilities emit. The EPA proposal, writes the New York Times, ‘would end requirements for thousands of coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial facilities across the country’. The government has been collecting this data since 2010, and it is a key tool to track carbon dioxide, methane and other gases that are driving climate change.

Contrary to the dire warnings of economists, the president thinks he can revive the coal and oil industries with grants of over USD 600 million and the opening of over 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining.

Neither the opposition Democrats nor non-governmental institutions in the US have been able to slow the Trump juggernaut on climate. The best hope for a perch to do so is the US midterms on 3 November 2026, when the Democrats will have the chance to flip both the House and the Senate. Thus far, however, the restoration of climate protection has not been prominent on its banners.

The path forward is clear: creating a clear, predictable regulatory environment enables a future where Texas energy can fuel American progress.","By Ed Longanecker

In a new directive from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will initiate rulemaking procedures to address the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system in a “timely, orderly and non-discriminatory manner.”

In his letter, Wright affirms the Administration’s commitment to revitalizing domestic manufacturing and driving American AI innovation, both of which will require “unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity…”

To meet that level of demand, affordable, reliable, and dispatchable fuels like natural gas will be the backbone of AI deployment. Natural gas generation can ramp up quickly to handle the fluctuating demands of data centers, where even brief interruptions could corrupt massive AI training runs or halt real-time inferences. This on-demand flexibility sets it apart from variable other energy sources, providing the steady, 24/7 baseload power that AI infrastructure relies on.

Without natural gas, the rapid scaling of artificial intelligence could stall, handing advantages to global competitors. Texas’ leadership in natural gas production positions the state as the ideal supplier for this surge, ensuring American technologies stay ahead with energy that’s deployable and resilient.

Texas and the Permian have been leaders in meeting energy demand over the past twenty years and will continue to be critical in meeting this new era of economic growth. In a recent Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that both natural gas output and demand would hit record highs in 2025 as a result of strong domestic consumption and increased LNG exports

Data centers running large language models and training neural networks require high volumes of power. A single hyperscale facility can draw as much power as a small city – in fact, a large data center load like the one Secretary Wright references in his letter is equal to about to 20 megawatts (MW), the same amount of electric power consumed by 16,500 U.S. homes. Multiply that by the dozens of new centers tech giants’ plans to build amid the AI race, and the grid faces a historic test.

Texas is able to meet that demand, pumping more oil and natural gas than any other state, producing approximately 28% of the nation’s natural gas (over 12.7 trillion cubic feet in 2024 alone), with 2025 outputs climbing even higher, some reaching up to 36.9 billion cubic feet per day in recent months.

Month after month, the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale churn out the fuel that light homes, power factories, and now stand ready to feed the ravenous appetite of AI.

Delivering that amount of energy also requires an efficient and predictable permitting process that supports the construction of new natural gas power plants, transmission lines and pipelines with sufficient capacity. Texas has been successful in getting new projects, like the Matterhorn pipeline, built and online in recent years, but greater predictability is still needed on the federal level.

Innovations in the Lone Star State like Project Horizon, a data center in West Texas that is right next to a natural gas production and processing facility, are setting an example for what an efficient and predictable permitting process could deliver across the country.

Secretary Wright and FERC, through its powers enacted by Congress, have the ability to create new standards that will bring efficiency and predictability to the process, allowing for the quick and necessary construction of critical energy infrastructure.

As Texas continues to lead the way in energy production, these regulatory improvements will ensure that our state’s formidable natural gas resources will continue to power innovation while delivering economic benefits. The path forward is clear: creating a clear, predictable regulatory environment enables a future where Texas energy can fuel American progress.

Today, COP30 is bringing together in Belém, Brazil, from 10 to 21 November 2025, the various actors of climate governance in a tense geopolitical context, marked by the rise of anti-environmental populism and the erosion of multilateralism. At this point of stocktaking, the aim is less to oppose successes and failures than to assess the capacity of the international system to mobilise in the face of the climate emergency.

A discussion with Mathilde Jourde, researcher at IRIS, head of the Climate, Environment and Security Programme.

What is the retrospective since the adoption of the Paris Agreement?

Since 1992, the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have been the annual meeting of the Convention’s member states to review progress and determine the measures to be implemented for the years ahead.

Often described in binary terms as “successes” or “failures”, the COPs are frequently subject to a reductive reading that obscures their real progress. Yet several notable advances can be highlighted over the past ten years. COP26 stood out for its call for the gradual reduction of electricity generation from coal. COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, was a historic milestone as it endorsed, for the first time, the creation of a “loss and damage” fund to support the most vulnerable countries. COP28, held in Dubai, concluded with a call for a gradual transition away from fossil fuels. Finally, COP29 led to an agreement on a new quantified goal (NCQG) for climate finance for developing countries, to support their efforts to tackle climate change.

At the same time, these international negotiations have translated into progress at national level. In terms of public policy, more than 100 countries have announced carbon neutrality targets since COP21, often accompanied by national climate strategies – such as the European Green Deal. Through a spillover effect, these national policies have also delivered concrete results, such as the spectacular fall in the cost of low-carbon technologies, which has dropped by 60 to 90% since 2010.

Highlighting this progress does not mean ignoring its limits – whether in terms of overly communicative approaches, lack of ambition or insufficient implementation. It does, however, serve as a reminder that these processes remain genuinely useful. A study by World Weather Attribution showed that, before the Paris Agreement was signed, “global greenhouse gas emissions were following a trend that would have led to an increase in the planet’s average temperature of at least 4°C by 2100 compared to the pre-industrial era. Now, global warming is on a +2.6°C trajectory.”

Far from being sufficient, this study nonetheless illustrates the progress made and shows that the defeatism and disillusionment often associated with international climate negotiations should be qualified. All the more so since the fight against climate disruption is not a binary matter: every tenth of a degree counts. Every fraction of warming avoided helps to mitigate, at least a little, the potentially devastating impacts.

Ten years on, what lessons can be drawn from COP29 and what is at stake at COP30?

One of the fundamental differences between COP29 and COP30 lies in the international context. COP29, held last year in Baku, was already taking place against a complicated geopolitical backdrop. The consequences for climate diplomacy were tangible – relations between France and Azerbaijan were badly strained and Emmanuel Macron did not attend; Donald Trump had just been re-elected with the aim of once again withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement; and several major leaders – Ursula von der Leyen, Olaf Scholz, Joe Biden – were absent. Yet this COP was crucial to reaffirm the importance of climate issues despite international tensions, and could have demonstrated their unifying potential. Many topics were to be addressed, but the NCQG issue monopolised a significant share of the discussions, to the detriment of mitigation, adaptation or gender issues, for instance. The agreement on the NCQG was strongly criticised by developing countries, which had indicated the need to mobilise 1,300 billion dollars by 2035, whereas the amount adopted was 300 billion. Some progress was also made on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which defines the mechanisms of the carbon market, but the way it was adopted – without genuine debate – drew criticism.

The COP currently being held in Belém is set to be highly symbolic. Brazil wants to make this COP, convened in the heart of the Amazon, the COP for forest preservation, while also highlighting the role of indigenous peoples. COP30 will also be highly political: marking ten years of the Paris Agreement, it must reaffirm the credibility of climate multilateralism at a moment of great geopolitical uncertainty. Central issues will include the new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – that is, states’ climate action plans – which each country must update in light of the 2023 Global Stocktake. Discussions must also continue on the implementation of Article 6, in particular on finalising the rules for its operationalisation. Deforestation will also be a core topic – Brazil will showcase the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund dedicated to the conservation of tropical forests. Lastly, climate finance will remain a sensitive point, as the United States has suspended its contributions and several European countries are cutting their development aid budgets.

This COP also faces numerous challenges. Logistical, first of all: the lack of infrastructure and soaring accommodation prices in Belém risk excluding certain delegations and NGOs. The challenges are also political, linked to the growing wave of anti-environmental populism and the unravelling of environmental policies in some states. This trend runs across all continents, including those historically at the forefront on climate. In the United States, attacks on climate science and environmental policies are targeting scientific production (mass lay-offs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency), climate strategies (the end of the Green New Deal and the Inflation Reduction Act) and financing (the Trump administration has ended the US contribution to the UNFCCC, i.e. 20% of the total budget). The same trend can be seen in Europe, with the gradual dismantling of certain regulations under the guise of administrative simplification. The “omnibus law” proposed by the European Commission in February 2025 aims, in particular, to “simplify” the Green Deal by easing, for example, the CSRD (reporting obligations) or the CSDDD/CS3D (corporate due diligence) frameworks. This ecological backlash is not, however, inevitable: on 22 October, the European Parliament rejected this draft law, preventing its direct adoption and opening up a new debate in plenary.

Finally, the challenge is geopolitical, as international rivalries are slowing down and fragmenting climate governance. Armed conflicts – whose number, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), rose from 30 in 1990 to 120 in 2024 – have direct impacts on ecosystems (pollution, destruction of soils and water infrastructure), but also indirect ones, by diverting financial resources towards the defence industry and the war economy, to the detriment of environmental policies, as some seek to pit investment in the energy transition against spending on defence. The correlation between higher defence budgets and greenhouse gas emissions illustrates this paradox: the more militarisation increases, the further the climate trajectory drifts away. In the long term, countries at war also display a lower environmental performance index than those in a state of “peace”.

Why is it essential to continue climate negotiations and efforts despite the challenges encountered?

COPs are indeed imperfect and sometimes lack effectiveness, but they remain absolutely essential. First, they are the only moment when global attention focuses on climate issues. Moreover, even if some states struggle to meet their climate commitments, other actors continue to stay the course and use COPs to introduce new measures – municipalities, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and civil society as a whole are actively pursuing their actions. These actors are sometimes more responsive than political bodies themselves and are adept at using alternative instruments to push states to be more ambitious. Since the Paris Agreement, the legal lever has in particular made it possible to hold certain actors to account – France, for instance, was taken to court in 2021 and then ordered to remedy the consequences of its climate inaction.

States, moreover, have every interest in continuing to engage in these forums. Beyond the obvious benefits for the planet’s habitability and for public health, international climate negotiations are also arenas of inter-state competition. Tackling climate change is a strategic tool, both to strengthen states’ positions on the international stage – for example by consolidating their credibility with other states or showcasing their climate strategies – and to increase their national resilience in the face of climate risks. China, for example, enshrined the concept of “ecological civilisation” in its Constitution in 2018, which under Xi Jinping has become a pillar of the national narrative. The Gulf monarchies are also using climate as a lever of diplomacy and diversification, having fully understood the benefits this approach can bring.",https://www.iris-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/COP30_Bresil_Belem-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:10:47.421369

HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES, November 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Utility Global (“Utility”), a U.S.-based leader in economic industrial decarbonization through innovative hydrogen solutions, and Symbio North America Corporation (“Symbio”), part of Symbio group, Europe’s largest fuel cell technology developer and manufacturer, with HQ in France, today announced that Symbio has received approval from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) for a Clean Fuels Fund grant to design, develop, and demonstrate a hydrogen fuel cell refuse collection vehicle in the South Coast Air Basin. Utility will manage and oversee the hydrogen fueling logistics and operations throughout the one-year demonstration.

Utility and Symbio have also entered into a strategic alliance to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission, hydrogen-powered refuse trucks in North America.

This collaboration tackles two major challenges facing the refuse collection sector:

1. High-performing zero-emission vehicle: Developing a hydrogen-electric refuse truck powered by Symbio’s advanced fuel cell technology that will exceed the duty cycle and payload of available battery-electric vehicles while meeting operational expectations of refuse haulers.

2. Fuel economics: Delivering economic, reliable, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen fuel from water, without electricity, using biogas (e.g., landfill gas) in Utility’s H2Gen system – a core enabler of Utility’s mission to drive economic decarbonization across heavy industries.

Together, Utility and Symbio will deliver an integrated, cost-effective solution that combines economic hydrogen supply with best-in-class vehicle performance and durability.

As part of the South Coast AQMD-funded demonstration, initial vehicle trials will begin in Southern California in collaboration with Waste Management, CR&R, and the Cities of Los Angeles and Riverside in the first half of 2026. The Clean Energy Institute at the University of California, Irvine will collect and analyze operational and performance data throughout the demonstration period to help validate the technology for future commercial scale-up.

“We support projects like this that combine advanced vehicle technology with innovative clean hydrogen solutions,” said Wayne Nastri, South Coast AQMD’s Executive Officer. “This strategic collaboration represents a meaningful step toward reducing emissions in communities across South Coast Air Basin.”

“This alliance is about turning waste into real, scalable decarbonization,” stated Parker Meeks, CEO of Utility. “By pairing Utility’s H2Gen technology – which produces economic, low-carbon hydrogen from water without electricity by utilizing the electrochemical energy in biogases such as landfill gas – alongside Symbio’s proven fuel cell systems, we can deliver a zero-emission hydrogen-electric refuse truck solution that matches diesel performance. This alliance embodies our mission of enabling economic industrial decarbonization through practical, cost-effective solutions.”

Jean-Baptiste Lucas, Symbio CEO, added, “Joining forces with Utility Global enables us to expand the reach of our fuel cell technology while supporting the growing need for sustainable transport solutions in the waste management sector.”

This non-exclusive Strategic Alliance is already effective while allowing both parties to pursue additional partnerships to further accelerate market adoption of hydrogen-electric refuse vehicles and associated scale up of decentralized hydrogen supply and infrastructure.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins.","From Inside Climate News:

BAIROIL, Wyo.—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming.

In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.

“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”

For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently re-awakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power.

Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units.

“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”

Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks.

Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products.

Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said.

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed.

In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.

Supply chain bottleneck

For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2 percent of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99 percent of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium then President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.

“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”

A flurry of new mines

In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre pit uranium mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House.

“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”

The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest.

On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.

Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern.

The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected—not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites—but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.

From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.

“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019.

Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023.

Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.

On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.

“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that—problems of the past—and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”

At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material.

“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time.

Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands.

“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain.

Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements.

Groundwater concerns

Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”

The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico.

“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them.

The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe.

“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.

“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.

The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026.

One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County.

“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year.

Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said.

The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said.

“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state.

In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment.

Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas.

The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.

Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.

Drilling uranium

On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.

Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.

“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery—ISR mining—a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five-side of dice and then injects a leachate—water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash—into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium.

Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”

But if this was an open pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility—a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.

Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.

Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects—moving “where it shouldn’t move”—four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.

“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.”

Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop.

“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

“As data centres expand, these machines are seeing renewed importance for their ability to provide inertia and short-circuit strength.","ABB has announced a major partnership with Texas-based microgrid company VoltaGrid to improve the reliability and stability of power systems supporting the rapid expansion of AI data centres in the United States.

As energy consumption surges due to AI workloads, the collaboration aims to deliver critical grid-stabilising technologies that ensure consistent, resilient power for hyperscale and modular operations.

Strengthening grid stability for AI growth

Under the agreement, ABB will supply 27 synchronous condensers with flywheels and prefabricated eHouse units that include power control, automation and excitation systems. These will integrate into VoltaGrid’s distributed energy sites currently under construction, supporting multiple AI infrastructure projects across the country.

The systems provide high inertia, stabilise voltage and strengthen grid reliability by managing reactive power across complex high-demand environments.

VoltaGrid’s proprietary natural gas-fuelled power generation technology will complement ABB’s systems, forming a hybrid energy network designed for rapid deployment. Capable of functioning as both short-term and long-term behind-the-metre solutions, the units will deliver flexible capacity for hyperscale data centres that require fast and stable power delivery.

Project delivery is expected to begin in December 2025, with the first operational units scheduled for April 2026.

“ABB’s synchronous condensers are vital for meeting the energy demands of next-generation technologies like AI data centres, thanks to their proven ability to ensure grid stability and enhance the overall resilience of power systems,” says Nathan Ough, CEO of VoltaGrid. “Partnering with ABB allows us to accelerate project execution and meet the growing performance demands of AI operations, delivering more value to our customers.”

Meeting the rising power demand from AI

The collaboration comes at a time when US data centre energy consumption continues to climb. In 2024, data centres accounted for around 1.5% of global electricity use, with the US responsible for approximately 45% of that total. Industry analysts expect data centres to drive nearly half of the country’s electricity demand growth by 2030, with AI workloads fuelling much of this expansion.

The growing demand for compute-intensive applications, including generative AI and machine learning, is straining national power grids. Maintaining stable and efficient energy delivery has therefore become one of the biggest challenges for hyperscale operators.

Technologies such as ABB’s synchronous condensers, combined with VoltaGrid’s distributed generation platforms, are emerging as key solutions to maintaining resilience while supporting AI-driven growth.

ABB’s contribution to energy resilience

ABB has been investing in power systems designed to enhance grid stability and support the transition to cleaner, more reliable energy. Its prefabricated eHouse systems are modular and transportable, enabling simplified power distribution and faster deployment of energy infrastructure for large-scale data centre and industrial applications.

“ABB is proud to partner with VoltaGrid and support the evolving energy ecosystem in the US,” says Per Erik Holsten, President of ABB’s Energy Industries division.

“Across the world, data centres are increasingly critical infrastructure and so maintaining grid stability has shifted from being optional to strategic. Delivering stable, reliable and efficient power generation is vital to enable data centre growth. Our integrated automation, electrification and digitalisation solutions play an important role to meet growing demand while maintaining energy security.”

Synchronous condensers for modern data networks

Synchronous condensers are becoming increasingly important for data centres and utilities facing grid instability caused by fluctuating renewable generation and rising load demands.

Although similar in design to large motors or generators, these systems are built to provide instantaneous inertia and short-circuit strength – both essential for maintaining grid balance and reliability.

“Synchronous condensers may resemble large motors or generators in design, but their real strength lies in grid support,” says Kristina Carlquist, Head of Synchronous Condenser Product Line at ABB’s Motion High Power division. “As data centres expand, these machines are seeing renewed importance for their ability to provide inertia and short-circuit strength. For VoltaGrid, they will help ensure reliable, resilient microgrid performance.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b27a7bd26242258bb5d0fcc4f62b2008:6f6a2dbb0c74613f672e21a20cb68629/per-erik-holsten-president-of-abb-s-energy-industries-division.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:10.376178

The development combines 600 MW of solar generation with 1,900 MWh of energy storage and moves toward commercial operation in the second half of 2027. Furthermore, the project secures a 20-year busbar agreement with Arizona Public Service (APS), which strengthens predictable cash-flow for the build and operational phases.

The financing package was provided by a consortium of six major global banks including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BNP Paribas, Natixis, Nord/LB, Crédit Agricole and MUFG Bank, Ltd. Enlight expects to secure tax-equity investment during 2026, and structure the debt such that part converts to a term loan post-commercial-operation while the remainder is paid via tax-equity proceeds.The first full year after commercial operation is forecast to generate roughly US $128 million revenue and US $104 million EBITDA.

Significance of the Project

From a construction-industry perspective, Snowflake A represents a large-scale industrial build involving major civil, structural, mechanical and electrical scopes. Contractors will engage in site-preparation works, large foundations for solar arrays and storage systems, modular equipment installation and utility-scale grid-interconnect overhead systems. Because of the energy-storage component, the project adds complexity. Additional requirements include specialized foundations, fire-protection systems, battery-containment design and high-capacity AC/DC conversions.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Project-5.avif,N,,2025-11-10 11:12:45.688724

But more than a month into the shutdown, workers at the EPA have mostly escaped the high-profile reductions in force and mass furloughs that have hit other agencies.
“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations and Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” EPA spokesperson Mike Bastasch tells WIRED in a statement.
Walter Mugdan, a multi-decade EPA employee who last served as the head of one of the agency’s regional offices, says that the EPA is likely paying employees still coming to work with carryover funds from last year’s budget.
“Could be a method to the madness, but probably just disorganization,” says one EPA employee.","WITH THE END of the US government shutdown in sight, disorganization still reigns at federal agencies. Workers at the Environmental Protection Agency tell WIRED that they have faced increasing chaos over the past five weeks.

In recent weeks, varied phases of furloughs have forced staff to go home in seemingly random waves. Some employees remaining at the agency are working on policies friendly to fossil fuel and industrial interests that are a priority of the administration, even as the rest of the government shuts down.

Others have had to sit on their hands, as the shutdown takes out colleagues with no notice—and remaining employees have little to no information as to what is coming next.

“We learn who is furloughed when we send an email to someone and get the out-of-office message, or we hover over names in Teams for people who are showing out of office,” one EPA worker tells WIRED. (This worker, and others in this story, were granted anonymity because they aren’t permitted to speak to the press.)

Some employees who are being kept are at work revising pollution rules, a core deregulatory goal of the administration. An employee at the Office of Air and Radiation confirmed to WIRED that their team, which is working on rule revisions in that office, is still being called in to work, while others in the office—including support staff like administrative assistants and operations workers—were sent home the week of October 20.

“Staff working in the regulatory part of the air office are still working,” the employee tells WIRED. “Lots of furloughs elsewhere. But we’re still working on deregulatory actions.” The New York Times reported in mid-October that other staffers working to repeal rules friendly to oil, gas, and coal interests were also being told to “press on.”

Around 4,400 employees, WIRED has learned, had been furloughed at the agency as of late October. According to the EPA’s shutdown plan, which was last updated in September, the agency employed more than 15,000 people as of October 1. In the plan, the agency lists just 1,734 employees expected to be retained in the event of a full shutdown. These employees would work on “significant agency activities” deemed crucial enough to be continued in a lapse, including Superfund activities, disaster assistance, criminal investigations, and the preservation of research.

Following a Sunday vote in the Senate, the government shutdown could end as early as this week.

OMB director Russell Vought, the public face of the government shutdown, has tried to use it as a way to further cut back the size of the federal workforce. But more than a month into the shutdown, workers at the EPA have mostly escaped the high-profile reductions in force and mass furloughs that have hit other agencies. Many workers are still coming in to do their jobs as the agency tries to continue business as usual. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, meanwhile, has squarely blamed Democrats.

“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations and Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” EPA spokesperson Mike Bastasch tells WIRED in a statement. “Congressional Democrats have chosen to shut down the government. If they want to re-open the government, they can choose to do so at any time.”

Not everyone still at EPA is working on deregulations, or even top administration priorities, however. A staffer working on civil rights cases in the administrator’s office says their team hasn’t received furlough notices, and that they are still coming in to work. “Our work is definitely not a priority of the administration,” they said.

Many employees working on the Superfund program, which is responsible for cleaning up toxic sites around the country, have also retained their jobs. A regional Superfund worker told WIRED that their team had been largely unaffected by furloughs. But even those workers are facing uncertainty.

In late October, supervisors informed the staff that if the shutdown continues, the funding source for Superfund staff paychecks would switch to a trust fund established to help finance the program, avoiding the need to furlough them entirely. But a week later, the administration had apparently changed its tune: Last week, the employee tells WIRED, leadership informed Superfund workers in their regional office that a decision had been made to not use the trust fund for payroll, and that staff should expect furloughs in the coming weeks.

“Everyone was shocked,” the employee says.

Walter Mugdan, a multi-decade EPA employee who last served as the head of one of the agency’s regional offices, says that the EPA is likely paying employees still coming to work with carryover funds from last year’s budget. (Zeldin told reporters last week that the agency has “a whole bunch of pots of carryover funding” that it was using.)

Still, multiple employees tell WIRED that the source of their paychecks has not been made clear to them. And unlike previous shutdowns, when the agency communicated clearly the timelines for how long it could stay open, workers say that they have no idea when the money will run out.

“They seem to keep finding change in the couch cushions to pay us, so who knows [what comes next],” says one employee.

The uneven furloughs have affected some employees’ work. “The scattershot furlough of regional staff is making it difficult for us to get anything done that requires input from those folks,” says the civil rights employee.

The Superfund employee who spoke to WIRED says that even though their team is still intact, the furloughs have affected regional staff who help them book travel to the sites they need to monitor. “It’s taking a long time to get travel approved,” they say.

The late October furloughs also hit workers who are part of a long-awaited, large-scale reorganization of how the agency does science. In May, agency leadership announced that it would be significantly changing the Office of Research and Development, the EPA’s independent scientific research arm. Many of the scientists from ORD were to be subsumed into a new office within the Office of the Administrator. Two former ORD employees tell WIRED that they were informed of their new positions hours before they were then given a furlough notice and sent home.

“Could be a method to the madness, but probably just disorganization,” says one EPA employee.

Zeldin was not clear with reporters last week as to a specific date for when carryover funding would run out, but he said that in the “first, second week of November, the agency would have no choice but to then move towards a third phase of implementing a lapse plan—and we don’t want to have to do that.”

Even EPA supervisors seem to be in the dark about what to expect next.

“I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t be able to tell specific groups when they would be furloughed if the shutdown continues [or] how many days of funding they have left,” says one employee. “I can’t think of any reasons other than they want to cause confusion and strife, or if they’re just improvising every day.”

“It’s been a hallmark of this [administration],” claims another worker. “Keep everyone in the dark as much as possible—sow chaos to minimize effectiveness as an agency.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/69028b736d14ebc3afce7267/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Pol_EPA_Getty.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 12:10:51.803792

Analysts and stakeholders say political pressure and policy changes can be partially credited for big-picture changes like the collapse of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. But what they will change within real estate companies’ policies and actions — and how that will impact actual carbon emissions from the built environment — is more opaque.

Real estate owners that have already invested in decarbonizing their portfolios are likely to continue those initiatives, though they may be less eager to share details.

“The volatility of the current regulatory landscape is causing a lot of people to just be very cautious in a way that they perhaps weren't before,” said Camilla Taylor, executive director of the American Sustainable Business Network.

“Businesses and markets don't like unpredictability. … So we're seeing a lot of slowdown of work, a lot of businesses pulling back on commitments, because the unknowns are just too large in forecasting.”

More broadly, investors’ attention to the issue has dwindled. Combined with the difficulty of measuring real estate carbon emissions, that may throw a wrench in some plans.

About five years ago, environmental, social and governance initiatives were a top priority for large corporations, said Daniel Ismail, co-head of strategic research at Green Street. Green Street began undertaking dedicated ESG research at the request of clients who were concerned about decarbonization, regulation and impact on building valuations.

“Over the past two years, it's been more muted than ever,” Ismail said. “It's not been top of clients' minds. What's been top of client minds has been interest rates, cap rate changes [and] insurance costs.”

Major real estate owners and lenders, including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Wells Fargo, this year dropped their commitments to make their portfolios meet net-zero emissions standards by 2050.

“The difficulty in meeting those, in practice, is high,” Ismail said. “It’s incredibly difficult to say, just with respect to commercial real estate, ‘Decarbonize a real estate portfolio.’”

While politicians claimed credit for the mass exodus from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance, corporate strategies are largely driven by investors and practicality. There are both regulatory and commercial imperatives driving the decisions on decarbonization, and those imperatives don’t necessarily align.

Donald Trump signs an executive order in April.

Nationwide Policy

Trump’s second term began with a flurry of executive orders and a commitment to “unleashing American energy” by limiting states’ power to enforce climate change-related regulations. Many Biden-era climate policies were rolled back.

The Securities and Exchange Commission stopped defending its climate disclosure rule, which was challenged in court after being finalized in March 2024. The rule, which was never implemented, would have required public companies to disclose climate-related risks to help investors have comparable, decision-useful information.

During Trump’s first term, he expanded a 30-year-old resiliency program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But three months into his second term, the administration canceled the program, calling it “wasteful” and “politicized.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, placed an expiration date on several energy- and resilience-related tax credits. The energy-efficient commercial buildings deduction — introduced in 2006 for new construction or retrofits and expanded by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act — won’t apply to any buildings on which construction starts after June 2026.

While these deadlines could spur some developers to seek use of tax credits before a deadline, business decisions are often delayed while policy shifts, the ASBN’s Taylor said.

Tax credits have been the main driver of profitability when assessing new construction, she said. Now focus is shifting to adding value across an asset’s life cycle by fortifying buildings against climate risk and making them insurable.

“People are far more interested in the near-term reality of insurance expenses than they are in decarbonization,” Ismail said.

Continued Demand

Insurance costs alone make a case for energy efficiency, resiliency and decarbonization. Developers and owners wanting to build a building that will thrive in the foreseeable future also create demand for sustainability.

“What sustainability brings to a project, it brings risk mitigation, it brings transparency,” Taylor said. “So it just makes for better work.”

Businesses that understand how to leverage the opportunities that sustainability and energy efficiency bring aren’t going to pull back, because that would be bad business practice, she said.

There are also existing financial investments in decarbonization that would be wasteful to undo.

“Rolling those back just doesn't financially make sense,” Taylor said. “Sometimes they're just too big of boats to turn around, even if they wanted to.”

CBRE, for one, has significantly increased its investments in technologies and programs to help clients drive value creation while accelerating progress against their environmental commitments, CBRE Chief Sustainability Officer Rob Bernard said in a statement to Bisnow.

“Our investments at the intersection of sustainability and business are helping our clients accelerate investments, which improve their sustainability and business outcomes,” Bernard said.

CBRE validated its net-zero-by-2040 goal last year, setting new targets for 2030 to reduce its direct and indirect emissions by 50% and the intensity of emissions from properties it manages for clients by 55% from its 2019 baseline.

ESG isn’t as in vogue as it was during the latter part of the last decade, but institutional owners of real estate know that tenants prefer newer, high-quality buildings, Ismail said. It may not be as easy to invest in decarbonization as it was during the zero-interest-rate period, but it still pencils.

“That is synonymous with buildings that have more green features, that have better carbon footprints and so on,” Ismail said. “From just a strategic direction, I don't think it's changed much. … Landlords and tenants generally would prefer a greener building than a browner one.”

But it is hard to measure how much that is actually changing levels of carbon emissions in the built environment, which is known to account for about 40% of carbon emissions globally. With a lack of standardized metrics and knowledge of entire supply chains, exact carbon emission measurements remain unclear, making net-zero targets harder to reach, Ismail said.

“The same problems today existed a few years ago. You're not getting apples-to-apples comparisons across all property sectors or markets,” Ismail said. “That's a problem that, regardless of who's in charge of the federal government, is still going to persist. It's just a very difficult problem to crack.”

The vast majority of REITs still report the same level of disclosure that they did during the Biden administration, Ismail said. But some policy changes — like the Environmental Protection Agency’s move to no longer track power plants’ carbon emissions — could make tracking commercial real estate’s downstream impacts more difficult.

Opposing Forces

Despite a clear position from the federal government, state and local laws create a patchwork of regulations related to buildings’ carbon emissions, and it is these state laws that have been the major driver of sustainability regulation in the U.S. over the past decade.

New York City property owners began incurring fines over the past year under Local Law 97, which requires them to disclose greenhouse gas emissions for buildings 25K SF and larger to the New York City Department of Buildings.

Many landlords currently deem the penalties affordable, though Green Street estimates they will ramp up to about 1% of net operating income by 2030, Ismail said.

“The biggest pain point right now is just in meeting the law from a reporting and calculation standpoint,” he said.

The law suffers from being overly broad and generic, but it may help other local governments implement carbon taxes going forward, Ismail said. Local Law 97 and the state’s ban on putting natural gas appliances and systems in new buildings — which was overturned in court in California but upheld in New York — make the city a good testing ground for these types of laws.

The regulations could nudge landlords to prepare their entire portfolios to meet regulations and reporting standards, since they could broadly apply systems used to track emissions in New York City.

There is pressure from the other direction, though. Texas in 2021 began passing laws prohibiting state entities from doing business with banks that “boycott” energy companies.

The American Sustainable Business Council, an affiliate of the ASBN, is suing the state to challenge the law’s constitutionality. Texas, which has the world’s eighth-largest economy, can also present a replicable model for other states to roll back ESG legislation.

“It's a good incubator,” Taylor said. “So I do think what happens in Texas is extremely important in the entire country.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who opened a review of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions’ status under the state’s anti-ESG law in late 2023, applauded the banks for leaving the United Nations-affiliated Net-Zero Banking Alliance.

“More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance,” Paxton said in a statement. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities.”

The mass exodus led to the organization officially folding last month, four years after its formation. JPMorgan, which said in its 2024 climate report that it doesn’t make decisions based on political or social agendas, said in a statement about leaving the NZBA that it would “remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security.”

Subdued external communication about sustainability initiatives despite unchanged internal policy is a phenomenon being referred to as “green hushing.”

“There has been a large attack on language and how people describe what they do,” ASBN President David Levine said.

The Trump administration scrubbed the words “climate change” from federal websites, including the Department of Agriculture and EPA sites, within a month of Trump taking office. A FEMA memo in February listed 34 words and phrases to be removed from its documents, including “changing climate,” “climate resilience” and “net zero.”

The Department of Energy added “climate change,” “green” and “decarbonization” to its list of words to avoid at its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in late September, Politico reported, citing a department email.

The attack on language has stoked fear among the business community of being singled out, Levine said.

“At the end of the day, silence around these issues is not going to get us progress,” he said.",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F11%2F690b858c0948e-thomas-richter-b09tl5bsqjk-unsplash.jpeg&width=1200&sign=bynYSJfmGX_AA3ApaV6h76Ao3oAgfRyYUyg3pJnDRLA,N,,2025-11-10 12:11:05.914400

Adding nuclear and gas

Vistra owns about 43.7 GW, including 22.3 GW in eastern U.S. markets, 19.6 GW in Texas and 1.6 GW in California.

Those numbers are set to grow through possible uprates at nuclear power plants and by building new resources, officials with the Irving, Texas-based independent power producer, said Thursday during a quarterly earnings conference call with equity analysts.

Vistra expects to finish analyzing by the end of the year the potential to add capacity at its nuclear power plants — with initial expectations that the company could increase its 6.6-GW nuclear fleet by about 10% starting in the early 2030s, Jim Burke, Vistra president and CEO, said.

Also, Vistra plans to build 860 MW of gas-fired generation in West Texas by mid-2028 for about $900 million, company officials said.

The plans come as Vistra is in discussions with companies seeking to buy power, including for data centers, according to Burke.

“Data center development remains robust, with the number of planned facilities across the U.S. more than doubling from 12 months ago,” Burke said. “We continue to see an acceleration in strong customer interest … and we believe the momentum we have today should enable us to realize multiple contracting opportunities.”

Vistra is seeing “record levels of interest” from customers across its existing portfolio as well as for new generation, according to Stacey Doré, chief strategy and sustainability officer and executive vice president of public affairs.

Excess capacity for near-term growth

Despite talk of energy shortfalls in leading markets, Burke said there is enough capacity in off “super peak” hours to meet near-term demand growth for customers willing to be flexible.

“There is excess capacity on the system in most markets today, particularly the major markets we’re in — ERCOT and PJM — to meet most of the load growth during these non-super-peak hours,” Burke said.

Data centers and other large load customers can use onsite backup generation to supply their power as well as demand response during those “super peak” hours, he added.

Load growth is already leading to higher utilization rates at Vistra’s combined-cycle gas-fired power plants, where capacity factors have increased in the low 50% to the high 50% range over the last several years, according to Burke.

Growing demand could drive utilization at combined-cycle gas plants to the mid-80% range over time, Burke said.

Kris Moldovan, Vistra executive vice president and CFO, said he sees opportunities for Vistra to grow by buying assets.

“The opportunity set for inorganic growth is … at a high level right now,” he said.

Last month, Vistra closed on a $1.9 billion deal to buy 2.6 GW of gas-fired generation from Lotus Infrastructure Partners.

Capacity factors — a measure of a power plant’s usage rate — at Vistra’s power plant fleet were generally lower in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2024, according to the company.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/r4mFXuzg2DwA0OpdtgV5TWdYyDvfsENaKgHZ5Ps2c1I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Db21hbmNoZV9QZWFrX051Y2xlYXJfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnRfQXVndXN0XzIwMTdfY3JvcHBlZC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:43.372464

It recently announced $1.84 million in taxpayer-funded grants through the Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure Program.

That amount makes up just the first two rounds of funding. In total, $30 million was allocated to the program in 2024 as a one-time amount.

The $1.84 million funded 201 new electric vehicle charging stations at 31 multifamily properties across Michigan. That means each station cost an average of $9,200.

The next two rounds of funding, which should be announced soon, will also fund stations as multifamily properties. According to a statement from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, which implements the program, this is because those sites often “lack at-home charging options.”

This is all part of a broader clean energy plan that Michigan is hoping to implement, titled the MI Healthy Climate Plan.

As part of that plan, the state plans “to build out the infrastructure to support 2 million EVs on Michigan roads by 2030.”

Currently, the state reports 1,700 charging locations across Michigan. To support its 2030 goal, “Michigan will need approximately 10,000 DCFC and 90,000 Level 2 chargers,” making this program just a small part of the state’s overall EV charger plan.

This is just one of many grant programs funded by the taxpayers in Michigan that are pushing this climate plan.

Another example is a recently announced new round of funding totaling $35.9 million for electric school buses. This funding is part of the Michigan Department of Education’s $125 million Clean Bus Energy Grant program, which will help 23 schools and districts add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses to fleets across the state.

While the typical new diesel school bus can cost in the $125,000 to $150,000 range, electric school buses are substantially more expensive. Many electric school buses currently cost about $300,000 to $400,000.

The MDE’s grant program is allocating about $370,000 per bus. Interim State Superintendent Sue C. Carnell applauded the funding.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” she said. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to make our state greener.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/72/272ed2ca-3931-4b8c-859f-26c359fec32c/68dab63d6fc45.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-11-10 15:05:41.148397

Around a quarter of methane emissions in the U.S. come from the oil and gas sector.","Sharon Wilson spent more than a decade in the oil business, never expecting to become one of its fiercest critics. But something in her snapped after she moved to rural Texas and saw her water and air fouled by a surge of fracking that quickly consumed her community.

Over the next 28 years, Wilson became one of the nation’s most relentless campaigners against the oil and gas industry—an industry that continues to enjoy near-unchecked sway in Texas, despite having extracted more planet-heating fuels across the country than any other nation in recent history. “It is a losing battle,” Wilson said. “But people are enraged. I’m not the radical here; they are. They called me all sorts of horrible names, threatened me—death threats, all kinds of things.”

Wilson’s work as a self-described “methane hunter” takes her across the vast, flat expanses of Texas, where at times the only structures breaking the horizon are tangles of oil and gas pipes and wellheads. Her workload is prodigious. Wilson has tracked methane gushing from tens of thousands of wells across the state and captured what she calls “horrific” emissions from gas turbines that power an Elon Musk-owned data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Her persistence earned Wilson recognition well beyond Texas—she’s now worked with environmental groups including Earthworks and, more recently, Oilfield Witness—but she’s often seen as a lone operator, a one-woman chronicler of the secret smog that is cooking our planet. What began as a local crusade now has international implications: Wilson has briefed regulators and journalists in the United Kingdom, Japan, and across Europe.

In the past decade, Wilson has taken up a new weapon in her fight: an imaging camera that visualizes the emissions billowing from the myriad oil and gas wells that puncture central and western Texas. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, cannot be seen by the naked eye—but through the lens of Wilson’s camera, it shows up in startling oranges and reds.

Filming from public roads, her infrared lens reveals what she calls “egregious emissions” from facilities that often have few, if any, workers onsite to prevent major leaks. “And they can do that because it’s invisible,” she said. “The industry can tell you anything, and there’s no way you can verify it by looking at the site unless you have a camera like I do.”

Her footage has shamed industry giants and won her new prominence. She appears in two new documentaries: This is Not a Drill, now showing at film festivals, and Gaslit, featuring Jane Fonda. If the American public could actually see the amount of methane spewing from oil and gas facilities, then “there never would [have been] a fracking boom [to begin with],” Wilson says in This is Not a Drill, which follows her as she aims her specialized camera at leaking wells and compressor stations.

“Sharon is a badass,” said Josh Eisenberg, who collaborated with Wilson at Earthworks. “Across the industry, methane emissions have been underestimated for a long time. There aren’t many of us doing this work, we are spread pretty thin, but the cameras have been pivotal to allow us to see how many pollution events are really happening.”

Methane hunting is a far cry from the quiet life Wilson imagined after leaving her data job in the fossil fuel industry and moving to a 42-acre plot in Wise County, northwest of Dallas. Back then, the sounds she cherished were the yips of coyotes and the laughter of her son, Adam, as they lay under the Texas sky tracing constellations onto paper.

That contentment was shattered by the advance of technology that turned the United States into the world’s oil and gas superpower: fracking. The method, which involves horizontal drilling deep underground to dislodge oil and gas from tightly-packed rock formations—first took hold in the 1990s near Wilson’s home atop the Permian Basin, a vast, mineral-rich formation stretching across western Texas and New Mexico that has since become the epicenter of America’s fracking boom.

It was in the early 2000s when Wilson began to notice towers of light so bright they washed out the stars. Adam, only 10 years old, wrote “they murdered the stars” in an essay for school. Disturbed, Wilson began snapping photos of drilling sites multiplying around her. She posted the images on a blog, which caught the attention of neighbors who shared with Wilson complaints of skin lesions, headaches, and tremors they blamed on nearby wells. One man even filmed a jet of flame erupting from his garden hose, claiming methane had seeped into his water supply.

Wilson had complaints of her own, too. “My air turned brown, and eventually so did my water,” she said. “At first, it just disappeared. I didn’t have any water. The house was shaking because there was air in the pipes. I suspect it was methane. It would come out of the faucet like a sharp burst of air, but no water, and then this big blob of black stuff plopped in my sink. After days, it [the water] started running gray and sandy.”

Wilson couldn’t prove fracking was the cause, but the experience perturbed her enough to move nearly an hour away to Denton, Texas, where she threw herself into activism. In 2014, she helped rally residents to vote for the state’s first ban on fracking within city limits—a victory swiftly overturned by the Texas Legislature the following year.

It was around that time that Wilson persuaded Earthworks to buy her the optical gas-imaging camera that came to define her campaign. She also took an industry course to learn how to use the camera. “The instructor kept quiet about who I was because they probably would’ve killed me,” she said, realizing then that the camera could become her most powerful tool. “People have a very strong reaction to those images. They’re just immediately either very angry or shocked.”

The backlash to Wilson’s work has been fierce. She says she’s been run off the road, threatened with violence, and warned her family would be taken out “Chicago style.” One commenter on Wilson’s blog told her to “remove this video before I remove your jaw.” Others, she said, have doxxed her online, posting her home address among many personal details.

Wilson suspects the industry’s hand in some of the harassment. She points to two lawsuits she believes were Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation—or SLAPP—suits meant to silence her. The Texas Oil and Gas Association, the state’s main industry group, did not respond to a request for comment on these or other allegations related to fracking.

Wilson presses on, alhough she stopped sending her videos and other evidence to the state regulator. She argues the agency is too supine to the interests of oil and gas companies to act. “The Texas Council for Environmental Quality views its responsibilities to ensure compliance as a priority and thoroughly and diligently investigates allegations of noncompliance, including citizen complaints,” a spokesman for TCEQ, the state regulator, told Atmos.

When it comes to methane, however, there is little for regulators to enforce. The Biden administration sought to strengthen oversight, but many of those efforts were rolled back under President Donald Trump. Earlier this year, a proposed fee on methane emissions was scrapped, and companies were granted extensions on several rules aimed at reducing leaks—which the Environmental Protection Agency called “an important step in unleashing the nation’s domestic energy supply.”

Despite being a lesser-known cousin of carbon dioxide, methane packs far greater heat-trapping power. It is responsible for around one-third of all global heating since pre-industrial times; alarmingly, its atmospheric levels have been rising at an accelerating rate since around 2006, driven by fracking, faster decomposition in wetlands, and the expansion of livestock farming, particularly cattle.

Around a quarter of methane emissions in the U.S. come from the oil and gas sector. Rather than capture and sell the emissions to make natural gas, many producers in places like the Permian Basin choose to vent the gas and release it in a bid to keep costs low and the methane invisible—that is, until Wilson’s camera makes it seen. Some methane escapes through leaky pipes. The flares that burn atop wells, a process known as flaring, convert methane into carbon dioxide, preventing the more potent gas from escaping directly into the atmosphere. But while flaring destroys methane, it still releases carbon dioxide, adding to overall greenhouse pollution.

The industry insists it has made progress in reducing methane leaks. But environmental groups claim the emissions are far higher than official figures suggest. The Permian Basin alone releases around 1.4 million metric tons of methane each year, all of which is essentially wasted, drifting into the shared atmosphere and deepening the climate crisis. “This really should be the low-hanging fruit of the climate problem,” said Amy Townsend-Small, a researcher and professor in the School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Cincinnati. “Instead, the emissions rates are getting faster and faster, which is a scary thing for our climate. There are a lot of methane sources from human activities, but [methane leaks from oil and gas wells] are so obvious and clear to cut back on.”

Wilson sees little chance of reform under the Trump administration, so she has turned her focus abroad, speaking with lawmakers and activists from Mexico and the European Union to Japan about methane’s dangers. After all, some world leaders are already pushing for a binding global pact to slash methane, much as the Montreal Protocol once phased out CFCs and saved the ozone layer. “We need binding objectives on methane,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at a climate summit in New York in September. “We know that this is a reachable goal. This is the best way to reduce our emissions.”

That kind of talk gives Wilson a measure of hope. “For a long time, I didn’t think that it was moving the needle,” she said. “And I don’t know if it’s moving it enough, but I do feel like what we’re doing now, what Oilfield Witness is doing, is making a difference.” Still, for Wilson, the ultimate goal isn’t tighter methane rules—it’s an end to the age of combustion itself. “We have to stop burning things,” she added. “We just don’t need to burn things for energy anymore.”",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Atmos_WIDE_SarahKarlan_MethaneHunters-16_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:31.562949

Labour argues that clean power will generate cheaper, more secure energy and support hundreds of thousands of new jobs. But Reform and the Conservatives blame the UK’s climate targets for rising energy bills and job losses, and Nigel Farage accuses the government of “deindustrialising Britain” by pursuing net zero.

Decarbonisation does not mean deindustrialisation: in many places it can be the opposite. IPPR research suggests green industries will revitalise communities that were devastated by the dramatic decline of manufacturing and heavy industry in the Eighties and Nineties. The north and Midlands could manufacture globally competitive wind turbines, heat pumps and green transport.

But it’s not straightforward. Some industries will change substantially as businesses adopt green technologies and others – especially oil and gas – will shrink, disrupting people’s livelihoods. Deindustrialisation in the 20th century led to hardship and disaffection; its legacy may be fuelling the rise of radical-right populism in “left behind” communities. Any hint of a repeat could be politically ruinous. Policy choices aren’t all win-win, because the interests of consumers and the energy workforce aren’t perfectly aligned.

Ed Miliband’s pledge to consumers is cheaper, more abundant energy generated by renewables. But the affordability of clean energy depends on the cost of building out renewables, which is partly determined by the labour costs incurred by energy companies. In our privatised energy market, the pursuit of an abundance of clean energy jobs may jar with the economics of providing cheap renewable energy if labour intensity comes at the expense of capital efficiency.

How should the government navigate these trade-offs fairly? Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has announced a raft of policies focused on the energy workforce. Its offer to energy workers is clear: the government is working to create abundant clean-energy jobs and is supporting oil and gas workers to access them, in Aberdeen for example.

Should ministers go further? Unions and researchers, including IPPR, have estimated that it would cost around £1.1bn to retrain millions of workers whose jobs will be affected this decade by net zero. In a highly constrained fiscal environment, the prospect of the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stumping up that kind of cash seems unlikely.

Ultimately, the government must define what constitutes a “fair transition” and relentlessly pursue it. Miliband should remain bullish about the potential for renewables to provide secure and plentiful energy. Weaning our energy system off gas will make us less reliant on volatile global supply chains and hostile autocratic states – the public understands this. Ministers should also compel businesses to play their part. Oil and gas companies bear as much responsibility for the fate of their workforce – whose skills have buoyed their margins and whose livelihoods are now disrupted as investment is pulled out of the North Sea – as the state does for deliberately accelerating the industry’s decline.

With climate policy intensely politicised, the government’s judgement should be guided by what is most likely to keep the public onside. After a punishing cost-of-living crisis, the surest way to convince Britons that it’s in their interests to tackle climate change may be to cut their energy bills.",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/11/10/gettyimages-2173950270-800x418.jpg?1762795398,N,,2025-11-10 14:05:25.235512

Found in everyday products and industrial applications, these persistent substances raise serious questions about their long-term impact on health and the environment.

Dr Kourtchev offers expert insights into how these chemicals behave, why they are so difficult to manage, and the challenges of tackling their widespread presence across the UK.

Can you explain what forever chemicals are and why they’re called that?

Forever chemicals are a term used to describe a large group of manufactured substances, also known as PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They’re used in everyday products like non-stick cookware and waterproof clothing.

They’re called forever chemicals because they don’t easily break down in the environment or in our bodies. They can persist for years, even decades, which raises concerns about their potential health effects.

What industries and products are they most commonly used in?

They’ve been used in a huge range of applications – everything from pizza boxes and non-stick cookware to waterproof materials like Gore-Tex used in outdoor clothing.

Some of these chemicals have been phased out, but others have been reintroduced. For example, industries used to rely on long-chain PFAS, which were found to be very toxic. They then substituted them with shorter-chain PFAS, assuming they’d be safer.

But later studies showed that the shorter-chain versions can be just as harmful – perhaps a bit less persistent in the environment, but still potentially toxic. There are more than 5,000 known PFAS compounds, but only two or three are currently being regulated.

What are the potential health implications of these chemicals?

Based on the scientific literature, PFAS have been linked to hormone (endocrine) disruption, suppression of the immune system, and several types of cancer.

The challenge is that most of this data comes from just a small subset of PFAS that have been studied — and we know there are thousands more that haven’t been tested.

So there could be many effects we don’t even know about yet, given how many of these chemicals exist.

How do these forever chemicals end up in our water systems? Are there particular entry points that are especially concerning?

In my research group, we study wastewater treatment systems, which are often seen as repositories for liquid waste. We also investigate the atmospheric fate of PFAS, an area that is not only under-researched, but also largely neglected by regulators, as most existing regulations focus on water and soil. Unfortunately, current treatment technologies aren’t designed to remove PFAS effectively.

In some cases, treatment processes can actually break long-chain PFAS into shorter-chain forms, which are still not removed and continue into the water stream. So, PFAS can pass straight through treatment plants and enter rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.

You mentioned that treatment systems can’t currently remove them — are water companies developing new technologies to tackle that?

Yes, absolutely, and I don’t think we should blame the water industry — they’re under significant pressure to meet regulations, and as new evidence emerges, they’re actively developing better techniques.

Some companies are experimenting with carbon-based methods that can absorb PFAS. Because PFAS are water-repellent, they tend to stick to surfaces — like algae or other materials in the water rather than staying dissolved.

So, water companies are now working on absorption and filtration techniques to capture them. But the main challenge is that PFAS are incredibly stable.

Traditional treatment systems were never designed to deal with chemicals like these, which means they often slip through the process. We’re still in the early stages of tackling this environmental threat, so it’s not just about blaming water companies — they need support.

A recent BBC report suggests that around six million people in the UK could be at risk of PFAS in their drinking water. Are there certain regions more affected, or is this a nationwide issue?

The Environment Agency published a report last year identifying more than 10,000 potential PFAS ‘hotspots’ across the UK.

It’s not confined to one area – contamination can occur anywhere. For example, one major source is aqueous film-forming foams used in firefighting. Older versions of these foams contained PFAS, so areas near airports or firefighting training sites are often contaminated.

So, certain industries and sites should be prioritised when tackling contamination?

Exactly, and this isn’t just a UK problem – it’s global. For instance, in North Carolina in the US, one company was accused of contaminating large areas with PFAS. People living near affected plants had much higher PFAS levels in their blood compared to the general population.

Because PFAS accumulate in our bodies over time, even small, continuous exposures can become significant. For one common PFAS compound – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – the estimated half-life in humans is up to three years. That’s a long time for something potentially harmful to stay in your system.

Short-term exposure might not cause immediate effects, but long-term, consistent exposure through contaminated water or air could lead to serious health issues.

How would you assess the UK’s response compared to other countries? Do we need stronger regulation or more government support?

We definitely need more testing. If you look at global PFAS pollution maps, you’ll see many red zones across Europe. But in some areas, there’s no data — not because PFAS aren’t present, but because no one’s measuring them. So the first step is investment in monitoring. Without evidence, governments can’t act.

The UK is catching up, but countries like the US are further ahead because they’ve gathered more data. Once they had that evidence, they introduced stricter regulations — and many US states have now banned the production of certain PFAS compounds. By 2030, several companies have committed to stopping PFAS manufacturing entirely.

Therefore, we need to follow that example — conduct more testing to understand the scale of the problem, and then build regulations around the evidence. But it’s a massive challenge. For example, a report from Belgium, one of the most PFAS-contaminated countries in Europe, estimated that cleaning up all affected land would cost more than the country’s entire GDP.

Realistically, can we ever completely tackle this issue, or is it more about mitigation now?

That’s a very good, and also quite philosophical, question. I don’t think we should aim to eliminate PFAS entirely – they do have valuable uses, particularly in medicine, for example, in implants where stability is essential.

They were designed to be durable — that’s both their strength and their flaw. So rather than banning all PFAS, we need to strike a balance: restrict their use to essential applications and prevent unnecessary use in everyday products.

Simply replacing one group of chemicals with another won’t solve the problem. We need smarter regulation and a better understanding of the alternatives.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2328374295.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:16.467086

Climate action is not only a moral responsibility—it’s an economic necessity. The global shift to a low-carbon economy is accelerating, changing how growth happens and where capital flows. To stay competitive, Canada must catalyse investment across clean and conventional sectors so our industries can meet the world’s rising demand for low-carbon products and energy. In the face of global uncertainty, Canada’s new government is focused on what we can control. How we respond to the challenge of climate disruptions will influence Canada's economic competitiveness, drive new investment opportunities, and shape our global standing for generations to come. Canada must take action to fight climate change, drive down emissions, and invest in building the economy of the future.

Today, the Honourable Adam van Koeverden, Secretary of State (Sport), echoed the announcement highlighting Canada’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy—a strategy based on driving investment and achieving results. Building on Canada's competitive advantages and global standing as a clean energy superpower, the strategy will strengthen our economy by:

strengthening industrial carbon pricing

providing clarity on regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

boosting clean economy investment through tax credits

supporting critical minerals projects

mobilising capital for the transition to net-zero

developing new metrics to track our success.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help Canada build the strongest economy in the G7. With this strategy, we can leverage Canada’s unique strengths—like our abundant natural resources and innovation in clean technology—to attract investment, create good jobs in communities across the country, and ensure Canada continues to be competitive on the world stage. Every step we take to build infrastructure, train workers, and support innovation in this is an investment in Canada’s long-term prosperity.

The strategy will create the conditions to propel Canada’s competitive advantage through investments in clean growth technologies. By investing in innovation and scaling homegrown solutions, we will position Canadian companies to lead. We will leverage Canadian clean technology to reduce the emissions intensity of the energy we generate, and the products and resources we produce. This will both address climate change and open more economic opportunities internationally.

Canada has the assets to lead and seize the tremendous opportunities of the historic transformation towards low-carbon energy, growing jobs and improving affordability across the economy.

A solution is to use electricity generated by solar and wind power to power an electrolyzer, a device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen then can be stored, transported, and ultimately converted into electricity and water through fuel cells.

Developing a skilled workforce with knowledge of hydrogen technologies will be essential to expanding the hydrogen economy, Teixeira said.

“Massachusetts is investing in industry-academic collaborations aimed at improving the state’s energy resiliency, and hydrogen will play a big role in expanding economic activity,” Teixeira said. “The people we train will become workers for emerging and established hydrogen companies in Massachusetts.”

The WPI-led team will work with community colleges in Massachusetts to recruit the first cohort of 13 students for the training program before the end of 2025. Mortazavi hopes to attract a wide range of applicants, including first-generation college students, veterans, and people from low-income families.

Students selected for the program will receive stipends and spend about four weeks in training focused on hydrogen safety, production, use, and infrastructure manufacturing. The cohort will train in laboratories at WPI and at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems at Western New England University.

Students then will be placed in internships with corporate partners for about three months. After their internships, students will have access to mentoring, career counseling, and other job placement services at WPI.

The program aims to equip students with the technical and practical skills needed to secure jobs across the hydrogen energy sector. Potential roles could include fuel cell and electrolyzer technicians or engineers and hydrogen infrastructure specialists.

“A critical element of this training program is the collaboration across academic disciplines at WPI and among WPI, other educational institutions, industry partners, regional workforce and clean energy organizations, and federal agencies,” Mortazavi said. “The program brings together the mechanical and chemical engineering programs, with support from several WPI offices and external partners, to offer a holistic experience for participants who might otherwise face barriers to finding jobs in emerging technology fields.”",https://www.wpi.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/NDZ_6430-Edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:47.674011

Rising energy prices will continue to resonate with voters as a major problem requiring serious solutions.
Voters’ preferred solution to address energy affordability is clear: building more solar and storage, the fastest and most affordable forms of energy to add to the grid.
Solar energy is a winner at the ballot box.","In the months leading up to Election Day on Tuesday, November 4, fast-rising electricity prices — and what to do about them — emerged as a priority issue for voters around the country.

Soon after the polls closed and the results came rolling in, it became clear that supporting solar and storage to lower costs is more than just good policy. It’s good politics, too.

In race after race, voters elected candidates who made lowering electricity costs through investing in solar and storage a central tenet of their messaging and policy platforms. And some candidates learned the hard way that if you shy away from solar and storage, voters will shy away from you.

In New Jersey, where electricity prices skyrocketed roughly 20% this summer, exit polls showed a whopping 87% of voters considered electricity costs to be a problem. Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won by running on an energy affordability platform that includes many of SEIA’s suggested solutions to help lower prices: growing capacity by investing in cheap, quick-to-deploy solar; streamlining permitting to reduce energy projects’ soft costs that quickly add up; promoting community solar; and expanding battery storage. Sherrill also promised to declare a “state of emergency on energy costs.”

In Virginia — the data center capital of the world, where power prices have surged 13% in the past year — Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger and many candidates for the Virginia House of Delegates won decisive victories by embracing solar and storage to lower people’s bills. Spanberger’s energy affordability plan includes expanding and incentivizing solar development in certain places like brownfields, rooftops, parking lots, and public buildings; deploying more energy storage; implementing Virtual Power Plants to take better advantage of existing distributed energy resources; and reducing costs for consumers “by speeding up timelines to bring new projects online.”

A similar story occurred in the race for two of five seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission, the board that regulates the state’s utility companies and the rates they charge for electricity. Challengers Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson ousted incumbents in landslide victories by focusing on the need to lower utility bills and invest in clean, reliable energy.

Rising energy prices will continue to resonate with voters as a major problem requiring serious solutions.

In 2026, we will see elections for 36 Governor’s seats, 35 U.S. Senate seats, and every single U.S. House district — and voters will continue to gravitate to candidates that offer a clear, pragmatic strategy to lower their electricity bills. Voters in nine states (Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) have the chance to decide on 14 commissioners to serve on their respective state utility commissions.

A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 76% of U.S. adults are concerned about their electricity bills — with 36% saying these costs are “major” concern. Customers in the PJM power grid territory, which serves more than 65 million people across 13 states, will see another spike in their bills next June.

If this Administration continues to block solar and storage projects from adding affordable, reliable energy to the grid, and energy intensive data centers and AI continue to proliferate, Americans’ electric bills will continue to rise. And voters will continue to demand solutions to increase energy supply and drive down costs.

Voters’ preferred solution to address energy affordability is clear: building more solar and storage, the fastest and most affordable forms of energy to add to the grid.

Solar energy is a winner at the ballot box. All policymakers and candidates for office in 2026 would be wise to follow the blueprint laid out by this year’s winners and prioritize lowering people’s electricity bills by expanding solar and storage.",https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_537638398.webp,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:51.547989

Voters approved three pro-business tax amendments on Election Day, ensuring that the Lone Star State can never impose taxes on capital gains, estates or inheritances, and certain securities transactions.

While Texas doesn't currently levy these taxes, the new constitutional amendments make that tax certainty permanent, sending a signal to investors and corporations that the state’s low-tax structure is here to stay.

WHY MAJOR FINANCIAL FIRMS ARE EXPANDING TEXAS PRESENCE BEYOND TRADITIONAL WALL STREET HUB

""These votes make it clear that Texas’ low-tax structure isn’t just policy, it’s now permanent,"" Carliss Chatman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law, told FOX Business. ""Whereas other states try to lure an Amazon or Facebook with temporary tax breaks or incentives, Texas doesn’t have to because we would never charge those taxes anyway. The incentives here are permanent, and now it’s unconstitutional for the state to start taxing you.""

Here’s what the three measures mean:

Capital gains tax ban: Prevents Texas from ever taxing profits from the sale of investments, real estate, or other capital assets, a move meant to reassure investors and entrepreneurs.

Securities transaction tax ban: Bars the state from imposing taxes on financial trades or payroll transactions, effectively ruling out a ""Wall Street tax"" on buying or selling stocks.

Estate and inheritance tax ban: Prohibits any future taxation on wealth transfers after death, a safeguard for business owners and families looking to pass assets to heirs.

NYSE COMING TO TEXAS AS LONE STAR STATE CONTINUES TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES

That’s the message Texas is sending not only to the more than 200 companies that have moved their headquarters to the state since the COVID-19 pandemic, including Caterpillar, CBRE, Chevron, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, KFC and Oracle, but also to potential newcomers weighing relocation.

Critics argue that locking in these bans could hamstring future legislatures from raising revenue during economic downturns or to fund essential state services. It also forces the state to rely more heavily on property and sales taxes, which tend to hit middle- and lower-income residents harder.

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL SECTOR LOSING GROUND TO RIVALS

Supporters counter that Texas’ growing economy – now the eighth-largest in the world – generates more than enough revenue without such taxes, pointing to the state’s budget surplus and rapid job growth as evidence that low taxes can fuel prosperity rather than constrain it.

The timing is also strategic. The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), which recently secured SEC approval, is slated to open in Dallas in 2026, positioning itself as a direct challenger to the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.

TXSE executives say the goal is to revitalize competition and attract more companies to go public by offering a more affordable and business-friendly listing environment. Over the past 25 years, the number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. has dropped by nearly 45%, according to the exchange, a decline it hopes to reverse.

Meanwhile, on both coasts, Democrats are taking the opposite approach. In California, a proposed ballot measure would impose a 5% wealth tax on high-net-worth residents to help fund the state’s Medicaid program — underscoring a growing divide in how states approach taxing success.

Global petrochemical hubs are contending with oversupply and shrinking margins, pressures that are eroding plant utilization and investor confidence.","Renewables paired with storage have overtaken new gas projects on cost in most major markets—from India to South Africa to Brazil. The IEA’s Renewables 2025 report concludes that nearly all new capacity this decade will be renewable.

The “age of electricity” has begun, with renewable generation surpassing coal generation for the first time, in the first half of 2025. This significant milestone is highlighted in Ember’s Global Electricity Review 2025. Grids worldwide are being rebuilt around clean power, and fossil generation is rapidly losing market share.

Clean power generated closer to where it’s used, together with modernized transmission lines and advanced battery storage, is proving more reliable and affordable than volatile gas markets. The next challenge is scaling these solutions fairly—streamlining approvals, partnering with local communities, and ensuring that clean energy investments deliver shared benefits for the households and regions that need them most. But unlocking this transition also depends on lowering the cost of capital, expanding access to finance and technology, and building local capacity to deploy and maintain new energy systems.

This transition is already reshaping global labor markets. According to the IEA, clean power was the single-largest source of new energy employment in 2023, accounting for 40 percent of total job growth across the clean energy sector. Roughly 21 million people now work in power generation, including 4.5 million in solar photovoltaics alone after another record year of job growth. Employment in grids and storage rose by 230,000 to reach eight million in 2023. Ensuring that fossil fuel workers and other vulnerable communities share in these expanding opportunities will be essential to delivering a just and inclusive transition.

Heavy industry—sectors like steel, cement, and chemicals, long viewed as being hard to abate—is beginning to see the rising use of electrification, clean hydrogen, and circular production models, guided by frameworks like the European Union Industrial Emissions Directive and the United Arab Emirates Just Transition Work Programme. Globally, the drivers of energy transition are transforming how these sectors compete and innovate in a clean energy economy.

An equally important frontier is tackling non-CO2 greenhouse gases from methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. The Global Methane Pledge—now endorsed by 159 countries and the European Commission—has catalyzed momentum for methane abatement across energy and industry. Progress is visible from the local to the global levels:

In the United States, New Mexico’s methane regulations have driven down oil and gas emissions, cutting the state’s methane intensity to less than half that of Texas.

The Global Methane Hub’s $10 million initiative to help cities in Latin America and the Caribbean curb methane emissions is accelerating regional action.

And at the same time, leaders like Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados continue to push for a legally binding global methane pact, highlighting the growing political will despite implementation challenges.

China's decision to include methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases in its latest national commitment adds further momentum, broadening the base for industrial emissions reductions worldwide. At the same time, significant progress on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phasedowns under the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment reinforces how cooperative global action on short-lived climate pollutants can deliver fast results—a theme underscored as the Montreal Protocol meetings coincide with the first week of COP30.

Reducing methane leaks, eliminating industrial nitrous oxide, and improving process efficiency are now core performance metrics for manufacturing companies competing in a global market that values transparency and compliance. By cutting these emissions early, countries and companies are lowering costs, building more resilient supply chains, and positioning themselves ahead of tightening global production standards.

The petrochemicals sector—once touted as oil’s “last growth market”—is now facing a structural overbuild. Derived from oil and gas, petrochemicals are used to make plastics, fertilizers, and countless manufactured goods that were once seen as the oil and gas industry’s next frontier. But new data show that global petrochemical supply capacity is expanding faster than demand, driving down margins and utilization rates. Global petrochemical hubs are contending with oversupply and shrinking margins, pressures that are eroding plant utilization and investor confidence.

Policy reforms are beginning to shift the petrochemical sector toward greater efficiency and circularity, but progress remains uneven and too slow. In many countries, energy efficiency standards for petrochemical plants are being updated, yet most remain voluntary or lack enforcement—limiting their impact on fuel use and emissions. At the same time, subsidies and tax breaks for new fossil-based facilities continue to drive excess capacity, locking in high emissions and financial risk. Industrial policies are starting to incorporate recycling and resource-efficiency targets, but they still largely prioritize export growth and cheap feedstocks over deep decarbonization, leaving circular-economy and climate goals only partially aligned.

Governments should strengthen efficiency standards, quickly end subsidies and tax breaks that encourage excessive petrochemical production, and align industrial policy with circular-economy and climate goals. Policies that reward recycled feedstocks and verified emissions reductions can stabilize markets while cutting harmful pollution and waste.

For investors, the message is clear: The petrochemical build-out has overshot realistic demand for these products. The next decade will reward optimization of existing facilities—through efficiency gains, lower emissions, and smarter resource use—rather than new capacity built mainly to prop up continued oil and gas extraction.

At the 2025 U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), countries have a unique opportunity to challenge fossil-fueled optimism—and the outsize influence of industry lobbyists within the U.N. climate talks—and to confront the realities of climate implementation. The credibility of global oil and gas demand will be tested not by models but by how decisively countries deliver on their Paris Agreement commitments in this decade.

Leaders can help turn ambition into measurable progress—by scaling up renewable power, protecting and restoring nature-based carbon sinks, and accelerating cuts in methane, fluorinated refrigerants, and other non-CO2 pollutants. COP30 must demonstrate that implementation delivers tangible results: cleaner energy, stronger economies, and fairer outcomes for communities, including the final ending of harmful subsidies that keep fossil fuels artificially competitive.

The oil and gas industry’s growth story rests on assumptions already undermined by technology, markets, and policy. Key economies shaping the COP30 agenda, from Brazil and major Asian economies to the European Union, are turning from fossil fuel expansion toward real delivery on clean energy and climate goals. The most resilient economies will be those building the next energy era—one that’s defined by efficiency, electrification, and innovation that delivers opportunity for people and communities.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/oil-refinery-air-pollution-communities-mississippi-river-chalmette-louisiana-91db4d3aab.jpg?h=7a7e2eb2&itok=2PzqPIXW,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:55.330035

Notably, one of the US’s largest solar projects, the 6.2GW Esmerelda project in Nevada, was cancelled last month after the Bureau of Land Management scrapped its environmental review, a key part of the permitting process.

Solar and other clean energy technologies have faced growing political headwinds from president Donald Trump’s government, with the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed over the summer scaling back the availability of tax credits brought in under the previous government. This is despite solar and storage being widely regarded as the quickest to meet the burgeoning demand for power from AI, data centres and manufacturing.

Based on an analysis of data from the US Energy Information Administration, SEIA stated that 73GW of solar and 43GW of planned storage projects had not yet received all necessary federal, state, and local permits to proceed and thus faced being stuck in “limbo”.

It said that 18 states have over 50% of their planned electricity capacity at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are expected to lead the country in data centre growth. For example, in Texas, SEIA said over 44GW of solar and storage projects are at risk between now and 2030, accounting for nearly 40% of the country’s at-risk projects.

“Despite declaring an ‘energy emergency’, this administration is threatening half of planned power from reaching the grid. America’s solar and storage industry is ready to build, save customers money, and strengthen the grid. We just need Washington to get out of the way,” SEIA said in a statement.

SEIA stated that actions by the administration, including enhanced federal permitting rules, the cancellation of grid upgrades and the creation of uncertainty in the American energy market, meant projects were being cancelled or facing extensive delays. Notably, one of the US’s largest solar projects, the 6.2GW Esmerelda project in Nevada, was cancelled last month after the Bureau of Land Management scrapped its environmental review, a key part of the permitting process.

“Under Washington’s new energy permitting bureaucracy, projects large and small are being trapped in limbo. And this extends well beyond projects on public lands. Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews,” SEIA said.

The trade body said that developers who have already secured local zoning approvals, completed environmental studies and worked closely on projects with nearby communities are finding they are unable to move forward because their projects must still consult with federal agencies before construction can begin.

“This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host,” SEIA said. “It sends a chilling message to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if you play by the rules, the federal government can still pull the plug. This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty that businesses need to plan for the future.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arevon-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:10:18.107081

For water and electric utilities, it is critical to communicate with customers about potential leaks, rate changes and outages. Speed and clarity are essential to ensuring water is not wasted and customers know about outages. This boosts customer satisfaction.

Until recently, the water services department for the city of Bryan, Texas, communicated with its customers about these issues by calling or sending field crews to homes and putting door hangers on their doorknobs, said Kala Jeske, a data specialist with the city’s water services department.

With this communication system, the water services department often needed to field phone calls from customers with questions about issues such as outages. In addition, sending field crews door-to-door tied up personnel and resources such as trucks.

But in the spring of 2024, the department transitioned to using TextPower, which can send automated texts or allow users to manually send group texts. The water services department began receiving fewer phone calls from customers. Fewer employees and trucks were dispatched to the field. Customers said they liked the change to texting.

“We’ve received a lot of positive feedback from customers,” said Jeske.

“For outage notifications, typically our field staff went door to door with door tags. Now we can push out alerts to those customers,” said Jeske. Those alerts – which could include notifications about work being done on the water system – reduce the number of calls from customers about irregularities such as bubbles in the water.

Texting is also yielding efficiencies for the city’s electric utility – Bryan Texas Utilities (BTU). BTU has a separate account with TextPower because BTU has customers not served by the water department.

“There are several benefits to texting,” said Meagan Brown, public information officer at BTU. “From the utility perspective, TextPower replaces some manual labor so we can explore other ways to improve the system.” Additionally, in the digital age, customers expect communication about outages to be as immediate as possible. “This makes for happier customers,” she said.

Texting not only saves time and resources, but it can also boost the response rate from customers.

In fact, one of TextPower’s other city customers was using postcards and emails to reach customers and only yielding an 8% response rate. By using text, the response rate jumped to over 50%.

The city of Bryan’s water services department is now learning about how to best take advantage of texting, said Jeske.

To inform customers of water leaks, the city uses TextPower’s Group Tag feature to text groups of customers that have been flagged as having continuous water usage, which can be caused by a leak.

“I manually push out an alert,” Jeske said. “We don’t want to automatically push them out in case the leak has stopped.”

Communicating quickly about leaks – allowing customers and the utility to take swift action – benefits both the utility and the customer by significantly reducing wasted water and saving money.

“We have another customer that saves tens of thousands of gallons of water every month from early leak detection alert programs,” said Mark Nielsen, TextPower’s co-founder & Executive Chairman.

The city of Bryan also uses the TextPower platform to communicate about upcoming water outages or unplanned outages.

In the past, the water department hung door tags on doorknobs to inform customers of these issues, said Jeske. Being informed as early as possible about upcoming outages – caused by contractors interconnecting new water customers nearby, for example – gives customers time to find alternative sources of water such as bottled water. And that improves customer satisfaction.

Along with alerting customers about leaks and outages, a water department’s messaging must also include communication with crews in the field.

The city of Bryan’s water department has equipped its field crews with iPads to help with this effort. With the iPads, crew members can use TextPower to draw a circle around an area experiencing outages and send group texts to the customers living within that circle.

“We added a point for each location and included customer contact information,” said Jeske. “Crews can pull up a map on an iPad and draw a shape around the houses they want to send notifications to. It will build a list of phone numbers and they can push their alerts out in one group.”

This helps ensure that the water department reaches only the right customers with appropriate information, and doesn’t contact unaffected customers.

Just as important, the city’s water department can also send a message informing customers that their water service has been restored. The message might also tell customers that they should flush their lines if there’s sediment in their water. This also reduces the numbers of calls from customers, saving time and resources and improving customer satisfaction.

Currently, the water department is rolling out TextPower slowly so it can gather feedback as it deploys the system. “We went live the first week in June. Long term, we plan to expand our outreach,” said Jeske.

To help customers understand the transition to texting, the water services department deployed a social media campaign to address customers’ initial confusion over receiving texts.

“Once we got over that, people were appreciative,” Jeske said.

Next summer, the water department’s outreach efforts might include sending alerts about wastewater rate setting. The rates are based on water usage in December, January and February. The goal is for customers to understand in advance that conserving water during that time frame will lower their rates.

“We want to do conservation notices when we get into wastewater rate setting so customers are not surprised if rates change,” Jeske said. “Some customers irrigate year-round, and it affects their water rates. They can lower their rates by conserving.”

Water utilities have a number of other ways to take advantage of TextPower. They include account shut-off notifications, payment due reminders, disaster emergencies, boil water alerts, service appointment reminders, pipe corrosion inspection notifications and real-time customer surveys.

Such features allow water utilities to streamline communications, better inform customers – boosting satisfaction – and improve efficiency, all while substantially reducing operating costs.

Like the water utility, the city of Bryan’s electric utility is also using TextPower to get messages to customers quickly, said Brown. The electric utility has a separate TextPower account because BTU has more customers, and some of those customers aren’t served by the water utility. In addition, separating the two accounts allows customers to opt out of texts from either the water utility or BTU. It also allows the two departments to be billed by TextPower separately, so that TextPower’s text fees can be properly allocated to each department.

“We don’t want to mix the two departments,” said Brown. The water department has about 20,000 customers, and BTU has 68,000 customers, one-third of whom are located in rural areas.

Because all of BTU’s meters are smart meters, BTU can automate its TextPower messages. BTU does this by linking the TextPower platform with BTU’s outage management system, allowing the system to communicate directly with TextPower, Brown said. Again, that’s a timesaver for the utility.

The ability to integrate existing software with TextPower is available to all TextPower customers through a comprehensive set of APIs. “TextPower gives utilities a great deal of flexibility to utilize texting and integrate it with in-house or third-party software,” said Mark Nielsen, executive chairman and co-founder of TextPower.

Before BTU began using TextPower to inform customers of outages, the utility would rely on communicating with local media and posting on social media to get the word out.

Now, if a large number of customers are affected by an outage, TextPower will send a message telling the customers that BTU is aware of an outage in the area and instructs them to visit the company website for updates about the outage. Once power has been restored, TextPower notifies customers.

“We use a logic-based algorithm,” Brown said. “If it detects an outage on a device – fuses, breakers, transformers – and 15 people are affected, TextPower will send a text to the people affected.”

Using TextPower, users can report outages by merely sending a one-word text message: “Out.”

Such messaging is critical during storm-related emergencies, which are growing in frequency.

When Hurricane Beryl hit Texas in July, BTU sent out 12,700 text messages. The utility had more than one outage, and some affected only two people, others impacted thousands, said Brown.

Without the ability to text customers, electric utilities often are inundated with calls during outages. Utilities have reported that using texting – rather than other communication modes – reduces the number of calls customers make to the utility by 70% or more, said Nielsen.

Speed is also an advantage. When an outage threat looms, texting helps get the word out as quickly as possible.

When Texas utilities experienced electricity shortages in the winter of 2021 during Winter Storm Uri, many utilities used TextPower to proactively communicate about rolling blackouts and ask customers to reduce their electricity usage, said Nielsen.

“Generally, it was very effective. There was a significant amount of usage by Texas utilities in communicating the need for load curtailment. Customers were very appreciative and more responsive to texts,” he said.

For BTU, outage text messaging generally takes place automatically, with no human interaction. In conjunction with the Outage Management System (OMS), TextPower can be used to communicate outages that are predicted or only verified outages.

This is important to BTU because the outage management system may predict outages on three lines, when an outage may only affect one line. This might result in sending messages to more people than just those who are out of power. By only sending a text after the outage is verified by BTU personnel, it provides more accurate information being delivered to the end customer.

“We have to use our best judgment,” Brown said.

BTU customers also receive texts about planned outages. If, for example, the utility has to replace a transformer that might impact 20 houses, Brown can instruct TextPower to text those homeowners before the event. In the past, BTU sent out crews to hang notices on doorknobs.

In the future, BTU may use TextPower to inform customers about curtailing load when BTU is facing high demand. Texting would help keep customers informed during such important events and help BTU grapple with the challenges of electricity shortages.

“Implementing TextPower has allowed us to better communicate and serve our community, which is our goal,” said Brown.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:47.282310

GWEC’s Japan country manager Takeshi Matsuki said: “Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region.
OWC’s Japan country manager Masataka Nakagawa said: “Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy.
The white paper sets out short-term and long-term recommendations focused on three key areas: auction reform, offtake mechanisms and market bottlenecks.
GWEC said its next step will be to establish a bridging forum to foster dialogue between government and industry, helping shape a transparent and predictable policy framework for Japan’s offshore wind expansion.","Japan must urgently reform its offshore wind auction system and establish a public-private forum to guide policy and investment if it is to regain momentum in its clean energy transition, according to a new white paper by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and renewable energy consultancy OWC.

The report, Unlocking Japan’s Offshore Wind Potential: Strategic Pathways to Overcome Market Bottlenecks and Drive Industrial Growth, warns that without structural changes to the current auction framework, Japan risks major delays in meeting its decarbonisation and energy security goals.

Japan has completed three rounds of offshore wind auctions to date, but the sole Round 1 bidder has since withdrawn, while the winners of Rounds 2 and 3 face severe financial pressure. The trajectory of these projects, GWEC said, highlights the need for “timely reform and a more effective auction design” that better reflects market realities.

GWEC’s Japan country manager Takeshi Matsuki said: “Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region.

“To put the industry back on a growth trajectory, Japan must pursue auction reforms, reassess offtake mechanisms, and remove critical market bottlenecks. By taking these steps, there is no doubt that offshore wind will remain the backbone of Japan’s power mix on its path toward carbon neutrality by 2050.”

Matsuki said unlocking this potential would deliver “clean, affordable, and locally produced renewable energy,” while stimulating regional economies through job creation and new opportunities for coastal communities.

OWC’s Japan country manager Masataka Nakagawa said: “Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy.

“Recent developments have highlighted the need for structural and institutional reform to ensure project delivery and investor confidence. Timely auction reform, including evaluation criteria optimisation, will be key to accelerating capacity build-out.”

He added that improving offtake mechanisms such as price caps and shifting towards more bankable models — including two-sided Contracts for Difference or Feed-in Tariffs — would help align bids with market conditions, while addressing issues such as certification, curtailment and supply chain visibility would strengthen investor confidence.

The white paper sets out short-term and long-term recommendations focused on three key areas: auction reform, offtake mechanisms and market bottlenecks.

In the near term, GWEC and OWC propose retendering Japan’s Round 1 site and revising evaluation criteria for upcoming rounds to balance price and non-price factors. Longer-term changes include adopting a two-stage auction model and setting Commercial Operation Date-based targets to improve delivery timelines and support domestic manufacturing.

GWEC and OWC presented the findings to Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and Ministry of Environment (MOE) in late October. The ministries have expressed strong interest in the report’s recommendations.

GWEC said its next step will be to establish a bridging forum to foster dialogue between government and industry, helping shape a transparent and predictable policy framework for Japan’s offshore wind expansion.",https://renews.biz/media/21127/credit_gwec-2.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-10 12:09:25.330449

Trump recently crowed about fellow billionaire Bill Gates’s apparent backtracking on climate action, posting on Truth Social: “I (WE!)
“Due to bigger countries’ indifference to climate action, we are off track on the 1.5C goal, and heading towards even more destructive impacts,” she said.
“No country, including the United States that is now being led by an anti-science, increasingly authoritarian Trump administration, can stop global climate action,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
“The question is, is it going to accelerate fast enough, given the dire space we’re in now with the climate crisis?","For years, countries around the world pressed the US to engage with them in addressing the climate crisis and to show it was serious about taking action. Now, with key United Nations climate talks under way in Brazil this week, other nations have been quietly hoping the US stays well away.

Under Donald Trump, who has called the climate crisis “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, the US has not only pulled back from climate action but openly agitated for greater global fossil fuel use and for other countries to tear down their own climate policies.

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” the US president told leaders at a UN speech in September. “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”

There was an air of relief among some diplomats, then, when the White House said that no high-level representatives would attend the Cop30 summit in Belém, Brazil, this week. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” a White House spokesperson said.

American commitment to curb global heating has waxed and waned over the years but the US now appears to not only be uninterested, but actively fighting for the other side. “Before, it was benign neglect, even in Trump’s first term,” said a former senior state department official. “Now it’s quite the opposite. They don’t want to participate and don’t want others to, either.

“If the choice is no US or a US that is there as a spoiler, to wreck and disrupt things, then I think most countries would prefer there to be no US,” the former official added. “I mean, we are now to the right of Saudi Arabia, when you think about it. The Saudis negotiate hard but they are OK with the Paris agreement. They aren’t against the word ‘climate’.”

Trump was not, as expected, present at a leaders summit held last week as a curtain raiser for Cop30, although the US president loomed over the event, with the leaders of Colombia and Chile calling him a liar for his rejection of climate science.

The US position on climate has hit a nadir, more hostile than during Trump’s first term or under George W Bush, when the US refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol, according to Todd Stern, a lead climate negotiator for the US during Barack Obama’s presidency.

“The president has made it clear he wants to withdraw from the Paris agreement, so it doesn’t surprise me they aren’t sending anyone because they aren’t engaged in this,” Stern said. “I don’t think they would add anything useful. This is a much more aggressive administration now, across the board.”

Any sort of US presence at the Belém talks, where countries will work through new emissions-cutting targets and topics such as climate finance, could have repeated extraordinary scenes seen when countries met in London last month to rubber-stamp plans for a small levy on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

US representatives at the talks were accused of using bully-like behavior to force countries to drop the plan, reportedly issuing threats of higher fees for docking in American ports and even visa restrictions upon US travel for negotiators and their families. Trump had called the proposal a “global green new scam tax on shipping” and demanded it be blocked. The tactics appear to have paid off, with the pollution fee now delayed for at least a year.

“It would have had a microscopic effect on the US economy, particularly compared to Trump’s tariff warfare, and yet they went into full thug tactics to batter that down at the very last minute,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator.

While the US is unlikely to show up in Brazil at all – the state department’s office that dealt with climate issues is now shuttered and there was no US presence at UN climate meetings in Germany and then Peru this year – Whitehouse said countries should still be wary of an “Al Capone-style attack” from the Trump administration at Cop30, possibly upon a European Union mechanism to tax imports based on the amount of planet-heating pollution they create.

“I think if you allow yourself to be intimidated by this administration, they will seize all the ground that you cede them, and then come back for more,” he said. “It’s only when you stop and fight and push back that you have a chance.”

Embracing an unapologetic “drill, baby, drill” approach, Trump has struck individual deals to ramp up fossil fuel production with countries such as Japan and South Korea, as well as extracting a promise from the European Union to purchase more US oil and gas.

The EU’s climate rules have been targeted by the White House, as have windfarms in the UK. “We don’t do wind because wind is a disaster,” Trump said during a press conference with Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, in September. “It’s a very expensive joke, frankly.”

Although Trump has torn up climate policies and halted renewable energy projects in the US, this is unlikely to stymie the energy switch globally. The world is set to build nearly 4,600 gigawatts of clean power between now and 2030, the International Energy Agency recently found, which is nearly double the amount built over the previous five-year period which was, in turn, double the amount installed in the five years before that.

“The thing about climate change is that you can’t hold back the waves,” said Stern. “There’s irreversible, strong, vigorous motion towards clean energy across the world.

“This administration might want to go back to the future but it’s not going to happen. The countries at Cop won’t be paying any attention to the United States at the national level.”

But Trump’s antipathy toward climate action is just the most pointed manifestation of a general malaise in global climate politics in recent years. Governments are more intent to be seen fighting inflation than carbon pollution and almost every country is not doing enough to cut emissions or provide finance to those worst affected by worsening floods, storms and droughts.

Some climate advocates have become drawn to other issues or have even downplayed the severity of the crisis. Trump recently crowed about fellow billionaire Bill Gates’s apparent backtracking on climate action, posting on Truth Social: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”

The most vulnerable countries are now casting around to see whether any leaders will now step up. “The US’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement leaves a void that must urgently be filled,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which advocates for low-lying countries most threatened by a hotter world.

Seid said smaller, developing countries do not have the resources to recover from the sort of devastation wrought by enormous storms such as Hurricane Melissa, which last month smashed into Jamaica and was probably worsened by an overheated atmosphere and ocean.

“Due to bigger countries’ indifference to climate action, we are off track on the 1.5C goal, and heading towards even more destructive impacts,” she said. “This is a poignant illustration of the disproportionate, unjust effect on the vulnerable people who have contributed the least to climate change.”

The US government may be absent, but roughly 100 US governors, members of Congress and state and city officials will still go to Belém to argue that a vast chunk of the US is still committed to dealing with the climate crisis. The task at Cop30 will be to keep despair at bay, until a rapidly heating world can again focus on the climate emergency that is exacerbating many of the other problems now drawing attention.

“No country, including the United States that is now being led by an anti-science, increasingly authoritarian Trump administration, can stop global climate action,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The question is, is it going to accelerate fast enough, given the dire space we’re in now with the climate crisis? We have this rapidly shrinking window. The science is absolutely stark.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350d61e62dcec4bd84b1bbc9858b606974c87caf/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6af0caaddda9b4601a0068f0b9300e5c",N,,2025-11-10 10:05:04.915588

Take Control of Your Indoor Air Air pollution research and regulatory frameworks continue evolving as administrations change and priorities shift.","The Environmental Protection Agency closed its Human Research Facility in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during summer 2025, eliminating a unique laboratory that studied how air pollution affects human health through controlled exposure studies. This closure occurred months before a new health strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission recommended that EPA and the National Institutes of Health study air quality impacts on children's health.

The MAHA Commission Recommendations

The Make America Healthy Again Commission released a strategy document on September 10, 2025, containing 128 recommendations for improving health and addressing chronic diseases. According to reporting by Ariel Wittenberg for Politico, the strategy specifically states that EPA and the National Institutes of Health ""will study air quality impacts on children's health and utilize existing research programs to improve data collection and analysis.""

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin unveiled the strategy at a press conference, with Zeldin stating the work would include ""the work of our chemicals, air and water programs."" Both officials referenced using ""gold standard science"" to fulfill the report's objectives.

At the announcement, Zeldin stated: ""Protecting human health and the environment while powering America's comeback isn't just about serving Americans today, it's about ensuring future generations inherit clean air, water, and the foundation for healthy lives.""

The Human Research Facility's Unique Capabilities

The Chapel Hill facility represented one of the only laboratories in the United States capable of conducting controlled human exposure studies to air pollution. Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association, explained: ""It was one of the only places in the country where you could put humans in a chamber and measure their reaction to ozone. Those studies have long informed our understanding of how much of these pollutants are safe to breathe.""

The laboratory contained nine sealed chambers where volunteers agreed to exposure to air pollution at levels matching those found in major cities around the world. EPA researchers monitored volunteers' vital signs and collected blood samples, enabling them to uncover specific information about how different air pollutants—including ozone, vehicle exhaust, and wildfire smoke—impact human health.

Before the laboratory's establishment in the 1990s, epidemiologists could broadly link increased deaths to high levels of particulate matter in air. The Human Research Facility's controlled studies helped connect specific pollutants to specific health effects. For example, research at the facility linked exposure to particulate matter pollution to increased heart rates in people with preexisting cardiac conditions.

Research Applications and Regulatory Impact

The laboratory's research informed multiple aspects of public health protection. Studies conducted at the facility helped shape air quality alerts that notify the public when pollution levels pose health risks. The research also underpinned major federal air regulations, including those limiting smog-forming emissions.

The controlled exposure methodology allowed researchers to isolate specific pollutant effects that would be difficult or impossible to determine through observational studies alone. By exposing volunteers to known quantities of specific pollutants in controlled conditions, scientists could definitively establish causal relationships between exposures and physiological responses.

Betsy Southerland, who worked at EPA's Office of Science and Technology for 30 years and now volunteers for the Environmental Protection Network, stated: ""We had this state-of-the-art facility, and they canceled the lease.""

Broader Research Program Changes

Beyond closing the Human Research Facility, EPA moved to dissolve its Office of Research and Development during summer 2025. This action involved terminating a large proportion of staff and relocating others to a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions within the Office of the Administrator.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch responded to questions about how EPA could fulfill the MAHA report's directives without these programs, stating: ""We are confident EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment and fulfill all statutory obligations.""

Hirsch added that the new applied science and environmental solutions office ""will align research and put science at the forefront of the agency's rulemakings.""

Regulatory Changes Affecting Air Emissions

Concurrent with the research program changes, EPA proposed modifications to regulations controlling emissions of various pollutants. The agency announced plans to rescind multiple air pollution limits established during previous administrations, including regulations controlling mercury emissions, smog-forming ozone, and fine particulate matter.

A carbon rule finalized in 2023 would have prevented an estimated 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital and emergency room visits, 1,900 new asthma diagnoses, and 360,000 asthma attacks in 2035 by limiting pollution of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, along with fine particulate pollution and smog-forming nitrogen oxides, according to EPA estimates at the time of finalization.

EPA announced it would rescind that regulation in March 2025, along with 11 other air pollution limits. One regulation targeted for rescission limited mercury emissions from power plants. If it had remained in place, that regulation would have reduced emissions of the neurotoxin by more than 16 percent by 2028, according to analysis by EPA scientists.

Scientific Community Perspectives

Phil Landrigan, an environmental epidemiologist and pediatrician who leads Boston College's Global Public Health Program, noted the extensive research foundation supporting mercury emission regulations. ""All of that is well-established science, there is nothing new there,"" he stated regarding the existing body of evidence on mercury's health impacts including increased asthma risk, heart disease, stroke, and brain damage.

Natural Resources Defense Council senior attorney John Walke characterized air quality and its health impacts as ""one of the most researched and studied and reported phenomena across the world.""

Laura Kate Bender of the American Lung Association summarized the situation: ""There will be more air pollution to study, and fewer funds and staff with which to do it.""

The University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture helps producers do just that through its Arkansas Discovery Farms Program.

The Discovery Farms team documents water quality, soil health, climate effects and resource use in research at 18 private farms across the state's diverse agricultural sectors. The team also provides demonstrations and educational outreach to promote sustainable farming.

""The overall goal of the program is to document sustainable and viable farming systems that remain cost-effective in an environmentally sound manner,"" said Mike Daniels, a distinguished professor in the crop, soil and environmental sciences department at the University of Arkansas.

Examples of climate change parameters the Discovery Farms team monitors in the network of private, working farms include greenhouse gases and soil carbon in poultry, livestock, row crops, forestry and horticulture operations.

At each site, Daniels said the team evaluates conservation practices based on the farm owner's priorities, which often coincide with regional water or soil quality issues common to many producers in the area. Faculty from the Cooperative Extension Service and Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, the Division of Agriculture's outreach and research arms, collaborate with federal and state agencies promoting conservation of natural resources.

""In essence, the program uses research tools and equipment installed on private farms to conduct routine monitoring to help producers assess and improve their use of natural resources by using an age-old, time-proven extension technique of working directly with farmers on their land,"" Daniels said.

The team -- made up of faculty and staff from the Division of Agriculture and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff -- recently received the Excellence in Extension Team Award from the Association of Southern Region Extension Directors. The award was presented Aug. 19 at the association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The association includes extension directors from 13 southern states and two territories -- Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

""Through cutting-edge monitoring tools and extensive outreach, the Arkansas Discovery Farms program demonstrates how sustainable agriculture benefits both the environment and the economy, positioning Arkansas as a leader in conservation and agricultural resilience,"" said Rich Bonanno, executive director of the Association of Southern Region Extension Directors.

POSITIVE IMPACTS

Water quality monitoring over the past 15 years indicates that less than 5% of nitrogen and phosphorus applied as fertilizer or manure is recovered in edge-of-field water runoff.

""By quantifying runoff volume, we have been able to demonstrate that improved irrigation water management can increase irrigation water remaining in the field from 60% to 90%,"" Daniels said.

The Arkansas Discovery Farms team shares its findings through virtual field trips that have educated thousands of farmers, students and policymakers, said John D. Anderson, senior associate vice president for agriculture for the division and director of the Cooperative Extension Service.

""We're proud of the collaborative work we're doing with Arkansas farmers,"" Anderson said. ""Being good stewards of our natural resources while ensuring sustainability of our state's top industry benefits everyone.""

As part of the program, a Discovery Farms Education Center on the UAPB farm adjacent to campus will give students hands-on experience in monitoring the impact of soil and water conservation on natural resources.

The Arkansas Discovery Farms team includes the following people:

Mike Daniels -- Distinguished professor of crop, soil and environmental sciences and Discovery Farms co-leader, UADA;

Kris Brye -- University professor of applied soil physics and pedology in crop, soil and environmental sciences, UADA and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas;

States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries.
Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.
The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.","Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.

But as we chart this path toward a more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will power it.

The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.

Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage. Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.

Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.

Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.

Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.

To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.

Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.

In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:59.455205

Jerry Brown, who got a hero’s welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump’s first term.
The Brazilian hosts billed this year’s climate talks as a chance to turn lofty promises into results.
Ken Alex, a former senior policy adviser to Brown who’s traveled with him to several international climate talks, said climate diplomats know where to look for a stand-in from the United States under a Trump administration.
“Countries and other places in the world start reaching out to California because the U.S. is missing.”","“The reason I’m here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States,” he continued. “There is a different picture that we can paint subnationally.”

It’s a well-rehearsed role for California, which has staked out a leading role in international climate diplomacy for decades under both Democratic and Republican governors. The Trump administration’s dismantling of climate policies to favor oil and gas interests — and planned absence from the Brazil talks — only give California more space to fill, said former Gov. Jerry Brown, who got a hero’s welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump’s first term.

“Trump, he’s saying one thing,” Brown said in an interview. “Newsom is saying something else, very important.” The impact, he said, will be determined in Belém. “That’s why it’s exciting. There’s not an answer yet.”

The conflict was already taking shape last week. At an energy conference in Greece, U.S. and Greek officials touted a new deal for Exxon Mobil to explore drilling in the Mediterranean, with U.S. Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum saying, “there is no energy transition, there is just energy addition.” In Brazil, meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for an economy free of oil and natural gas during an opening speech to the climate talks, saying, “Mr. Trump is against humankind.”

That gives Newsom an opening — and also presents a risk. Where Brown led a coalition of states eager to demonstrate continued commitment on climate in Trump’s first term, Newsom will arrive in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River, at a time when U.S. politics are tilting rightward and even Democrats are pulling back on embracing climate policies.

California’s own claim to climate leadership has also lost some shine. Trump laid waste to its nation-leading vehicle emissions standards, getting Congress to overturn them in June, and state regulators have yet to propose making up the emissions losses. Other blue states were already getting cold feet about following California’s rules, citing the cost of switching to electric vehicles and equipment. Newsom himself has backtracked on some policies, including a profit cap on refineries, an acknowledgment that high gas prices are a liability. And while the state has met its own emissions targets so far, it was off track to meet its 2045 carbon neutrality goal even before the federal government began attacking renewable energy.

Newsom argues that Trump’s policies are hurting competitiveness. “China is sprinting ahead on clean energy to a scale and degree that I don’t think most Americans fully appreciate, and I’m deeply worried about how they will outpace this country and how we may not be able to catch up,” he said.

Amid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom’s profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers declined to comment on Newsom’s attendance at COP but pushed back on his embrace of low-carbon energy.

“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam,” she said in a statement. “These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda!”

There’s little Newsom’s team, which includes ex-State Department climate negotiators, can actually do to influence the closed-door talks reserved for countries. Instead, the team is focusing on expanding its list of voluntary bilateral or multilateral agreements with other subnational and national governments, some of which have been purely symbolic and some of which have led to research and policy exchanges. Among the most substantive are agreements with Chinese provinces, some dating back to Brown’s time but which paved the way for Newsom to take a headline-generating trip to China focused on climate change in 2023.

Now, amid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally-watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom’s profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.

Newsom’s agenda in Belém includes a first-ever meeting with Jochen Flasbarth, Germany’s Secretary of Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, on Tuesday. The two are expected to discuss and renew a climate agreement their predecessors first signed in 2017. Newsom is also scheduled to meet with Thekla Walker, the environment minister for the German state of Baden-Württemberg, which in 2015 co-founded the Under 2 coalition with California for states and cities looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

He’s also expected to give plenary remarks at COP in Belém later this week, where top-tier global involvement is lacking. The Brazilian hosts billed this year’s climate talks as a chance to turn lofty promises into results. But no sweeping agreement is on the table, and many countries are behind on their emissions goals.

Only a smattering of European leaders are in attendance, and the European Union’s 27 member countries could not agree on a climate goal to present at the conference until mere days before its start — and only after watering down existing pollution-cutting rules to get a deal. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former U.N. climate representative, stayed home. Also absent is Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country tops the U.S. as the world’s No. 1 greenhouse gas polluter but is also moving aggressively towards renewable electricity.

The Brazilian organizers have pivoted toward implementation — focusing on things cities and states can do on their own, from forest protection to electric vehicles and disaster resilience. That will leave at least some in the crowd of government officials, NGOs and industry groups hungry for input from California, with its massive economy and Democratic-leaning population. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, named Newsom as the person she expected to generate the most chatter in Brazil.

“It is already predictable that, of course, Gavin Newsom will get quite a bit of media attention because he represents the huge state of California, but also because of his high-profile pushback on President Trump,” she said in an interview.

Ken Alex, a former senior policy adviser to Brown who’s traveled with him to several international climate talks, said climate diplomats know where to look for a stand-in from the United States under a Trump administration.

“Gov. Newsom is seeing the same thing we saw in the Brown administration,” he said. “Countries and other places in the world start reaching out to California because the U.S. is missing.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F16%2F7e%2Fac52d3064fa98c7d0e4aa8ebb9ae%2Felection-2025-redistricting-california-44447.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:12.505271

The decline in BEV sales could have been more severe without several OEMs increasing their own incentives in October to help make up for the loss of the federal credit. According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per unit on BEVs totaled $13,161, up $2,047 compared to September 2025. It remains to be seen what the natural demand for BEVs will be in the absence of the credit, but we do expect it will take quite some time for BEV sales to reach the rate they were in the final months of the EV tax credits.

Our outlook for the rest of the year is for a slower sales pace relative to Q3 2025. Given the pull-ahead sales that occurred earlier this year, a slower Q4 won’t necessarily impact full-year sales totals too much. We expect sales will be flat or up slightly compared to full-year 2024.

The rise of 'don't say climate' politics. - Grist Magazine,Kate Yoder,,,,,https://grist.org/language/florida-adaptation-dont-say-climate-politics-bill-gates/,"The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes.
You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country.
Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control.","Last May, as blistering-hot weather broke records across South Florida and smoke from distant wildfires in Mexico turned the sky hazy, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, signed legislation erasing most mentions of “climate change” from state law. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” he wrote on X.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.

“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A United Nations report last week found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.

“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.

The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, starting on November 10. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.

“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.

Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.

“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by the end of the century.

“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”

There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones — highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.

Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.

“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Miami-Beach-shoreline-construction.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:17.079453

Kaufman,,,,,https://heatmap.news/am/cop30-new-york-pipeline,"The company hasn’t announced any partnerships with data center operators to date — though hyperscalers are certainly investing in the Indian market.
Until then, he said, he had 350 electricians working on a Meta data center project between Augusta and Atlanta.
Monterey Bay is surrounded by Monterey County and Santa Cruz County and both are considering ordinances around battery storage.
It’s important to say how important battery storage is going to be for the coastal areas.
Lawmakers in the state have been really behind energy storage and keeping things headed in that direction of more deployment.","“Obviously some Trump administration policies have weakened the business case for renewables and therefore also storage,” Eugene Beh, Quino’s founder and CEO, told me when I asked what it was like to fundraise in this environment. “But it’s actually outside the US, where the appetite still remains very strong.”

The deployment of battery energy storage in India lags far behind the pace of renewables adoption, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for the sector. “India does have an opportunity to leapfrog into a more flexible, resilient, and sustainable power system,” Shreyes Shende, a senior research associate at Johns Hopkins’ Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab, told me. The government appears eager to make it happen, setting ambitious targets and offering ample incentives for tech-neutral battery storage deployments, as it looks to lean into novel technologies.

“Indian policymakers have been trying to double down on the R&D and innovation landscape because they’re trying to figure out, how do you reduce dependence on these lithium ion batteries?” Shende said. China dominates the global lithium-ion market, and also has a fractious geopolitical relationship with India, So much like the U.S., India is eager to reduce its dependence on Chinese imports. “Anything that helps you move away from that would only be welcome as long as there’s cost compatibility,” he added

Beh told me that India also presents a natural market for Quino’s expansion, in large part because the key raw material for its proprietary electrolyte chemistry — a clothing dye derived from coal tar — is primarily produced in China and India. But with tariffs and other trade barriers, China poses a much more challenging environment to work in or sell from these days, making the Indian market a simpler choice.

Quino’s dye-based electrolyte is designed to be significantly cheaper than the industry standard, which relies on the element vanadium dissolved in an acidic solution. In vanadium flow batteries, the electrolyte alone can account for roughly 70% of the product’s total cost, Beh said. “We’re using exactly the same hardware as what the vanadium flow battery manufacturers are doing,” he told me minus the most expensive part. “Instead, we use our organic electrolyte in place of vanadium, which will be about one quarter of the cost.”

Like many other companies these days, Beh views data centers as a key market for Quino’s tech — not just because that’s where the money’s at, but also due to one of flow batteries’ core advantages: their extremely long cycle lives. While lithium-ion energy storage systems can only complete from 3,000 to 5,000 cycles before losing 20% or more of their capacity, with flow batteries, the number of cycles doesn’t correlate with longevity at all. That’s because their liquid-based chemistry allows them to charge and discharge without physically stressing the electrodes.

That’s a key advantage for AI data centers, which tend to have spiky usage patterns determined by the time of day and events that trigger surges in web traffic. Many baseload power sources can’t ramp quickly enough to meet spikes in demand, and gas peaker plants are expensive. That makes batteries a great option — especially those that can respond to fluctuations by cycling multiple times per day without degrading their performance.

The company hasn’t announced any partnerships with data center operators to date — though hyperscalers are certainly investing in the Indian market. First up will be getting the company’s demonstration plants online in both California and India. Quino already operates a 100-kilowatt-hour pilot facility near Buffalo, New York, and was awarded a $10 million grant from the California Energy Commission and a $5 million grant from the Department of Energy this year to deploy a larger, 5-megawatt-hour battery at a regional health care center in Southern California. Beh expects that to be operational by the end of 2027.

But its plans in India are both more ambitious and nearer-term. In partnership with Atri, the company plans to build a 150- to 200-megawatt-hour electrolyte production facility, which Beh says should come online next year. With less government funding in the mix, there’s simply less bureaucracy to navigate, he explained. Further streamlining the process is the fact that Atri owns the site where the plant will be built. “Obviously if you have a motivated site owner who’s also an investor in you, then things will go a lot faster,” Beh told me.

The goal for this facility is to enable production of a battery that’s cost-competitive with vanadium flow batteries. “That ought to enable us to enter into a virtuous cycle, where we make something cheaper than vanadium, people doing vanadium will switch to us, that drives more demand, and the cost goes down further,” Beh told me. Then, once the company scales to roughly a gigawatt-hour of annual production, he expects it will be able to offer batteries with a capital cost roughly 30% lower than lithium-ion energy storage systems.

If it achieves that target, in theory at least, the Indian market will be ready. A recent analysis estimates that the country will need 61 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by 2030 to support its goal of 500 gigawatts of clean power, rising to 97 gigawatts by 2032. “If battery prices don’t fall, I think the focus will be towards pumped hydro,” Shende told me. That’s where the vast majority of India’s energy storage comes from today. “But in case they do fall, I think battery storage will lead the way.”

The hope is that by the time Quino is producing at scale overseas, demand and investor interest will be strong enough to support a large domestic manufacturing plant as well. “In the U.S., it feels like a lot of investment attention just turned to AI,” Beh told me, explaining that investors are taking a “wait and see” approach to energy infrastructure such as Quino. But he doesn’t see that lasting. “I think this mega-trend of how we generate and use electricity is just not going away.”

“We had challenges as we were building a new supply chain for a new technology and then workforce,” John Williams, an executive at Southern Nuclear Operating Company, which owns over 45% of Plant Vogtle, said in a webinar hosted by the environmental group Resources for the Future in October.

“It had been 30 years since we had built a new nuclear plant from scratch in the United States. Our workforce didn’t have that muscle memory that they have in other parts of the world, where they have been building on a more regular frequency.”

That workforce “hasn’t been building nuclear plants” since heavy construction stopped at Vogtle in 2023, he noted — but they have been busy “building data centers and car manufacturing in Georgia.”

Williams said that it would take another “six to 10” AP1000 projects for costs to come down far enough to make nuclear construction routine. “If we were currently building the next AP1000s, we would be farther down that road,” he said. “But we’ve stopped again.”

J.R. Richardson, business manager and financial secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers Local 1579, based in Augusta, Georgia, told me his union “had 2,000 electricians on that job,” referring to Vogtle. “So now we have a skill set with electricians that did that project. If you wait 20 or 30 years, that skill set is not going to be there anymore.”

Richardson pointed to the potential revitalization of the failed V.C. Summer nuclear project in South Carolina, saying that his union had already been reached out to about it starting up again. Until then, he said, he had 350 electricians working on a Meta data center project between Augusta and Atlanta.

“They’re all basically the same,” he told me of the data center projects. “They’re like cookie cutter homes, but it’s on a bigger scale.”

To be clear, though the segue from nuclear construction to data center construction may hold back the nuclear industry, it has been great for workers, especially unionized electrical and construction workers.

“If an IBEW electrician says they're going hungry, something’s wrong with them,” Richardson said.

Meta’s Northwest Louisiana data center project will require 700 or 800 electricians sitewide, Richardson told me. He estimated that of the IBEW’s 875,000 members, about a tenth were working on data centers, and about 30% of his local were on a single data center job.

When I asked him whether that workforce could be reassembled for future nuclear plants, he said that the “majority” of the workforce likes working on nuclear projects, even if they’re currently doing data center work. “A lot of IBEW electricians look at the longevity of the job,” Richardson told me — and nuclear plants famously take a long, long time to build.

America isn’t building any new nuclear power plants right now (though it will soon if Rick Perry gets his way), but the question of how to balance a workforce between energy construction and data center projects is a pressing one across the country.

It’s not just nuclear developers that have to think about data centers when it comes to recruiting workers — it’s renewables developers, as well.

“We don’t see people leaving the workforce,” said Adam Sokolski, director of regulatory and economic affairs at EDF Renewables North America. “We do see some competition.”

He pointed specifically to Ohio, where he said, “You have a strong concentration of solar happening at the same time as a strong concentration of data center work and manufacturing expansion. There’s something in the water there.”

Sokolski told me that for EDF’s renewable projects, in order to secure workers, he and the company have to “communicate real early where we know we’re going to do a project and start talking to labor in those areas. We’re trying to give them a market signal as a way to say, We’re going to be here in two years.”

Solar and data center projects have lots of overlapping personnel needs, Sokolski said. There are operating engineers “working excavators and bulldozers and graders” or pounding posts into place. And then, of course, there are electricians, who Sokolski said were “a big, big piece of the puzzle — everything from picking up the solar panel off from the pallet to installing it on the racking system, wiring it together to the substations, the inverters to the communication systems, ultimately up to the high voltage step-up transformers and onto the grid.”

On the other hand, explained Kevin Pranis, marketing manager of the Great Lakes regional organizing committee of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, a data center is like a “fancy, very nice warehouse.” This means that when a data center project starts up, “you basically have pretty much all building trades” working on it. “You’ve got site and civil work, and you’re doing a big concrete foundation, and then you’re erecting iron and putting a building around it.”

Data centers also have more mechanical systems than the average building, “so you have more electricians and more plumbers and pipefitters” on site, as well.

Individual projects may face competition for workers, but Pranis framed the larger issue differently: Renewable energy projects are often built to support data centers. “If we get a data center, that means we probably also get a wind or solar project, and batteries,” he said.

While the data center boom is putting upward pressure on labor demand, Pranis told me that in some parts of the country, like the Upper Midwest, it’s helping to compensate for a slump in commercial real estate, which is one of the bread and butter industries for his construction union.

Data centers, Pranis said, aren’t the best projects for his members to work on. They really like doing manufacturing work. But, he added, it’s “a nice large load and it’s a nice big building, and there’s some number of good jobs.”

A couple things are going on. Monterey Bay is surrounded by Monterey County and Santa Cruz County and both are considering ordinances around battery storage. That’s different than a ban – important. You can have an ordinance that helps facilitate storage. Some people here are very focused on climate change issues and the grid, because here in Santa Cruz County we’re at a terminal point where there really is no renewable energy, so we have to have battery storage. And like, in Santa Cruz County the ordinance would be for unincorporated areas – I’m not sure how materially that would impact things. There’s one storage project in Watsonville near Moss Landing, and the ordinance wouldn’t even impact that. Even in Monterey County, the idea is to issue a moratorium and again, that’s in unincorporated areas, too.

It’s important to say how important battery storage is going to be for the coastal areas. That’s where you see the opposition, but all of our renewables are trapped in southern California and we have a bottleneck that moves power up and down the state. If California doesn’t get offshore wind or wind from Wyoming into the northern part of the state, we’re relying on batteries to get that part of the grid decarbonized.

In the areas of California where batteries are being opposed, who is supporting them and fighting against the protests? I mean, aside from the developers and an occasional climate activist.

The state has been strongly supporting the industry. Lawmakers in the state have been really behind energy storage and keeping things headed in that direction of more deployment. Other than that, I think you’re right to point out there’s not local advocates saying, “We need more battery storage.” It tends to come from Sacramento. I’m not sure you’d see local folks in energy siting usually, but I think it’s also because we are still actually deploying battery storage in some areas of the state. If we were having even more trouble, maybe we’d have more advocacy for development in response.

Has the Moss Landing incident impacted renewable energy development in California? I’ve seen some references to fears about that incident crop up in fights over solar in Imperial County, for example, which I know has been coveted for development.

Everywhere there’s batteries, people are pointing at Moss Landing and asking how people will deal with fires. I don’t know how powerful the arguments are in California, but I see it in almost every single renewable project that has a battery.

Okay, then what do you think the next phase of this is? Are we just going to be trapped in a battery fire fear cycle, or do you think this backlash will evolve?

We’re starting to see it play out here with the state opt-in process where developers can seek state approval to build without local approval. As this situation after Moss Landing has played out, more battery developers have wound up in the opt-in process. So what we’ll see is more battery developers try to get permission from the state as opposed to local officials.

There are some trade-offs with that. But there are benefits in having more resources to help make the decisions. The state will have more expertise in emergency response, for example, whereas every local jurisdiction has to educate themselves. But no matter what I think they’ll be pursuing the opt-in process – there’s nothing local governments can really do to stop them with that.

Part of what we’re seeing though is, you have to have a community benefit agreement in place for the project to advance under the California Environmental Quality Act. The state has been pretty strict about that, and that’s the one thing local folks could still do – influence whether a developer can get a community benefits agreement with representatives on the ground. That’s the one strategy local folks who want to push back on a battery could use, block those agreements. Other than that, I think some counties here in California may not have much resistance. They need the revenue and see these as economic opportunities.

I can’t help but hear optimism in your tone of voice here. It seems like in spite of the disaster, development is still moving forward. Do you think California is doing a better or worse job than other states at deploying battery storage and handling the trade offs?

Oh, better. I think the opt-in process looks like a nice balance between taking local authority away over things and the better decision-making that can be brought in. The state creating that program is one way to help encourage renewables and avoid a backlash, honestly, while staying on track with its decarbonization goals.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjEzMDI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NjYyODEyNX0.-CleOcSTmYOJR1bdnTtdE_px-4UPjU__n4lFbk6HF1U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-10 09:20:04.086079

Chevron to provide guidance through end of this decade

Oil firm has opportunities for growth after Hess

Investors eye updates on Kazakhstan talks and new power ventures

Reuters) – When Chevron executives and top shareholders convene in New York City on Wednesday for the oil producer’s investor day, portfolio managers will be eager to hear CEO Mike Wirth’s plan to finally reap rewards from the Hess acquisition and begin a new phase of growth.

The event is lining up to be a victory lap for Wirth after the company prevailed in an arbitration battle to clinch the $55 billion takeover of the smaller oil producer in July.

After oil and gas reserves hit a low point in 2024, investors also want more details about exploration plans, especially with major operations in Kazakhstan and the U.S. hitting a stride. They already had some good news last month, when Chevron reported record oil and gas production for the third quarter.

“Pre-Hess, the view was that Chevron had very little room to grow. But now, with the Kazakhstan project moving into cash generation and Hess on top of that, it gives them a lot of different opportunities for growth,” said Will Su, a managing director at asset management firm BlackRock, one of

The Hess acquisition came with a key 30% stake in the Stabroek block in Guyana that is operated by Exxon Mobil. The area holds at least 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent and was a driving force behind the upbeat third quarter report.

Wirth said during the earnings call that Chevron will provide guidance through the end of this decade at the investor day, its first since 2023.

WHAT NEXT FOR EXPLORATION?

Details about Wirth’s goal to improve exploration and find new sources of oil and gas is expected to be an important part of the agenda, especially as its other flagship projects mature.

Chevron said in August it reached one million barrels per day of production from the Permian Basin, a figure it will hold steady as it reduces capital spending and focuses on cash generation. An expansion project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan is now operating at full capacity.

With intensive spending in the rearview mirror on two major assets, Chevron should have more capital available for exploration, said David Byrns, a portfolio manager and senior investment analyst at American Century Investments, which holds a $254 million position in the oil producer according to LSEG data.

Chevron’s cost-cutting efforts should also allow it to protect dividends and buybacks, he added.

“They leaned out the organization because there’s a recognition that the industry will need to allocate more dollars (to exploration) in the future, but it wouldn’t be wise for that to happen at the expense of cash return to shareholders,” Byrns said.

UPDATES ON KAZAKHSTAN AND OTHER PROJECTS

Byrns added that he is watching for developments in Chevron’s eastern Mediterranean assets and potential plans to monetize natural gas reserves to power data centers.

Chevron is in talks with major AI companies to build natural gas-fired power plants to provide the vast amounts of electricity needed to operate data centers, which is a new business venture for the company. Some remain uncertain about the idea, however.

“I’m on the fence about their power strategy and I think a lot of other (investors) would like more details as well,” said Priyal Maniar, an investment analyst at T. Rowe Price, another major Chevron shareholder.

Maniar added she hoped to hear updates about Chevron’s negotiations to extend its contract in Kazakhstan. It expires in 2033 and is already prompting regular questions from analysts on earnings calls.

During the third quarter call, Wirth said the talks were off to a good start but cautioned that discussions are in early stages.

“These are going to take some time. It’s a complex contract,” he said.

“Every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels — and clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide.
Clean energy is rising.
African delegates, a statement from the bank said, highlighted the continent’s critical role in global climate stability.
“The African Development Bank warmly welcomes Brazil’s historic ‘Tropical Forest Forever’ initiative,” Ould Tah said, calling it a milestone in global climate solidarity.","The United Nations (UN) has stated that despite the $2 trillion investments in renewable energy last year, overshooting the 1.5°c global temperature agreed by nations of the world now seems impossible.

Secretary General of the UN, António Guterres, speaking at the Energy Transition Roundtable at the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30), in Belém, Brazil, called for people-centred investment in grids as well as end to fossil fuel subsidies.

The 1.5°C global temperature idea refers to a global warming limit that countries agreed to try to stay under, mostly to avoid the most dangerous and irreversible climate impacts. It means limiting the increase in the earth’s average temperature to no more than 1.5°C above what it was before the Industrial Revolution (around the late 1800s). The world has already warmed by roughly about 1.2°C.

“Last year, 90 per cent of new power capacity came from renewables; global investment in clean energy reached $2 trillion — $800 billion more than fossil fuels; renewables are now the cheapest source of new electricity in nearly every country. They are powering prosperity and empowering communities long left in the dark.

“Every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels — and clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide. The renewables revolution is here. But we must go much faster — and ensure all nations share the benefits.

“At COP28, countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner; and to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. The mandate is clear — now we must close the delivery gap.

“And this, Excellencies, is where we are falling dangerously short. Even if new national commitments are fully implemented, the world is still heading for clearly more than 2°C of warming. That means more floods, more heat, more suffering — everywhere. Scientists tell us that overshooting 1.5°C is now inevitable — starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. But how high and how long that overshoot lasts depends on the speed and scale of our actions today,” the UN chief stated.

To return below 1.5°C by century’s end, he pointed out that global emissions must fall by almost half by 2030, reach net zero by 2050 and go net negative afterwards.

According to him, the first thing to do is to provide clarity and coherence and align laws, policies and incentives with a just energy transition; and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies that distort markets and lock us into the past.

“Second, put people and equity at the centre of the transition; support workers and communities whose livelihoods still depend on coal, oil and gas; provide training, protection and new opportunities — especially for young people and women.

“Third, invest in grids, storage and efficiency. Renewables are surging, infrastructure must catch up — fast. Fourth, meet all new electricity demand with clean power — including from the data centres driving the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Technology must be part of the solution, not a new source of strain,” he added.

Guterres stated that the fifth thing to do is to unlock finance at scale for developing countries, stressing that today, Africa receives 2 per cent of global clean energy investment and insisting that the world needs international cooperation to tear down barriers, cut the cost of capital and crowd in private investment.

“The pathways for each country may look different, but the destination must be the same: A net-zero world, followed consistently by a net negative world — powered by renewables. We must support developing countries to implement their commitment to transition away from fossil fuels: Through stronger cooperation, investment and technology transfer — and calibrated to different capacities and dependencies.

“Let us move with speed and solidarity. Make fairness the engine of acceleration — and build economies that are clean, inclusive and resilient.Turn climate necessity into development opportunity — everywhere. The fossil fuel age is ending. Clean energy is rising. Let us make the transition fair, fast and final,” the UN Secretary General stressed.

Meanwhile, the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group President, Sidi Ould Tah, has reaffirmed the institution’s commitment to transforming “promises into progress,” highlighting the bank’s status as the first multilateral development institution to achieve financing parity between climate adaptation and mitigation.

Speaking at the Belém Climate Summit, which brings together world leaders in Brazil ahead of COP30 to review progress on the Paris Agreement, Dr Ould Tah underscored the Bank’s determination to intensify climate action.

“We are all gathered here, driven by our collective responsibility to protect nature, our most precious asset in combating climate change and ensuring humanity’s survival,” he told the plenary during a session on Climate and Nature: Forests and Oceans.

African delegates, a statement from the bank said, highlighted the continent’s critical role in global climate stability. The Republic of Congo noted that Africa—home to 17 per cent of the world’s tropical forests—loses an estimated 3.7 million hectares annually, while Nigeria’s Vice President Kashim Shettima called for new mechanisms to safeguard forests and oceans.

“What Africa is asking for is equitable access to the carbon market to enable countries to restore forest and ocean resources,” Shettima said.

Bank president Ould Tah emphasised that Africa’s ecosystems are not just natural assets but vital climate regulators. “The Congo Basin is a compelling example — it holds the world’s largest tropical peatlands, storing about 29 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to three years of global emissions,” he said.

He outlined the Bank’s climate strategy, guided by its four cardinal points, which focus on mobilising capital for green growth, promoting debt-for-nature swaps, empowering women and youth in environmental protection, and investing in resilient, nature-friendly infrastructure.

Also, Ould Tah joined Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to launch the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a global fund designed to support countries sharing the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as other tropical forest regions.

“The African Development Bank warmly welcomes Brazil’s historic ‘Tropical Forest Forever’ initiative,” Ould Tah said, calling it a milestone in global climate solidarity. “This visionary partnership aligns with our biodiversity programs, such as the Congo Basin Forest Fund and the Central African Forests Commission,” he added.

As COP30 negotiations resume on November 10 (today), delegates are expected to pursue progress on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance, which commits developed countries to mobilise at least $300 billion annually by 2035 for developing nations.

With those commitments yet to materialise, the AfDB said it is helping the continent explore innovative financing solutions.

CBP began detaining silicon solar cells made by South Korean-headquartered Qcells earlier this summer.
The lack of adequate solar cell supply means that Qcells cannot complete panel assembly at its Georgia manufacturing plants, thus requiring the temporary reduction in working hours.
A similar CBP detention has been affecting Maxeon, a solar panel manufacturer with some Chinese financing but no documented connection to forced labor happening in China.
Maxeon sold its European, Asian and Latin American sales channels and entities, while keeping its Mexican assembly plant and moving forward with plans for a 2-GW solar panel factory in New Mexico.","Solar panel manufacturer Qcells revealed on Friday that it would furlough one-third of its workers at its two plants in Georgia. The 1,000 employees will temporarily have reduced pay and working hours due to increased detentions by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of solar cells and other upstream panel components. Qcells will also lay off 300 workers from staffing agencies at the two plants.

The federal government has stepped up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the United States. CBP began detaining silicon solar cells made by South Korean-headquartered Qcells earlier this summer. Qcells has repeatedly stated that its products do not use Chinese components. The company has a long history of using polysilicon from fellow South Korean company OCI and uses component manufacturing in Southeast Asia.

The lack of adequate solar cell supply means that Qcells cannot complete panel assembly at its Georgia manufacturing plants, thus requiring the temporary reduction in working hours. Despite Qcells being one of the first domestic manufacturers to start construction on new solar cell and wafer manufacturing operations, the company is still only performing panel assembly in the United States.

A similar CBP detention has been affecting Maxeon, a solar panel manufacturer with some Chinese financing but no documented connection to forced labor happening in China. Maxeon’s Mexico-assembled panels have been prevented from entering the country since summer 2024, despite the company providing thousands of pages of documents demonstrating full compliance in UFLPA. Maxeon has resorted to filing a complaint with the U.S. Court of International Trade and is awaiting updates amidst the government shutdown.

In Maxeon’s case, the once-global company now only focuses on the U.S. market. Maxeon sold its European, Asian and Latin American sales channels and entities, while keeping its Mexican assembly plant and moving forward with plans for a 2-GW solar panel factory in New Mexico. With most of its products unable to get into the country, Maxeon financials have nosedived. The company reported $39 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, whereas it reached $371 million for the same period in 2024. Plans for the U.S. factory have paused.

Marta Stoepker, Qcells senior director of corporate communications, said in a statement to local news that the company was forced to scale back production “while our shipments into the U.S. were delayed in the customs clearance process.

“Qcells expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months. Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains,” she continued. “We will soon be back on track with the full force of our Georgia team delivering American-made energy to communities around the country.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/qcells-factory.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 08:59:04.670218

States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries.
Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.
The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.","Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.

But as we chart this path toward a more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will power it.

The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.

Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage. Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.

Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.

Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.

Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.

To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.

Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.

In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x6831762777540.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=tD811nCE,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:33.485312

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate.
The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.
The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.
The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.","California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority states have never had before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act — who is also a law professor at UCLA — first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a slam dunk for California to step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung peoples’ eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn't necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting cars with new regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals. “

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It's something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No downside to trying, and some upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There's a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You're buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don't think there's much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a ""no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That's usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who's serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world's fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e4cd60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+11/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F18%2F96%2F9023a31f45fca374a4d13f1bd8b6%2F030223-los-altos-ev-sk-cm-16.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:26.328881

This story was originally published by Vox and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.

That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.”

The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance.

Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030—when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/e32fe4e60967b2faa0cc8d32427b3271af63fc94.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-10 08:01:58.758520

Duke Energy’s annual shareholder meeting in May appeared to be the acme of corporate comfort. The Charlotte-based utility’s leadership, featuring recently appointed CEO Harry Sideris, sat in cushy, grey padded chairs, accompanied by tasteful, white floral arrangements and potted green ferns.

It was all smiles and reassuring tones as they glided through shareholder proposal votes and plans to invest $83 billion in electricity generation and transmission over the next five years.

Yet when the presentation turned to shareholder queries, a disruption broke the placid surface. “Just a reminder that I’m reading these questions word-for-word as they were submitted,” said Duke Vice President of Investor Relations Abby Motsinger.

“‘Will you please stop all DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] activities and fire all DEI function workers?’” Motsinger read. Her eyes closed and lips pursed into a frown before the camera cut to Sideris. The CEO stared straight ahead as he addressed the question.

“We respect that there are a lot of differing viewpoints on this social issue,” said Sideris. “First and foremost, let me emphasize that we’ve always had a merit-based approach to hiring—our employment decisions have always been, and still are, based on skills, experience, capabilities, and performance.”

“But it is also our experience that building a diverse workforce with different perspectives and experiences, as well as creating an inclusive workplace, makes us stronger and more resilient,” Sideris continued. “We see diversity as a competitive advantage, ultimately benefiting our employees and the customers we serve. We understand and value that everyone has a difference of opinion on this topic, and we will always remain compliant with the applicable laws and governmental requirements at the federal and state levels.”

If Duke Energy still regards diversity as an advantage, however, it has been less keen to champion its value. In the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests, Sideris’s predecessor Lynn Good told investors that Duke would “continue to advocate for change, stand up for justice and ensure the communities where we work and live are provided with equal opportunities.”

Duke has also taken a more muted position on other initiatives investors commonly lump together as a shorthand for responsible corporate citizenship: environmental, social, and governance, or ESG.

In 2022, the utility published a full ESG report, calling it “one of our most important annual publications” and its principles “essential to who we are.” This year, the acronym and the phrase it represents were entirely absent from company communications, and the 2022 report appears to have been removed from its website (though a copy of the document is available through the nonprofit Internet Archive).

Duke is far from alone in making this shift. Across both North Carolina and corporate America, many companies have pulled back from bold social statements and shed thousands of jobs tied to diversity efforts since a peak in 2023. Many fear the wrath of President Donald Trump’s administration, which recently called ESG “a Marxist march through corporate culture.”

But activists argue that Duke’s stance—or failure to take one—is particularly important. The utility is the fourth-most valuable company headquartered in North Carolina and a leader among the state’s corporate citizens. It’s faced racial justice issues since at least 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court found the company was discriminating against Black workers in a landmark case. Environmental groups have put pressure on the company as well, pointing to data that shows Duke Energy has placed polluting infrastructure like coal ash ponds in predominantly minority communities. They also suggest the company’s future plans for power generation could overburden the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Duke itself hasn’t been clear about the extent to which changes in how it talks about ESG relate to changes in practice. Over a series of email exchanges, Duke spokespeople first said that the company planned to comment, then that a response was being considered for approval, and then declined.

“We have decided to sit this one out and we look forward to working with you on future stories,” spokesperson Shawna Berger finally wrote, two months after The Assembly’s initial outreach.

Under the Radar

The clearest examples of Duke’s shifting messaging can be found in its proxy statements and 10-K forms, which are annual reports the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to submit informing their shareholders about the firm and its plans.

Documents Duke released in early 2024 featured both internal and external programs meant to further social and environmental goals. The latest iterations omit substantial parts of that language.

On diversity, last year’s 10-K includes references to an executive-level “Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Council,” “aspirational goals” for workplace representation of women and people of color, and partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities aimed at “building a diverse and highly skilled talent pipeline.”

The 2024 proxy statement highlights employee discussions to “support an inclusive workplace,” along with “diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity [and] gender” as desired qualities for board members.

None of those references show up in the 2025 10-K or proxy statement, and Duke declined to respond to an extensive series of questions regarding the status of its DEI efforts.

Sue Sturgis, a Raleigh-based researcher with the California nonprofit Energy & Policy Institute, said these annual reports are signals to shareholders about where Duke is headed. If something is eliminated, an investor would reasonably conclude it’s no longer a company priority.

“I would presume, as an investor, that what I’m seeing in these documents are statements about material realities,” Sturgis said. “These are not just press releases.”

Attempts to independently verify the status of specific Duke DEI programs yielded mixed results. For example, the utility announced in 2018 that it had joined the HBCU Partnership Challenge spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat who represents most of Charlotte. Adams’ office did not respond to questions about whether Duke Energy remains a partner.

Comment requests about Duke’s DEI work to the state chapter and national leadership of the American Association of Blacks in Energy, a nonprofit of which many Black Duke employees are members, were either unacknowledged or declined.

In 2019, Duke touted its work with the N.C. Governor’s HBCU Internship Program, a UNC System initiative, to bolster workforce diversity. But Andy Wallace, a UNC spokesperson, confirmed that the company has not been involved with the program since at least 2021.

In other cases, Duke appears to be continuing support for programs, particularly at HBCUs, though it no longer mentions that work in public communications. Jordan Howse, spokesperson for the North Carolina A&T State University’s College of Engineering, confirmed that the utility has continued to back its HOME Program, but declined to share specifics. At North Carolina Central University, Duke Energy continues to support an internship for law students and a dual-degree program for physics and math students, said spokesperson Quiana Shepard, but she did not provide current funding levels.

Another effort Duke has continued is a free laptop program with the Davidson-based nonprofit E2D. The company highlighted its support to distribute computers to students at 10 North Carolina HBCUs in a 2024 blog post, but hasn’t mentioned the program since then. When it was announced, E2D President Pat Millen said Duke’s leadership was “setting a new standard for corporate responsibility in North Carolina.”

In a recent interview, Millen said Duke’s commitment hasn’t changed and has helped provide more than 5,000 computers a year, along with volunteer hours and financial support. But he acknowledges that companies (and nonprofits like his both face “difficulties associated with how the White House wants us to perceive certain words and certain phrases.”

E2D’s laptop program now explicitly targets first-generation college students rather than HBCUs, though most students receiving computers already met that criterion, Millen said. The nonprofit made that change independently, he said, and not due to pressure from Duke or other business partners. Still, he recognizes that the shift may provide some donors political cover by not tying their gifts to race or diversity initiatives.

“Specific language seems to matter more at this moment than at any other time I can recall,” Millen said. “That said, we are proud to be leaning even harder into our core principles than ever, and our first-gen work, if anything, represents a broader and more expansive expression of E2D’s and our partners’ impact.”

The Bottom Line

Duke has also pulled back on its environmental positioning. This year’s 10-K drops a previous claim that the company was “advancing regulatory models that support carbon and methane emission reductions.”

Instead, the utility now seeks to “leverage regulatory models that support the delivery of reliable energy, timely cost recovery, and affordable customer rates.”

In Duke’s proxy statement, the company removed two full pages outlining plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. It also eliminated language that claimed the company’s carbon reduction goals were in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty meant to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

And Duke leaders now have weaker financial incentives to accelerate the company’s green transition. Progress on “energy modernization”—formerly called “clean energy”—now accounts for 10 percent of bonus pay, down from 12.5 percent in 2024. Changes to that bonus goal also no longer reward executives for boosting battery storage or expanding customer-owned rooftop solar. Company spokespeople declined to comment on any of these points.

As with its diversity language, Duke’s environmental messaging is responding to a new political landscape, said Mikaela Curry, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in North Carolina.

But Curry believes the difference here is that the company sees economic opportunity in pivoting. She pointed to Duke signing on to a January letter to Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, asking him to roll back regulations on emissions and coal ash cleanup that it claimed were “unnecessary costs on the power sector.”

At the state level, the utility lobbied for Senate Bill 266, legislation passed this July that eliminated a previous requirement to reduce carbon emissions 70 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. (The company must still reach net-zero emissions by 2050.) Duke’s latest plan for meeting North Carolina’s projected power needs takes advantage of the delay in targets to add more gas plants, extend the life of existing coal plants, and delay building wind and hydropower infrastructure. It adds less utility-scale solar than the company had planned in 2023, even though it’s among the cheapest available sources of power.

The changes benefit Duke financially, as state regulations provide the utility an approximately 10 percent return on equity for power plants it builds.

Another 2021 state law requires Duke Energy to purchase 45 percent of its solar power from third parties, a cost it can pass on to ratepayers but does not yield a return on capital investment. Because the law does not require that for other sources of power, Duke profits more from building and operating its own gas power plants.

“The company will take advantage of any opportunity that it can to advance its own interests,” Curry said, “and those interests are not always necessarily aligned with the best interests of North Carolinians.”

Charging Ahead

Duke is certainly not acting in a political vacuum. The Trump administration has threatened companies it deems “the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners” with civil compliance investigations; in a recent appearance at the United Nations, Trump lambasted “the green energy scam.”

The North Carolina General Assembly is moving in a similar, if less rhetorically florid, direction. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed the measure eliminating the 2030 emission targets, but the Republican-majority overrode that veto with the help of three Democrats.

The N.C. Utilities Commission, which regulates Duke Energy, came under majority Republican control after the passage of legislation last December that removed an appointment from the governor. The most recently appointed commissioner, Donald van der Vaart, has denied the scientific consensus on humanity’s role in climate change and the health dangers of greenhouse gases.

Duke’s shareholders, like others across the country, don’t seem to be showing a particular appetite for progressive policies. According to investment firm Morningstar, the average support for shareholder resolutions on ESG has dropped to 16 percent, down more than half from a peak of support a few years ago.

Bryant Sewell, the co-executive director of the shareholder advocacy group Majority Action, said he encouraged Duke shareholders to vote against reelecting then-CEO Good and Lead Director Michael Browning to the company’s board in 2021 over what he called a failure to act on the climate crisis and racial equity.

Those votes didn’t come close to unseating the two leaders, but this year’s campaign against reelecting board members Theodore Craver and Robert Davis received even less shareholder support.

“Particularly in the electric utility sector, [companies] have made enough progress to where investor attention has been diverted elsewhere,” Sewell said.

But in a political landscape hostile to environmental and social activism, Sewell said, outside pressure on private companies may become even more important—at least to get shareholders to consider the potential impacts of climate change on their investments.

“Particularly in this moment where there’s government retrenchment, these institutional investors are critical players that can make or break our future,” he said. “I think that’s really important for people to know and to factor into not just their financial decision-making, but their decision-making around what kind of world we want to see and live in.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP146589517236-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 08:23:20.347050

Emma Green’s piece provided a thorough examination of the effects that the Trump Administration’s attacks on higher education are having on research (“Degrees of Hostility,” October 20th). After twenty-four years of teaching at a suburban public university—one that primarily serves working- and middle-class students—I find that this is not the aspect of the Administration’s actions that frightens me most. What I see today is that, under Donald Trump’s direction, critical thinking is under assault. Across disciplines, Trump’s agenda threatens one of higher education’s core missions—to teach the next generation to think critically about power’s relationship to knowledge. When the search for knowledge is subsumed by ideology, we’re no longer in the business of education so much as that of teaching people to accept the dictates of official power.

According to Gallup, the share of Americans who view college as “very important” has declined sharply in recent years, from seventy-five per cent in 2010 to thirty-five per cent today. Many commentators have framed this as a symptom of anti-intellectualism. In my opinion, what this transition really reflects is decades of capitalist individualism. We stopped treating higher education as a shared civic good, and started selling it as a private investment promising personal prosperity. When the investment failed to pay off as promised, public trust collapsed.

In this respect, universities bear some blame for their own decline. Chasing privilege, tuition revenue, and rankings has blurred their mission. Green shows how federal strategy has weaponized this distrust by building on a feeling, already possessed by much of the public, that universities are not public partners but misbehaving contractors. This strategy deepens the cynicism that it exploits. If we want people to value higher education again, we must stop marketing it as a luxury with uncertain returns, and restore it to the status of a public good with collective benefits.

I appreciated the insightful piece by Green, but, as an architect, I wish that she had refrained from architectural criticism. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building, in Washington, D.C., is not, as Green calls it, an “ugly” “concrete shoebox” but an elegant example of International Style modernism, and an important part of our capital’s modernist heritage.

When it opened, in 1961, Federal Building No. 6, as it was then called, was lauded as the first modernist building in the capital’s monumental core, befitting the very modern mission of one of its first occupants, NASA. The austere structure, made of limestone (not concrete) and glass, demonstrated the compatibility of modern design with D.C.’s classicism—a concept that has since been attacked by Trump’s regressive executive order on “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” which aims to purge modern architecture from the federal real-estate portfolio. Just as this Administration seeks to diminish or eliminate social-welfare agencies—the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the list goes on—it is moving to dispose of the mid-century-modern buildings that house them.

Disbursements from the landmark Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Products Liability Litigation settlements with 3M and DuPont began this past summer for eligible water systems that submitted claims documentation on time. For many systems, awards from these settlements will be in the many millions of dollars, much needed funds to upgrade their facilities with PFAS treatment technology or to pay themselves back for investments already made to remove PFAS from their source water and comply with new EPA regulations.

It is now time for water systems eligible for the next phase of the 3M and DuPont settlements to ensure they submit their claims ahead of next year’s deadlines in order to access the funds available to them. These “Phase Two” systems are those that did not detect PFAS in their water (any PFAS, at any concentration) until after June 22, 2023, so long as they serve a population of more than 3,300 people or were otherwise required to test for PFAS under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 5 (UCMR-5). (Community systems of any size are eligible under the DuPont settlement, but not the 3M settlement, if they were required to test for PFAS under state law.)

A Potentially Overlooked Funding Source: The Special Needs Fund

For Phase Two water systems, deadlines are drawing near. The “Action Funds,” which compensate systems based on the levels of PFAS in each of their sources and the size of those sources, will account for the primary stream of settlement payments, but utilities should not overlook an additional source of support: the Special Needs Funds. This lesser known benefit of the settlements could mean substantial cost recovery for systems that have already incurred PFAS response costs and/or will incur such costs before Aug. 1, 2026. Utilities can be eligible for both funding streams, and with the 2026 deadlines approaching fast, understanding how these settlements funds work is key to ensuring no available dollars are left unclaimed.

Upcoming Deadlines: Testing Expense Reimbursement, the Action Fund and Special Needs Fund

There are three deadlines in 2026 that Phase Two water systems should know about. The first – Jan. 1, 2026 – is the date by which water systems must submit testing cost claims forms for both the DuPont and 3M settlements in order to get reimbursed for their PFAS testing expenses. This funding source is available to all Phase Two water systems – even those that haven’t detected PFAS in their source water – so long as they were not required to test their sources for PFAS under state law.

The second round of deadlines – June 30, 2026, for the DuPont settlement and July 31, 2026, for the 3M settlement – are the dates by which water systems must submit their Action Fund Claims Form. In order to be eligible for compensation under the settlement’s allocation procedures, systems must complete baseline PFAS testing for each water source and submit the lab reports of that testing, together with documentation of the production capacity and annual production of each source, by these deadlines.

The Special Needs Funds deadline is the final deadline in 2026: Aug. 1 for both DuPont and 3M settlements. A water system can apply for the Special Needs Funds, in addition to the Action Funds, if – by Aug. 1, 2026 – it will have spent money on efforts to address PFAS detections in its impacted water sources. Examples include taking contaminated wells offline, designing and building treatment facilities, purchasing replacement water, and/or drilling new wells to provide PFAS-free water sources to communities.

Expenses incurred before the Aug. 1 Special Needs Fund claims deadline may qualify for reimbursement, subject to the claims administrator’s discretion. These claims can offer additional funding beyond recoveries from the Action Fund. Applicants must provide thorough documentation to substantiate the project’s costs. For municipalities that have already invested or need to invest soon in protecting public health and water quality, this represents a valuable chance to recoup some of those unanticipated expenses.

How Phase Two Water Systems Should Prepare to Apply for Settlement Funds

To position your water system for the strongest possible recovery:

Document all PFAS-related costs. Utilities should capture invoices, contracts and staff time associated with their PFAS response. The claims process requires detailed evidence of spending to qualify for Special Needs reimbursement.

Coordinate with legal and finance teams. Working closely with legal counselors, who understand both the legal and financial requirements, will avoid delaying or jeopardizing funding eligibility.

Begin testing immediately. Testing must be completed and results submitted no later than July 2026, but the deadline for testing that can be reimbursed under the settlements is January 1, 2026.

The Upshot for Phase Two Water Systems: Act Now

For many municipalities and water utilities, PFAS-related costs have already strained budgets and delayed critical infrastructure work. The recent historic settlements are holding PFAS polluters accountable and easing that burden, but securing full recovery demands timely action, careful documentation, and awareness of all funding options, including the Special Needs Fund. A law firm with experience in water contamination litigation can take on the hard work of the settlement process, including eligibility review, analysis, strategy and paperwork, all while ensuring deadlines are met.

With major deadlines approaching in 2026, utilities that act now stand the best chance of receiving settlement payouts before the window closes.

Second, long-term and targeted financing will be crucial to develop the critical minerals supply chain.","As COP30 draws close, expectations are high that nations will work to translate climate commitments into on-the-ground action. The summit offers an opportunity to confront the material realities of the clean energy transition, including the need to secure critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, graphite and rare earth elements.

Minerals have long been part of the energy transition conversation. Growing trade tensions, export restrictions and the weaponisation of minerals supply chains have brought the subject to the forefront. A handful of countries, including China, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, control most of the global refining and processing capacity. For instance, China alone controls around 90% of rare earth processing, 70% of global cobalt refining, and over 60% of lithium refining. This dominance is a result of two decades of strategic investment in refining, processing, and manufacturing, while other countries remained dependent on imports. In 2025, China imposed export controls on 12 rare earth elements, and tightened restrictions across the lithium-ion battery supply chain, showing how such concentration exposes the energy transition to strategic risks, from price volatility to potential supply chain disruptions.

The scale of the challenge is immense. The International Energy Agency under Stated Policies Scenario estimates that the demand for lithium can grow fivefold by 2040, while the demand for graphite and nickel might double. Meanwhile, the demand for cobalt and rare earth elements is likely to increase 50-60% by 2040. In short, minerals are fast becoming the new oil of the 21st century: vital, contested, and geopolitically charged. Like oil, the challenge is not just scarcity, it is concentration. The extraction of critical minerals is often geographically limited to resource-rich but economically vulnerable regions. This imbalance exposes developing economies to the risks of extractive dependence, while leaving manufacturing nations vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.

Addressing these risks requires greater diversification and coordinated international engagement. COP30 must embed this agenda, recognising supply chain resilience and equitable access as climate imperatives. Global initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), the Group of Twenty, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity have begun shaping a new architecture for responsible and resilient critical minerals supply chains. Multilateral partnerships like the India–Australia Critical Minerals Partnership (2022), US–Japan–Korea trilateral agreement (2025), and the recent US–Australia mineral framework (2025) and US–Japan framework underscore this momentum. Together, they aim to align trade and investment priorities, foster technology transfer and ensure equitable benefit sharing.

Yet, even as these global frameworks take shape, their success will ultimately depend on the readiness of individual nations to meaningfully participate in the global critical minerals value chain. This includes policy coherence, institutional coordination, infrastructure and human resource development, be it in extraction, processing, manufacturing or recycling. Examples include India’s National Critical Mineral Mission, Australia’s Future Made in Australia bill, and Japan’s Green Transformation Strategy.

The path forward lies in translating global and domestic commitments into practical frameworks that strengthen governance, mobilise resources, and build long-term technological capability.

First, countries must move away from past mining models and instead prioritise sustainability, and robust environmental, social and governance standards across the value chain. Tools like AI-based mineral mapping, digital traceability systems and stronger audit mechanisms can help enhance oversight. Frameworks like the G7 Minerals Action Plan and initiatives such as the MSP and QUAD can be leveraged to ensure wider participation in the setting and implementation of global standards.

Second, long-term and targeted financing will be crucial to develop the critical minerals supply chain. Establishing a global clean minerals investment facility could bridge capital and operational expenditure gaps, enable processing and recycling projects beyond traditional monopoly geographies, and mobilise capital alongside development banks and green financing institutions to ensure risk sharing and a steady capital flow. Such an initiative can also support long-term offtake arrangements and promote equitable access to investment.

Third, advancing technology, refining, and recycling will require coordinated leadership from governments, industry, and research institutions. Governments must create enabling policies and funding mechanisms for technology development and skill-building, while industry should invest in modern infrastructure. Universities and research institutes can drive joint R&D and cross-border training in mining, chemical, and process engineering. Partnerships that connect emerging economies like India, Indonesia, and African nations with technology leaders such as Japan and the US can accelerate progress in processing, recycling, and alternative battery chemistries. Such cooperation not only addresses workforce gaps but also supports a just, inclusive transition by enabling developing economies to participate more equitably in global value chains.

Ultimately, COP30 offers a defining moment to turn mineral diplomacy into climate action, ensuring that the race to decarbonise also becomes a race to cooperate, diversify, and build a just and resilient clean energy future.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/shutterstock_2515442005.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:10:03.893312

Detroit, MI — November 2025

Detroit — the city that once forged America’s iron, engines, and energy — is roaring back to life with a modern-day industrial marvel: the Intelligent Clean Coal Power Stove, a revolutionary home heating and power system that merges AI-driven clean combustion with micro steam-electric generation.

Invented and developed in Detroit, this technology honors the city’s legacy as the Stove Capital of the World — where the largest stove ever built once stood, before a lightning strike destroyed the monument in 2011. Now, in an almost poetic twist, that spark of lightning seems to have reignited Detroit’s furnace of invention.

From Heat to Power — The Reinvention of Coal

The new Detroit design combines three integrated systems into a single unit:

An AI-Controlled Combustion Chamber that burns coal with unprecedented precision — using real-time oxygen sensors and variable-speed fans to ensure complete combustion with minimal waste gases.

A Liquid Scrubber System that bubbles exhaust through ultra-pure circulating water, creating millions of microbubbles that strip toxins, ash, and acidic gases while capturing thermal energy.

A Steam Engine Generator Add-On, which harnesses the recovered heat from the scrubber to produce steam that drives a compact turbine connected to a high-efficiency alternator — charging an onboard battery bank or feeding power into a microgrid.

The result is a multi-function energy system that produces clean heat, clean water, and renewable-like electricity, all from one of America’s most abundant and inexpensive natural resources: Kentucky coal.

“Coal isn’t going away tomorrow,” said inventor Richard Gerber, the Detroit engineer behind the project. “But with intelligence, microbubbles, and smart thermodynamics, it doesn’t have to pollute. We’ve made a 19th-century fuel behave like a 21st-century technology.”

How It Works — The Intelligent Heat Cycle

At the heart of the system lies a self-learning embedded controller. Sensors constantly monitor combustion temperature, oxygen level, CO and SO₂ concentrations, and water quality in the scrubber. The AI adjusts fan speed and airflow to achieve a clean, steady burn that automatically adapts to the user’s heat demand.

The hot scrubber water — now laden with both absorbed heat and trace mineral particles — is routed to a closed-loop heat exchanger. This thermal energy generates pressurized steam, which spins a compact turbine generator, converting excess heat into usable electricity.

The generated power can be:

Stored in batteries for nighttime use or off-grid independence.

Fed into a home inverter to power lights, electronics, or even EV chargers.

Used to run the stove’s own intelligent control system, making it fully self-sustaining.

What remains after energy extraction is purified condensate water and a manageable byproduct — a mineral-rich sludge that can be filtered, dried, and analyzed for potential reuse.

A Return to Detroit’s Iron Heart

Detroit’s legacy in stove and furnace production stretches back more than a century, when cast-iron masterpieces from Michigan-based companies heated homes across America. The city’s foundries, which once poured molten metal for both stoves and engines, are echoed in this new design — blending craftsmanship with circuitry.

“Detroit was the world’s stove capital,” said Gerber. “Now it’s building the world’s smartest stove. The symbolism is powerful — the largest stove ever built was destroyed by lightning, and now we’ve brought it back as a lightning-powered, AI-integrated generator.”

Cheap Heat, Local Fuel, and Energy Independence

Coal remains one of the most affordable domestic energy sources, especially from nearby Appalachian regions such as Kentucky and West Virginia. With modern automation, safe ash handling, and microbubble scrubbers, the Detroit Clean Coal Power Stove offers a way to use local fuel responsibly — producing cheap, clean, independent heat and power.

In an age when home energy prices fluctuate and grid reliability is under pressure, this innovation could redefine rural and urban heating alike. A single household unit could offset both home heating costs and electrical bills, with emission profiles comparable to modern gas furnaces.

The catch? This isn’t grey hydrogen. It’s blue. Natural gas and steam team up to churn out hydrogen and CO₂, and the plan is to lock that CO₂ safely underground. We’re talking 30-plus miles of pipeline, nine injection wells—and even lines threading into protected wetlands around Lake Maurepas.

Why Louisiana?

Ascension Parish sits smack in the middle of “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of petrochemical plants along the Mississippi. About 130,000 people live here, trading pollution for paychecks for decades. Now the promise of “low-carbon” hydrogen is reopening old wounds: can a new plant really dodge adding more health risks?

What’s at Stake?

Production scale: up to 1,700 tonnes of hydrogen per day, if all goes to plan.

Ammonia edge: converting H₂ into a major fertilizer feedstock.

CCS spotlight: trapping emissions underground—but is it as foolproof as they say?

Economic push: billions in investment and dozens of construction jobs hanging in the balance.

Real-World Pushback

Grassroots groups led by Earthworks insist this is greenwashing. They cite the 2020 CO₂ pipeline leak in Mississippi and argue no carbon capture project has truly proven its safety or met its lofty capture targets. Protests, petitions and permit hearings have slowed progress and rattled investors and regulators alike.

Game Plan: De-Risking the Dream

Air Products isn’t throwing in the towel. They’re slicing the project into manageable chunks, inviting partners to take on the riskiest parts—ammonia synthesis and CCS. By spreading the risk, they hope to lock in offtake deals, secure financing and nudge those permits across the finish line.

Strategic Angle

This whole effort leans heavily on U.S. incentives for carbon capture and hydrogen production. Federal tax credits and grants are on the table, but so is intense scrutiny. If this Louisiana blue hydrogen plant pulls it off, it could trigger a wave of similar projects—or highlight the pitfalls of the so-called “low-carbon” route.

Looking Ahead

There’s no final green light yet. The Air Products CEO teases a decision by late 2025, but with permits, partner agreements and community buy-in still unresolved, it’s anyone’s guess. The outcome will show whether blue hydrogen delivers real climate wins—or just props up the fossil fuel era a bit longer.

Financial Statements

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement EVgo’s financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, EVgo uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EVgo uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. EVgo believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of EVgo’s recurring core business operating results.

EVgo believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing EVgo’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. EVgo believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by EVgo’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of EVgo’s business.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the sections titled “Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release includes some, but not all of the following non-GAAP financial measures, in each case as defined below: “Charging Network Gross Profit,” “Charging Network Gross Margin,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue,” “Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss),” “Adjusted Gross Margin,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue,” “EBITDA,” “EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” and “Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets.” With respect to Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets, pursuant to the terms of certain OEM contracts, EVgo is paid well in advance of when revenue can be recognized, and usually, the payment is tied to the number of stalls that commence operations under the applicable contractual arrangement while the related revenue is deferred at the time of payment and is recognized as revenue over time as EVgo provides charging and other services to the OEM and the OEM’s customers. EVgo management therefore uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, including the cash used for, and the return on, its investment in its charging infrastructure. EVgo believes that these measures are useful to investors in evaluating EVgo’s performance and help to depict a meaningful representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling EVgo to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future.

Charging Network Gross Profit, Charging Network Gross Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing EVgo’s financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

EVgo defines Charging Network Gross Profit as total charging network revenue less charging network cost of sales. EVgo defines Charging Network Gross Margin as Charging Network Gross Profit divided by total charging network revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, and (ii) share-based compensation. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as revenue less Adjusted Cost of Sales. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses before (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) bad debt expense (recoveries), and (iv) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, (ii) amortization, (iii) accretion, (iv) interest income, (v) interest expense, and (vi) income tax expense (benefit). EVgo defines EBITDA Margin as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) loss (gain) on investments, (iv) bad debt expense (recoveries), (v) change in fair value of earnout liability, (vi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets as capital expenditures adjusted for the following capital offsets: (i) all payments under OEM infrastructure agreements excluding any amounts directly attributable to OEM customer charging credit programs and pass-through of non-capital expense reimbursements, (ii) proceeds from capital-build funding and (iii) proceeds from the transfer of 30C income tax credits, net of transaction costs.

Management Comments

Stuart Bodden, Ranger’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Today, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of American Well Services, a Permian based well services provider, at a compelling valuation. This transaction galvanizes our role as the leading well services provider, while providing new growth opportunities through additional service lines that complement Ranger’s existing high spec rigs business. AWS, as well as Ranger, have benefitted from customer consolidation in recent history and we strongly believe this combination will create further value. AWS has created a strong platform with 39 well-maintained high-spec rigs that include complementary equipment and well-trained crews that will integrate seamlessly into Ranger. The combined company will become the largest well services provider in the Lower 48 with the most compelling technology in the space. Ranger is excited for the value that it will bring to our shareholders in the future.

“Ranger continues to demonstrate resilience as broader industry conditions fluctuate. Although our financial performance was recently challenged by a difficult macro-environment, I am confident in the strategic positioning and underlying strength of the company. Despite declines in our completion-focused service lines, particularly Coil Tubing in the Rockies, our production-focused business model has kept our operations on firm footing, attracting blue-chip customers who rely on us for their most difficult and demanding projects. Notably, production rig hours in our core HSR segment increased compared to the second quarter, reflecting our disciplined approach and stable demand in this area. We also maintained a strong balance sheet and allocated capital effectively during this period, including an aggressive share repurchase of 667,500 shares and payment of our base load dividend for the quarter. For the year, we have returned $15.6 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, a testament to our cash flow strength, having generated $25.8 million of free cash flow even while navigating challenging market conditions.

We also continue to be energized by the introduction of our ECHO rig, our recently introduced electric hybrid rig that offers an opportunity to convert conventional rigs into a next generation rig with a lower emissions profile, safety enhancements and operational efficiencies. ECHO is a differentiated solution that further solidifies Ranger’s position as the well-service provider of choice. The first two ECHO rigs have been delivered and are being deployed presently. Customer interest remains robust, and we look forward to updating you about our ongoing conversions as clients recognize the value and innovation these rigs bring to their operations.

As we look forward, our continued resilience is only possible with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the support of our customers. Our future success will be defined by their continued outstanding contributions,” concluded Mr. Bodden.

CAPITAL RETURNS AND GOVERNANCE UPDATE

Year to date through September 30th, 2025, the Company has repurchased 945,600 shares of stock for a total value of $11.6 million, net of tax, at an average price of $12.20 per share. Since the share repurchase program’s inception in 2023 through the end of the third quarter of 2025, the Company has repurchased a total of 4,271,400 shares, for a total value of $46.4 million, net of tax.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

For the third quarter of 2025, revenue was $128.9 million, a decrease from $153.0 million in the prior year period, and from $140.6 million in the prior quarter. Quarter over quarter decreases are attributable to reduced operating activity across all service segments.

Cost of services for the third quarter of 2025 was $109.1 million, or 85%, of revenue, relatively flat compared to 84% of revenue in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses were $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, an improvement from $7.0 million in the prior quarter and from $7.1 million in the prior year period.

Net income totaled $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $8.7 million in the prior year period and $7.3 million in the prior quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.05 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $0.39 in the prior year period and $0.32 in the prior quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the third quarter of 2025 was $16.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from $25.1 million in the prior year period, and a decrease of $3.8 million from $20.6 million in the prior quarter. The year over year decrease was driven by lower activity levels from both the prior quarter and the prior year quarter as well as certain non-cash inventory adjustments recorded during the third quarter.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

High Specification Rigs

High Specification Rigs segment revenue was $80.9 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $5.8 million relative to the prior year period and $5.4 million relative to the prior quarter. Rig hours were down to 111,200 from 116,900 in the prior year period and from 117,000 in the prior quarter. Rig hours were down as a consequence of reduction in completion related work and softness in our northern region. Hourly rig rates slightly decreased by 2% to $727 from $741 in the prior year period and from $738 per hour in the prior quarter, a reflection of an increase in standby hours at lower rates during the third quarter of 2025 as customers chose to hold more rigs idle between projects.

Operating income was $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 28%, compared to $13.8 million in the prior year period, and a decrease of $2.0 million, or 17%, compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $15.7 million in the third quarter, down from $19.2 million in the prior year period and from $17.6 million in the prior quarter.

Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services

Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services segment revenue was $30.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, down $1.4 million, or 4%, from $32.2 million in the prior quarter and down $5.2 million, or 14% from $36.0 million for the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year period was largely attributable to reductions in operational activity within coil tubing which is completions focused and declines in our P&A service line year over year as customers have cut back on any non-essential spending. The decrease from the prior quarter was similarly attributable to activity declines in our coil tubing service and some contract roll-over delays in the Torrent service line offset by more recent improvements in P&A activity.

Operating income was $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, down from $6.6 million in the prior year period and from $4.5 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $5.5 million, down from $8.8 million in the prior year period and from $6.6 million in the prior quarter.

Wireline Services

Wireline Services segment revenue was $17.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decline of $13.1 million, or 43%, compared to $30.3 million in the prior year period, and a decline of $4.9 million, or 22%, from $22.1 million in the prior quarter. Our Completions service line reported 1,800 completed stage counts, a decrease of 28% compared to 2,500 in both the prior year period and the prior quarter.

Operating loss was $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a breakeven in the prior year period and an operating loss of $1.2 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $0.4 million, down from $2.7 million in the prior year period and $1.6 million for the prior quarter. Operating income was impacted by non-cash items related to inventory adjustments for explosives within the completions service line.

BALANCE SHEET, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY

As of September 30, 2025, total liquidity was $116.7 million, consisting of $71.5 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $45.2 million of cash on hand. This compares to December 31, 2024 when the Company had $112.1 million of liquidity, consisting of $71.2 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $40.9 million of cash on hand. The Company had no borrowings under its loan facility as of September 30, 2025.

Cash provided by Operating Activities for the year to date period through September 2025 was $44.9 million, compared to $51.8 million in the same period of 2024.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(UNAUDITED)

Note Regarding Non‑GAAP Financial Measure

The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes to be insightful in understanding the Company’s financial results. These financial measures, which include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, should not be construed as being more important than, or as an alternative for, comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures have been included below and are available in the Investor Relations sections of our website at www.rangerenergy.com. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from the reconciliations. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed below from net income or loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, equity‑based compensation, acquisition‑related costs, severance and reorganization costs, gain or loss on sale of assets, significant and unusual legal fees and settlements, impairment of assets, employee retention credit, inventory adjustment, and certain other non‑cash and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance.

The following tables are a reconciliation of net income or loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods, in millions:

Free Cash Flow

We believe Free Cash Flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance, as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of Free Cash Flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Free Cash Flow as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows.

The following table is a reconciliation of consolidated operating cash flows to Free Cash Flow for the respective periods, in millions:",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20251107640155/en/823721/22/RangerLogo-HighResolution-2000x1179.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:52.616194

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country.
Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land.
“The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.
President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — U.N. climate negotiations were expected to begin Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.

André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in “mutirão,” a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.

“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”

Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.

“I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. “The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.

“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said.

The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the negotiations to a potluck dinner.

“Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,” which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. “And it’s obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.”

“The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,” Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.

In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.”

Not only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives,” Stiell wrote.

""So if you can't do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in,"" Nadella added.

Echoing the 1990s dotcom frenzy to build internet infrastructure, today's tech giants are spending unprecedented sums to construct the silicon backbone of the revolution in artificial intelligence.

Google, Microsoft, AWS (Amazon), and Meta (Facebook) are drawing on their massive cash reserves to spend roughly $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 -- backed for now by enthusiastic investors.

All this cash has helped alleviate one initial bottleneck: acquiring the millions of chips needed for the computing power race, and the tech giants are accelerating their in-house processor production as they seek to chase global leader Nvidia.

These will go into the racks that fill the massive data centers -- which also consume enormous amounts of water for cooling.

Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the United States; bringing new high-voltage power lines into service takes five to 10 years.

Energy wall

The ""hyperscalers,"" as major tech companies are called in Silicon Valley, saw the energy wall coming.

A year ago, Virginia's main utility provider, Dominion Energy, already had a data-center order book of 40 gigawatts -- equivalent to the output of 40 nuclear reactors.

The capacity it must deploy in Virginia, the world's largest cloud computing hub, has since risen to 47 gigawatts, the company announced recently.

Advt

Already blamed for inflating household electricity bills, data centers in the United Statescould account for 7 percent to 12 percent of national consumption by 2030, up from 4 percent today, according to various studies.

But some experts say the projections could be overblown.

""Both the utilities and the tech companies have an incentive to embrace the rapid growth forecast for electricity use,"" Jonathan Koomey, a renowned expert from UC Berkeley, warned in September.

As with the late 1990s internet bubble, ""many data centers that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built.""

Emergency coal

If the projected growth does materialize, it could create a 45-gigawatt shortage by 2028 -- equivalent to the consumption of 33 million American households, according to Morgan Stanley.

Several US utilities have already delayed the closure of coal plants, despite coal being the most climate-polluting energy source.

And natural gas, which powers 40 percent of data centers worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, is experiencing renewed favor because it can be deployed quickly.

In the US state of Georgia, where data centers are multiplying, one utility has requested authorization to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators.

Some providers, as well as Elon Musk's startup xAI, have rushed to purchase used turbines from abroad to build capability quickly. Even recycling aircraft turbines, an old niche solution, is gaining traction.

""The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don't have enough power,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum argued in October.

Nuclear, solar, and space

Tech giants are quietly downplaying their climate commitments. Google, for example, promised net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 but removed that pledge from its website in June.

Instead, companies are promoting long-term projects.

Amazon is championing a nuclear revival through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an as-yet experimental technology that would be easier to build than conventional reactors.

Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa in 2029. And the Trump administration announced in late October an $80 billion investment to begin construction on ten conventional reactors by 2030.

Hyperscalers are also investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, particularly in California and Texas.

The Texas grid operator plans to add approximately 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2030 from these technologies alone.

Finally, both Elon Musk, through his Starlink program, and Google have proposed putting chips in orbit in space, powered by solar energy. Google plans to conduct tests in 2027.

Habush Sinykin said the bill is meant to fill a “regulatory void” in Wisconsin, where the only mention of data centers in state statute is for tax incentives.
It comes as recent polling shows a majority of Wisconsin voters — 55 percent — believe the costs associated with data centers outweigh the benefits of those projects.
Stroud said tying the labor provisions and renewable energy investment to data center subsidies makes sure Wisconsinites see a return on their investment.
Electric utilities would also be required to report data centers’ energy usage and sources to the state.","A new bill in the Wisconsin state Legislature would create new rules for data centers aimed at protecting utility customers and ensuring fair pay for the workers building those projects.

State Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, announced the legislation on Thursday. Habush Sinykin and state Rep. Angela Stroud, D-Ashland, issued a memo seeking co-sponsors.

Habush Sinykin said the bill is meant to fill a “regulatory void” in Wisconsin, where the only mention of data centers in state statute is for tax incentives. She called the new proposal “the first of its kind in Wisconsin” and said it aims to establish “clear statewide guardrails.”

“This legislation guarantees water usage and energy consumption transparency, increases the acceleration and adoption of renewable energy sources, insulates ratepayers from the costs of these projects and prioritizes good-paying, family-supporting jobs,” she said.

The bill has already received support from state environmental, ratepayer and labor groups. It comes as recent polling shows a majority of Wisconsin voters — 55 percent — believe the costs associated with data centers outweigh the benefits of those projects.

The bill would require workers building or refurbishing large-scale data centers to be paid either the prevailing wage rate or union wages from a collective bargaining agreement, whichever is higher. Under the bill, the prevailing wage rate “may not be less than a reasonable and living wage,” according to analysis from the Legislative Reference Bureau.

Wisconsin Laborers District Council spokesperson Steve Kwaterski said many union workers are already working on major data center projects, and his organization is in favor of the bill. He said the prevailing wage requirement will help ensure workers receive family-sustaining pay and benefits.

“These are significant economic investments that are taking place,” he said. “You want to make sure that when you are making these investments in the community, that a part of the overall equation is investing in the workforce — the folks who are building the critical infrastructure.”

The legislation also requires data centers receiving Wisconsin’s sales and use tax exemption to meet prevailing wage requirements and receive at least 70 percent of their total annual electricity from renewable sources.

Stroud said tying the labor provisions and renewable energy investment to data center subsidies makes sure Wisconsinites see a return on their investment.

“If we are making public dollars available for private corporations, we need to make sure that these are family sustaining union jobs, and we need to make sure that the investments are beneficial to the public,” Stroud said.

Electric utilities would also be required to report data centers’ energy usage and sources to the state. It also requires water utilities to notify the state if a customer plans to use 25 percent of the utility’s total water usage, and requires data centers to report their water usage to municipalities.

Ryan Billingham, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Conservation Voters environmental group, said the reporting requirements are important because big tech companies behind data centers often don’t like to tell the public what they’re doing.

“They don’t like to tell you how much energy or water they’re going to use,” he said. “Being a Great Lake state, we have to be very, very careful about our water usage.”

Under the legislation, the state would also collect an annual fee from large energy customers based on their peak energy demand. The money collected would be split between a fund supporting energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-income energy assistance, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.’s Green Innovation fund.

The bill also requires utility companies to get the electric rates they offer data center customers approved by the Public Service Commission every other year. The PSC would have authority to determine if those rates are fair and adjust them to be “just and reasonable,” the Legislative Reference Bureau analysis says.

Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, said that would give the PSC more authority to make sure residential customers are protected by creating a new class of customers essentially just for data centers.

“In a case like this, where you have big tech companies involved — and We Energies and other utilities looking to profit from that — it’s so important that there be oversight to make sure that our power prices are affordable and that utilities aren’t just enriching themselves,” Content said.

Under the bill, electric utilities would be required to offer commercial and industrial customers the option to get some or all of their energy from new renewable energy projects. Participating customers would be required to pay costs associated with adding those resources to the grid.

“The legislation ensures that any expansion of the renewable energy infrastructure is not going to be paid for by the ratepayers of that region,” Stroud said.

The bill would need to pass the Republican-controlled Legislature before reaching Gov. Tony Evers’ desk. Habush Sinykin and Stroud, both Democrats, said they’re hopeful the proposal will receive bipartisan support.

“I am hopeful because this legislation creates a statewide framework that is responsible and adheres to Wisconsin’s values for transparency and accountability,” Habush Sinykin said. “People want to know the potential impacts. They want to make sure energy bills aren’t skyrocketing.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/datacenterharvestangela.webp,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:06.406678

To make meaningful progress on climate action, development, and climate finance at COP30, both developing and developed nations will need to recognize and account for these interconnected realities at the negotiating table.","The adoption of the Paris Agreement marked a landmark moment for global climate diplomacy. This year marks the 10-year anniversary of that historic agreement, when 195 countries came to unanimous agreement to adopt a legally binding climate treaty with the goal of keeping the global average temperature rise well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Central to implementing the Paris Agreement are national climate action plans known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), through which countries articulate their national strategies for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change, with updates every five years.

A non-mandatory and complementary plan, the Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy, was intended to situate these commitments within the broader context of countries’ long-term development plans. The first round of NDCs were submitted in 2015 as intended nationally determined contributions, followed by updates and new submissions in 2020/21. The next round of submissions was due by September 2025, but at this time of writing, only 61 countries (representing 31% of global emissions) have submitted new NDCs, leaving 136 Parties who have yet to do so.

This uneven pace of submissions reflects broader challenges in translating international climate commitments into nationally owned and actionable strategies—a dynamic that is particularly evident in the African context. To better understand these dynamics, Clean Air Task Force (CATF) conducted a comprehensive analysis comparing African countries’ NDCs with their National Development Plans (NDPs). The study assesses how well these two frameworks align—or fail to align—at a moment when countries must confront development realities alongside escalating climate pressures. This policy brief highlights key findings from that analysis and explores their national, regional, and global implications as countries continue to update their NDCs at COP30 and beyond.

Implementing NDCs in Africa

While NDCs have served as important blueprints for national level climate action, they have so far fallen short of bending the emissions curve downwards and positioning countries to better adapt to the impacts of climate change. The recent Global Stocktake— a mandatory periodic evaluation of progress under the Paris Agreement— found that Parties are not on track to meet their long-term goals and called for a significant step-up in ambition.

In many African countries, implementation of NDC targets has been constrained by financial, technological, and institutional capacity limitations that reflect broader development challenges. While climate change remains a global priority, African countries are simultaneously addressing pressing development concerns: access to modern energy services, improving education and health outcomes, ensuring food and water security, and closing infrastructure gaps. Achieving climate goals in this context requires integrating climate ambition with these development imperatives, rather than treating them as separate agenda items.

As countries mark the anniversary of the Paris Agreement and prepare the next round of NDC updates at COP30, this question becomes more urgent: to what extent have African countries managed to align climate ambition with their development priorities— and what must change to prevent further misalignment?

The climate-development policy divergence

The study finds significant divergence between climate and development policy in Africa. NDCs and NDPs are arguably developed for entirely different purposes: NDCs are designed to shape climate action, while NDPs guide national development priorities. However, climate and development issues in Africa are deeply intertwined, with many synergies and trade-offs.

A recently published CATF study reveals that achieving net-zero targets by 2050 comes with economic costs and could result in significant impacts on land, food, and water systems. These potential system-level impacts of energy system transitions in Africa signal the need for climate action to be well-coordinated with other sectoral priorities. This need becomes even more acute when assessed against the continent’s vast development challenges and rapidly shifting demographics. As the fastest growing continent, Africa will account for 25% of the global population by 2050— up from 19% today. This explosive population growth will drive greater demand for energy, food, water, infrastructure, and basic social needs.

Our review of NDCs and NDPs in Africa suggests that governments may not be taking this holistic view of the climate-development nexus into account when designing climate strategies or development plans. Issues which are identified as critical to climate adaptation and mitigation— energy, agriculture, transport, water and forestry— tend to dominate NDCs, while NDPs emphasize themes such as private sector engagement, finance, economy, poverty alleviation. This divergence in policy focus implies that ambitious goals to transform energy systems, as articulated in NDCs, may not be effectively mainstreamed into national economic development planning and investment strategies. This raises serious questions about the feasibility of implementing these strategies, particularly regarding the financing and infrastructural requirements of climate action. Likewise, the economic impacts of climate action may be misunderstood, leading to climate investments that compromise, rather than promote development priorities.

While countries have been encouraged to develop Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategies to situate their NDCs within the broader context of their long-term development plans, this requirement is not mandatory, and very few countries have undertaken this exercise.

The NDC-NDP policy divergence also has major financial implications. The Paris Agreement specifies the need for developed countries to provide the financial support developing countries need to implement climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, but progress has been slow. According to the High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, developing countries (excluding China) will need to mobilize $2.7 trillion annually to meet climate and other nature related goals. $1.3 trillion of this is expected to come from international sources, and $1.4 trillion from domestic sources. The 2024 African Economic Outlook projects even higher climate finance requirements for the African continent alone at $2.7 trillion by 2030. Africa’s climate finance requirements are almost at par with the continental GDP and far exceed its debt levels, which currently stand at $1.8 trillion, with a median debt-to-GDP ratio of 65.5%.

These domestic fiscal challenges, coupled with the failure of multilateral climate diplomacy to raise the needed international finance for climate action, create deep conflicts in resource prioritization for African countries which also face competing development priorities. Misaligned climate and development planning will only deepen this conflict, challenging the feasibility of both climate and development objectives and, in some cases, deepening development constraints.

The sectoral dominance of energy in African climate strategies

Energy is the predominant sector of focus in African NDCs.

This dominant focus on energy is consistent with the global focus on energy sector decarbonization as a key lever for reducing emissions. Climate mitigation accounts for up 66% of total climate finance needs articulated in the NDCs of African countries, with four sectors driving most of this demand: transportation, energy, industry, and agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU). Notably, AFOLU, Africa’s biggest emitting sector, accounted for only 7% of the total mitigation needs articulated in NDCs ($108 million), with the bulk of mitigation finance concentrated in the transportation and energy sectors. Over 94% of transportation finance needs are allocated to South Africa alone, while energy finance is distributed across renewable energy (88%), energy efficiency (10%), and crosscutting initiatives (2%). The relatively low ranking of AFOLU in climate mitigation finance could indicate two possibilities: (1) Africa’s mitigation priorities may be misaligned, or (2) mitigation measures in AFOLU may be cheaper than those in the energy and transport sectors. Regardless of which of these reasons hold, the AFOLU sector warrants deeper investigation, as it is also critically important for adaptation due to its high vulnerability to seasonal climate variability.

Energy, agriculture, and the future of employment in Africa

The AFOLU sector is noteworthy for its dual relevance to energy sector decarbonization and the African economy. The agricultural sector employs roughly 60% of Africa’s total workforce and remains the primary source of employment in some of the continent’s most populous countries.

Energy sector transformation, particularly the shift to renewables, is a key mitigation strategy in African NDCs. However, this transition could potentially come at a cost to the continent’s critical agricultural economy. CATF modeling of net-zero scenarios in Africa finds that achieving net-zero by 2050 in Africa will require a rapid shift to renewables— wind, solar, and hydro— alongside carbon removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While emissions would fall below zero by 2050, this aggressive energy system transformation would place additional pressure on water resources and reduce cropland availability by 31%, driving up staple food prices. The potential land-use impacts of Africa’s energy transition could negatively affect the agricultural sector and associated employment. Yet, our assessment of African NDCs suggests this externality is not fully considered in climate planning. Employment is generally not a priority in NDCs— even in countries where economies are heavily dependent on agriculture for jobs.

Changing course

This analysis reveals that while linkages between climate and development may be recognized in theory, they remain disjointed in practice. This is not entirely surprising— climate discourse has largely evolved separately from economic development discourse. Yet in contexts like Africa, the climate-development linkage cannot be side-stepped. The ability to finance the full scope of climate action will require significant domestic capital, which is scarce in low-income economies. On the other hand, the rapid transformation of energy systems can threaten development imperatives and deepen competition for resources that are central to the structural transformation of African economies. This reality calls for a new approach to climate diplomacy, one which recognizes development as a key determinant of feasible climate action— and vice versa.

Several shifts are needed to change course. At the national level, governments need to better coordinate climate and development planning. NDCs are typically developed under ministries of environment, climate change, energy, or natural resources, while NDPs are typically led by ministries of economic planning and social development, often with little to no input from the environment or natural resources sectors.

Greater coordination across the environment and development ministries would help ensure that the tradeoffs between climate action and development are well understood and integrated into national level strategies.

Both NDCs and NDPs rely on external funding and technical assistance from international sources. In providing external support multilateral and bilateral partners must prioritize local context and the real trade-offs and synergies between climate and development, rather than imposing externally derived frameworks that may not reflect African realities.

Ultimately, global climate diplomacy must better reflect the reality that climate action in Africa is as much about development as it is about reducing emissions. African governments should incorporate this perspective into negotiations on the global stage. National governments and regional institutions like the African Union must invest in building a robust, data-driven understanding of the domestic trade-offs and opportunities of the climate-development complex. These insights can then shape Africa’s bargaining position in global climate diplomacy, promoting formal ambitions assessed not only by emissions reduction potential but also by metrics for energy access, food security, and poverty reduction. Multilateral support negotiations can also shift from non-binding pledges toward demands for deeper structural changes that provide the financial, institutional, and technological conditions necessary to meet both climate and development imperatives.

That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs.
For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.
Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care.
It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill.","Just this month, the state agency that administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program announced the implementation of new restrictions that are expected to take food assistance away from thousands of West Virginians — including older adults between 55-64, veterans, parents of teenagers and former foster youth.

More than 60,000 West Virginians received notices that their health insurance premiums will be skyrocketing on January 1, 2026, given ongoing uncertainty around whether Congress will extend tax subsidies that make ACA Marketplace plans affordable for people who do not receive health coverage through their jobs. And the only hospital in Greenbrier County just announced it will no longer provide labor and delivery services.

What do these concerning developments have in common? They are all part of the fallout from the passage of Congress’ “Big Beautiful Bill” enacted earlier this summer, which all four of West Virginia’s members of Congress voted for.

That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs. It includes the new restrictions that will take food assistance away from parents and veterans in the coming months. For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.

But that’s not all. The bill also slashed Medicaid and SNAP by shifting federal program costs onto state budgets, and lawmakers will now have to come up with tens of millions of state dollars in upcoming years to plug holes in Medicaid and SNAP.

Other components of the legislation impact reimbursements and funding streams for health care providers, which is why some hospitals and clinics across the country are trimming services and even consolidating or closing their doors in anticipation of lower reimbursements and a higher volume of uncompensated care when more patients are uninsured.

While officials at the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center didn’t explicitly blame the federal legislation, they noted the reorganization would give them access to a higher level of reimbursement in order to make the hospital more sustainable. Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care. Now families in Greenbrier County and surrounding towns will have to travel farther for treatment and staff may lose their jobs or be forced to transfer farther away for work.

What the legislation shockingly did not contain, despite the prioritization of windfall tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy (80% of the tax benefits go to the top 10% richest households), was an extension of the tax credits that help hardworking West Virginians — mainly self-employed, small business owners and their employees, and retirees — afford health coverage on the marketplace. That explains the sticker shock many are experiencing now while shopping for health coverage for January.

These are all the very real results of the Big Beautiful Bill, despite assertions from the legislation’s supporters that the impacts are delayed or that band-aid provisions like the Rural Health Transformation Program will dampen the harms.

While some of the effects are already here, there is much more pain to come in the form of deep cuts to Medicaid both via eligibility restrictions and more federal cost shifts onto states, higher costs for West Virginians with student loan debt, and higher energy prices due to the repeal of affordable, clean energy programs. These changes don’t only hurt the West Virginians who directly utilize these programs, but also the rest of us when our community hospitals reduce services, job losses in the health care and energy industries weaken our economy, and more of our community members experience hunger and suffering.

It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill. They can still roll back these harmful changes — but they must acknowledge that the harm is here. For many of us, it’s already undeniable.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:14.032026

""It all boils down to people,"" Steve McKinney, vice president for U.S. Commercial Operations at Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company, said.","State and federal lawmakers, nuclear energy experts and industry professionals from around the globe met last week at the Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit at Purdue University to discuss the future of nuclear energy in Indiana.

Rising energy demands from data centers loomed over the conversation. And while modern nuclear energy technology can be pricey, difficult to bring to fruition, and probably years away from reality, the resounding sentiment at the two-day summit Nov. 5-6 was enthusiasm for the industry’s future.

Indiana, with strong support from the state government, universities and utility partners, is a prime place for the nuclear industry to grow, said Brendon Baatz, who works in energy market development at Google.

The push for modern nuclear technology in the form of small module reactors known as SMRs comes alongside a steep rise in demand for energy. Indiana's energy grid is strained and Hoosiers face high energy bills.

Nuclear energy, which aligns with the state's desire for an ""all of the above"" approach to energy, probably won't solve those issues now — there are no nuclear plants ready to start creating energy in Indiana today — but the technology might help mitigate rising demand from future data centers.

A flurry of announcements about Indiana's nuclear future were made at the summit; here are four takeaways:

First American Nuclear moves to Indiana

First American Nuclear (FANCO), a nuclear energy startup, announced plans to move the company headquarters, manufacturing facilities and an energy park to Indiana. But company officials did not provide details, like where in the state the company planned to put its footprint.

FANCO plans to introduce the state's first nuclear energy to the grid by 2032, according to Bloomberg.

“Indiana is leading the nation in the next chapter of American energy independence,” Gov. Mike Braun wrote in a news release from the company. “With First American Nuclear planting its roots here, we’re bringing 5,000 high-paying, generational Hoosier jobs while cementing our state as a leader in clean, reliable nuclear power.”

At the summit, a FANCO representative said the company's nuclear reactor, called EAGL-1, will add 240 megawatts to the grid. In the meantime, FANCO plans to build a natural gas plant to bring energy online in the nearer-term future but provided no details on where either facility will be located.

AES launches study to determine if SMR’s are viable

Brandi Davis-Handy, the president of AES Indiana, announced the utility's plans to study the technical feasibility of incorporating SMRs at their Eagle Valley and Petersburg sites.

The goal, Davis-Handy said, is to analyze the possibility of building nuclear reactors onsite. The company is analyzing the availability of cooling water along with emergency planning considerations and transmission infrastructure capacity.

However, AES's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, which guides the utility's long-term resource planning and which was filed this month, struck a different note on nuclear energy.

The report said that the company will not pursue small module reactors in the near term despite international and national efforts to advance the technology because nuclear technology is both new and incredibly costly to deploy.

""The ink isn't even dry on AES Indiana's IRP, which found SMRs are not cost effective under any scenario, and the utility is announcing it is doing a study on siting SMRs at its power plants!?"" Ben Inskeep, director of the consumer advocacy organization Citizen’s Action Coalition, wrote on X.

AES currently doesn't have nuclear in its portfolio, but Davis-Handy said she anticipates the Eagle Valley and Petersburg study will be completed by the middle of 2026 to provide a ""clear road map for future progress.""

The industry needs more workers

One resounding message from the summit: if nuclear is to thrive in the United States, more people must join its workforce.

""It all boils down to people,"" Steve McKinney, vice president for U.S. Commercial Operations at Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company, said. ""People design, build, operate and maintain nuclear power plants.""

In tandem with the industry's calls for bolstering the workforce, Purdue University announced a new arm of its engineering department at the summit on Wednesday, Nov. 5.

The Institute for Energy Innovation will ""spark and nurture innovations within Purdue University to create scalable technologies for the energy transition"" and train students interested in energy technology, according to a statement from the university.

McKinney emphasized that nuclear companies are connecting with union trades and tech schools to help rebuild the workforce.

""We also need pipe fitters and welders and electricians,"" he said. ""Believe it not, it's harder to find an electrician today than it is to find an electrical engineer.""

Nuclear isn't a quick-fix

Throughout the conference's panels, anonymous questions peppered the screen above panelists' heads. Some of these expressed concern over the high cost of electricity that Hoosiers are experiencing right now.

Energy experts often link soaring electric bills to a rising demand for energy, without a concurrent spike in supply. But nuclear energy isn't ready to fill the gap; at the summit, panelists and speakers theorized that reactors would be unlikely to start providing energy before at least 2030.

Skeptics of nuclear energy think the technology is unproven and they raise concerns that the high cost of building a nuclear plant will ultimately fall on consumers. Historically, nuclear projects tend to finish well over budget, and sometimes, not at all.

Even industry experts conceded that at the beginning of a plant's life, nuclear is costly.

""It may not be the least cost plant to bring online at the time it is constructed, over the life the plant it provides a lot of value for the community, a lot of value for the customer, and with the current policies and the Inflation Reduction Act, it becomes very attractive,"" Chris Nolan, the vice president of new nuclear generation strategy and regulatory engagement of Duke Energy, said.

Controlling phosphorus in Lake Champlain is one of the hardest and most important pollution problems in the region, according to a panel of experts hosted by Adirondack Explorer.

During a 90-minute discussion at SUNY Plattsburgh on Thursday night, the panel of scientists and advocates working in both Vermont and New York agreed that much work remains to rein in the amount of phosphorus making its way into the lake and grapple with a long legacy of farming, logging and other impacts to the region’s environment.

The types of projects needed to mitigate phosphorus loading in Lake Champlain, which drives harmful algal bloom growth, vary widely from specific agricultural practices to minimizing erosion by seeding roadside ditches.

Even simple mitigation projects are complex and costly. But the panelists agreed that in a region dependent on its abundant water resources, the cost of failing to address the projects is much greater.

“The cost of that inaction is much more substantial than the cost of the actions we need to take,” said Brendan Wiltse, executive director of the Lake George Association. “If we don’t protect clean water, the cost of turning the dial back will be much more.”

Phosphorus control is hard

With a vast watershed, legacy of agriculture and worsening storms, Lake Champlain and its advocates face a massive challenge in addressing phosphorus pollution to the lake. It touches every corner of the watershed and impacts all of its residents.

The sources of phosphorus range from runoff from dairy farms in northern Vermont to roadside erosion in Washington County. Overlapping government oversight and limited resources add to the challenge. And the growing impacts of climate change have scarcely been accounted for in the data and models that say the region continues to fall short of its phosphorus control target.

By comparison, the challenge of phosphorus control makes road salt reduction look easy.

On farms, the challenge can boil down to something as practical as whether an operation has the capacity — and weather — to harvest feed crops and plant cover crops before it’s too late. Farmers are often struggling to make it to the next day, let alone revamp their entire operation with up-to-date phosphorus control strategies.

“If you are struggling to put food on your table, that’s not exactly when you are going to decide to change how you live your life,” said Laura Klaiber, a research scientist with the Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy. “It may not even have anything to do with opinion but what do I feel I can actually do and make it to the end of the day.”

Wiltse said the total amount of phosphorus in Lake George has remained relatively stable but that the form of phosphorus that can more easily be used by plankton and cyanobacteria in the lake is growing as a share.

“When we look at the issues facing Lake George, one of the top threats we have identified is nutrient pollution, specifically phosphorus,” Wiltse said. “The fact that the most available form of phosphorus is increasing in the lake is a real concern for us.”

Even where communities have identified mitigation projects they are often beyond their funding resources and involve substantial engineering and planning, which are also costly.

“Getting funding to implement changes, that’s always a problem,” said Sue Hagar, watershed coordinator of the Champlain Watershed Improvement Coalition of New York.

Phosphorus reduction projects do much more

A benefit of phosphorus control projects is that they often help address other challenges.

Many restoration projects that reduce flood risk, improve fish habitat and improve overall stream health also limit phosphorus runoff. Some projects might qualify for phosphorus funding, while offering other benefits.

The Lake George Association is working in communities around Lake George to incentivize better practices in how stormwater is managed in development projects, supporting towns to include those practices in local ordinances and in some cases offer tax credits to projects that utilize them. LGA is also working directly with developers to encourage the practices and make them aware of benefits.

Massive investments in wastewater treatment on Lake Champlain have pay dividends, and the wastewater sector is one of the few sources of phosphorus consistently meeting its targets.

But there is still much work to do under existing laws, the panelists said.

“We have to make sure that people are completely implementing all the laws that are out there,” said Julie Silverman, the Lake Champlain Lakekeeper. “We know there are a lot of things phasing in but we have to really get at it, we have to hold our legislators and leadership accountable. It’s not that they aren’t doing the work, we just have lots of stuff that needs to happen.”

Vermont ag oversight is a work in progress

When Vermont officials updated their phosphorus targets in 2016, they estimated that 69% of the phosphorus in Lake Champlain was coming from Vermont and 41% of Vermont’s phosphorus was coming from farm runoff.

Silverman and panelists Jenny Patterson, executive director of the Lake Champlain Committee, both represent organizations that in 2022 petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency, arguing Vermont state agencies were failing at protecting the lake from farm runoff.

After the EPA agreed with that claim, Vermont state lawmakers earlier this year adopted a new law requiring the state develop a permit for large concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Surely, those are already permitted, said Klaiber, who works in New York.

RELATED READING: Targeting the cause of Champlain’s algal blooms

“That is the problem in Vermont: the permits haven’t been issued,” Patterson said.

The state established a stakeholder process that will soon kick off the development of that CAFOs permit, and the requirements that large dairy farms will be held to going forward.

The law establishes that the current standards for CAFOs under federal law will remain Vermont’s standards even if they are changed at the federal level.

“One of the things that’s been challenging about the whole discussion in Vermont is the need for certainty, and the farmers need to understand what the standards are,” Patterson said.

Silverman said that EPA officials have remained engaged on the issue through the change in administration.

“They are still at the table,” Silverman said.

Klaiber said that in New York, where the state does administer a CAFOs permit, farms are obligated to adopt certain practices. She added that farmers would benefit from more technical assistance and funding support to expand the use of those best practices. Though, many of the agencies that provide that technical expertise, like cooperative extensions, have seen their funding cut in recent years.

“Do those extension agents have enough support for their continuing education to learn and grow as the technologies and principles are changing and growing, so that they can then take that information to the farmer,” Klaiber said. “Trying to get that information to farmers is a bit of a shortcoming.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Champlain-algae-2-scaled.jpg?fit=2048%2C1310&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-10 08:02:12.417422

Now, nuclear power is emerging as an unlikely solution.

One of the firsts to take the leap, Google and NextEra Energy Resources have announced plans to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Centre in Iowa – marking one of the industry’s most significant moves yet to address this power crunch.

The benefits of the Duane Arnold Energy Centre in Iowa

The 615-megawatt nuclear facility near Cedar Rapids shut down in 2020 but will return to service in the first quarter of 2029 under a 25-year power purchase agreement.

NextEra Energy Resources, a major US power generation company, is acquiring full ownership of the facility and will coordinate its restart.

Google purchases the majority of Duane Arnold’s output, while Central Iowa Power Cooperative buys the remaining portion under identical terms.

The arrangement gets at the heart of a problem that’s putting pressure on energy executives: AI infrastructure needs continuous power that wind and solar cannot provide on their own.

Data centres housing the servers that train AI models operate around the clock, creating relentless demand for baseload power sources that generate electricity regardless of weather conditions.

“AI is forcing an honest conversation about clean energy,” says Robert Little, gTech Sustainability Strategy Lead at Google.

“AI and cloud infrastructure need massive, reliable, clean power. Not just when the sun shines or the wind blows, but 24/7.”

Why NextEra acquires full ownership as Google shoulders financial responsibility

NextEra Energy is acquiring the combined 30% stake held by Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative, bringing its ownership to 100%.

The power purchase agreement enables the investment required to restart operations, with Google bearing the financial responsibility for its portion.

As a result, Iowa electricity customers won’t bear costs associated with Google’s purchases from the facility, according to NextEra Energy.

The economics paint an appealing picture for Iowa. An economic study projects the restart generates more than US$9bn in economic benefits to the state, with construction creating over 1,600 jobs.

Once operational, 400 direct full-time positions will be established, primarily in Linn County.

Conclusion Promoting renewable energy access in rural communities is a critical step toward achieving sustainable development, reducing poverty, and combating climate change.","Introduction

Access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy is essential for economic growth, education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. However, over 700 million people globally—mostly in rural and remote areas—still lack access to electricity. Many rely on traditional biomass and fossil fuels, which are inefficient, costly, and harmful to human health and the environment.

Renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, biogas, and mini-hydro systems offer viable, clean, and sustainable alternatives for rural electrification. This proposal outlines an initiative to promote renewable energy access in rural communities through technology deployment, capacity building, and policy advocacy.

Problem Statement

Rural communities in many developing countries face persistent energy poverty, which hampers social and economic development. Key challenges include:

Lack of infrastructure for electricity generation and distribution.

High cost of connection to national grids.

Limited technical knowledge about renewable energy technologies.

Dependence on firewood and diesel generators, leading to environmental degradation.

Without targeted interventions, these communities will remain trapped in a cycle of poverty, energy insecurity, and environmental harm.

Project Objectives

The main goal of this project is to enhance access to affordable and sustainable renewable energy solutions in rural areas.

Specific objectives include:

Install renewable energy systems (e.g., solar mini-grids, biogas plants) in targeted communities.

Build technical and entrepreneurial capacity among local residents for energy management and maintenance.

Promote awareness of the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy.

Encourage policy support and partnerships for rural energy expansion.

Proposed Activities

We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM.

Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history.

More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.

All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads.

A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.

Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it.

I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?

Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission.

Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage.

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.

According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)

The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.

Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.”

The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant.

You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get.

Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states.

Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid.

But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?

I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.

But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25% — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.

This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into.

Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.

An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption.

Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.

The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.

Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments.

The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail.

Not a zero-sum choice The path forward does not have to be a zero-sum choice between gas and renewables.
In North Africa, that means gas remains part of the equation even as solar and wind surge.
As Ali Saffar notes, “North Africa already has a pretty well-developed natural gas power generating capacity, and that can play an integral role in integrating an additional share of renewables.
Its Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, still the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant, symbolises this push, capable of powering over a million homes.","In just two decades, the Middle East and North Africa’s electricity consumption has tripled, rising by more than 1,000 terawatt-hours —a surge that places it behind only China and India as a driver of global power demand.

Driven by extreme heat and water scarcity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that power demand across the region will rise by 50% by 2035 in order to meet liveable conditions, the equivalent of adding Germany and Spain’s combined electricity use. Meeting that demand under current trends would mean burning roughly 2.8 million barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic metres of gas each year.

In its latest report on the future of electricity in the Middle East and North Africa, the IEA warns that this rise in demand could deepen the region’s dependence on gas-fired power; particularly in North Africa, where natural gas and oil already provide around 90% of electricity generation.

“This projection is alarming for North Africa as it highlights both economic and energy security risks,” says Abdelaziz Khlaifat, chair of the petroleum and energy engineering department at the American University in Cairo (AUC).

“Higher gas use could divert export revenues and trap countries like Egypt, Algeria, and Libya in a costly, carbon-intensive path just as global markets shift toward renewables. It would strain budgets, prolong subsidies, and limit funds for development – the region risks exchanging short-term stability for long-term vulnerability.”

Yet the IEA report also underscores the scale of opportunity for North Africa to reshape its energy systems. The region already attracts some of the fastest-growing clean-energy investment in the developing world – over $44bn in 2024, projected to rise by nearly 50% by 2035- and boasts some of the world’s highest solar irradiation levels.

Not a zero-sum choice

The path forward does not have to be a zero-sum choice between gas and renewables. That is what Ali Saffar, head of division for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America at the IEA tells African Business.

“Gas will absolutely have a role to play in the electricity network,” he says. “Even in our most central scenarios, we see gas playing a big role alongside a large increase in solar, which will grow from about 5-6% of the mix today to roughly a quarter.”

Diversification, rather than replacement, is the real goal. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 stresses that a secure and sustainable transition in emerging economies will depend on using all available assets efficiently – including existing fossil-fuel infrastructure – while scaling up renewables and improving grids. In North Africa, that means gas remains part of the equation even as solar and wind surge.

The region’s well-developed gas networks can help stabilise power systems and balance variable renewables, providing a bridge toward deeper decarbonisation instead of an obstacle to it.

As Ali Saffar notes, “North Africa already has a pretty well-developed natural gas power generating capacity, and that can play an integral role in integrating an additional share of renewables. Between grid investments and existing capacity, countries can scale up variable renewables quite comfortably.”

That flexibility will be increasingly critical as climate pressures reshape the region’s energy needs. Rising temperatures and worsening water scarcity are driving up electricity demand not only for cooling homes and cities but also for desalinating seawater —two essential but energy-hungry processes that often rely on gas. Across the MENA region, cooling already accounts for up to 70% of peak electricity demand in the summer, while desalination consumes around 5% of total electricity output, a share expected to double by 2040 as freshwater demand grows.

As countries move away from thermal desalination, which burns fossil fuels, toward reverse osmosis, the process has become far more efficient and better suited to renewable integration.

“From an energy perspective, reverse osmosis is roughly ten times more efficient than thermal desalination,” says Saffar.

“You only need electricity, and that electricity can be renewable. Since 2018, no new thermal plants have been added; all new capacity is electricity-fed, which fits naturally with the region’s growing solar generation.”

Jauad El Kharraz, chief executive director of the Water Energy Climate Experts Network(WECEN) in Morocco, notes that his country’s mandate to power new desalination plants with renewables is “a critical test case”.

Its plan to produce 1.7 billion cubic metres of desalinated water annually by 2030, while ensuring that new plants are powered by renewables, reflects the kind of integrated water-energy plan approach needed to avoid locking economies into high-cost, high-carbon paths.

“Initiatives like TERAMED, aiming for 1 TW of Mediterranean renewables by 2030, are therefore essential to break this cycle and secure a sustainable future.”

Diverging paths

Every country in North Africa has its own particularities and challenges. Since launching its 2009 National Energy Strategy, Morocco has pursued one of the most ambitious clean-energy transitions in the Global South. It aims for 52% renewable installed capacity by 2030 – equivalent to roughly 40–45% of total electricity generation – and already reached about 38% of installed capacity in 2023, El Kharraz points out. That puts Morocco on par with countries like France (22.3%) and ahead of Japan (25.7%) in renewable share of electricity.

Its Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, still the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant, symbolises this push, capable of powering over a million homes. Wind capacity stood at 2.37 GW by end-2024, with another 2.6 GW under development, while solar potential remains enormous: irradiation levels reach 2,200 kWh/m²/year, among the highest globally.

“Morocco’s renewables push offers key lessons for neighbours like Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt,” says El Kharraz.

“Strong political commitment and clear targets – like reaching 52% renewables by 2030 – drive progress. Strategic investments in flagship projects such as Noor attract funding, while policy frameworks like public-private partnerships enable scaling. Regional cooperation too, exemplified by TERAMED’s civil society-led 1 TW Mediterranean goal, can amplify ambition through shared financing and knowledge exchange.”

This exchange is crucial in a region where energy systems evolve at uneven speeds. Algeria remains bound to hydrocarbons, with renewables supplying barely 1% of its electricity despite ambitious plans for 22 GW of capacity by 2030 and vast untapped solar potential like the rest of peers. Tunisia, though committed to reaching 30% renewables by 2030, continues to wrestle with regulatory and financing constraints, leaving it reliant on gas and imports: roughly 11% of its power still comes from Algeria.

Egypt sits somewhere in between; more ambitious than Tunisia, less advanced than Morocco, but central to the region’s energy future.

“Egypt’s renewable sector shows promise but uneven progress,” says Abdelaziz Khlaifat from Cairo.

“Projects like the Benban Solar Park, one of the world’s largest with 1.8 GW capacity, showcase Egypt’s solar potential, while the El-Dabaa nuclear plant marks a broader diversification effort. The country also benefits from strong wind resources along the Gulf of Suez and growing grid interconnections, positioning it as a potential power-trade hub. Yet, financing gaps, grid limits, and regulatory hurdles slow momentum.

“Sustained progress will depend on policy stability, infrastructure upgrades, and private investment to speed up the energy transition.”

Resources and tech can meet demand

The International Energy Agency’s report is a wake up call, but one that should be met with enthusiasm rather than fear. While North Africa is going to experience one of the fastest surges of electricity demand in the next decade, it has the resources and technology to not just meet that demand, but also to exceed it if greater diversification, cuts to grid losses and regulatory harmonisation are put in place.

According to the IEA, the MENA region’s role “will have profound implications for global energy markets” as it shifts from being only a producer of oil and gas to a centre of electricity generation and trade. The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) describes partnerships between the European Union and North Africa as a “win-win formula for energy security, investment and development.”

From Tangiers, Jauad El Kharraz notes that under AfCFTA, there is also space for regional cooperation: “Morocco can export to West Africa via interconnections with Mauritania and beyond, fostering south-south ties.”

But before North Africa looks outward, it must look inward. The IEA’s Ali Saffar cautions against seeing the region purely through an export lens.

“It is premature to be talking about massive electricity exports in countries that have not really industrialised or where social pressures are so strong. Bringing stable, affordable electricity domestically is probably priority number one.”

North Africa’s demographic realities make this especially urgent. The region is home to one of the youngest populations in the world, with youth unemployment rates exceeding 22% according to the ILO. Reliable and affordable power is not only essential for homes and services, but also for attracting industry, creating jobs and anchoring low-carbon manufacturing. As Saffar notes, “simple commodity trading is not going to create the jobs nor the value nor the revenues to take care of some of these crucial issues: what matters is domestic value creation.”

His point resonates across the region, where export ambitions sometimes eclipse local needs. In Egypt, for instance, liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports have expanded even as the country faced rolling two to three-hour power cuts in 2024 due to fuel shortages and heat-driven demand surges.

Avoiding this trap will require pairing the energy transition with industrial policy, while ensuring that local firms, not just foreign investors, share in the gains. “Priority number two,” Saffar adds, “is seeing whether you can go up the value chain in developing a low-carbon industry on the back of your renewables endowment.”

If managed wisely, this dual approach —meeting local demand first and then scaling through regional and international trade – could make North Africa not only a bridge of clean power between continents but also a laboratory for inclusive industrial growth within Africa. The question now is not whether the region can produce enough clean energy, but whether it can harness that power to light up its own future before exporting it abroad.",https://african.business/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/000_692m8ax-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:31.151729

The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.

This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.

During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a ""hoax.""

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.

Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.

If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.

""Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,"" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.

Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.

Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component focuses on reversing the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many federal climate policies such as improving vehicle mileage and cutting power plant pollution.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that endangerment finding, making it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.

The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.

Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies

The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.

The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.

The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.

Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide

The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.

Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.

Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.

Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data

The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.

The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.

He vowed to bring down the cost of groceries (an “old-fashioned” word with which he was obsessed), revive manufacturing, slash federal spending and inefficiency and distribute the savings to the citizenry, all while achieving energy dominance and the high-paying jobs that come with it.

By early summer, however, it was becoming clear that Trump’s economic policies were not having the promised effect.

Trump’s tariffs only exacerbated the post-COVID inflation that had haunted Joe Biden’s presidency. Prices rose on everything from steel pipe to coffee, while retaliatory trade barriers hurt U.S. manufacturers. The loss of Biden-era grants and loans caused several firms to cancel planned billion-dollar manufacturing facilities, and tourism fell as international travelers began to avoid the U.S. The mass firing of federal employees has further eroded the already-lagging jobs situation, while the mass deportation and harassment of immigrants has sent painful ripples through the West’s construction, agriculture, leisure and hospitality industries.

Across the Southwest, the economic cracks are widening.

Tourism

The administration’s “America First” creed — which often manifests as hostility toward anyone who is not the “right kind” of American — has begun to hollow out the nation’s essential immigrant labor force, hitting the agriculture, construction and service industries especially hard. It’s also discouraged travel from abroad, especially in the Southwest, walloping that region’s tourism sector.

The World Travel & Tourism Council predicted that the U.S. will lose about $12.5 billion in international spending this year, prompting Council President Julia Simpson to warn:

This is a wake-up call for the U.S. government. While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the ‘closed’ sign.

Following a string of record-breaking years for national parks, the number of visitors enjoying America’s “best idea” has dried up this summer, impacting gateway communities, especially in the Southwest, despite relatively low gas prices.

▼ 3.8% Amount that international air travel into the U.S. for January through July declined from the previous year.

▼ 15% Number of Canadian air passengers arriving in the U.S. this August compared to last year.

Trade War Fallout

Trump’s tariffs were supposed to help American businesses by raising costs on imported goods. But the haphazard way in which they’ve been implemented has spawned uncertainty and increased the cost of steel, aluminum, fertilizer and other inputs for American producers, in many cases hurting rather than helping them. Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs have seriously dampened hay and meat exports from Western states, especially those going to China.

In September, there were 8% fewer drilling rigs operating in Western states than there were a year earlier, an indication of a struggling industry.

“The Liberation Day chaos and tariff antics have harmed the domestic energy industry. Drill, baby, drill will not happen with this level of volatility. Companies will continue to lay down rigs and frack spreads.”

Since we have no control over those ozone levels, the EPA is willing to exclude days with high ozone caused by wildfires from the official readings.
Even though ozone levels were relatively low in 2025, official ozone levels could be even lower by eliminating wildfire days, which would reduce the average of ozone levels for 2024, 2025 and 2026.
Has Polis directed the agencies to keep official ozone levels high so that he can use the ozone for additional attacks if he so chooses?
Why has Polis allowed the agencies to continue making up “stories” about what is causing high ozone rather than finding out where the ozone is really coming from — unless he wants ozone readings to remain high?","Our state’s air-quality agencies have posted our ozone results for 2025, and once again, the official ozone levels for Front Range Colorado exceed allowable federal levels.

But this time there is a difference. It turns out wildfires are responsible for some of our highest ozone days. Federal regulators will allow Colorado to exclude those readings from our official ozone levels — if our state agencies request it. Here’s the first question: Why haven’t those agencies already done so?

If the agencies don’t act, there is no possible way we will achieve the national ozone standard when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviews our ozone levels in 2027.

This is a big deal. Everyone should be concerned about Colorado achieving the ozone standard, because if we don’t, we will be reclassified from our current “severe” non-attainment to “extreme” non-attainment — and the EPA will require the state to implement new transportation congestion controls.

And that just may be Gov. Jared Polis’s goal. Are you ready to let legislators tell you when you’re allowed to drive your own car?

Taking action

In 2027, the EPA will use the three-year average of the ozone levels from 2024, 2025, and 2026 to determine whether we met the ozone standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb).

Several days in 2024 had very high ozone levels due to wildfires, and even though levels were relatively low in 2025, some of the highest ozone days were again caused by wildfires. Since we have no control over those ozone levels, the EPA is willing to exclude days with high ozone caused by wildfires from the official readings.

But if we want the EPA to consider excluding days with high ozone due to wildfires, our state agencies have to present evidence of the wildfire influence to the EPA for every day claimed to be a wildfire day. Our agencies haven’t done that.

As a result, with wildfire days included for 2024 and 2025, the only way we can achieve the standard is if the official ozone levels next year are much lower than they have ever been for the last 30 ozone seasons, and there is no chance that will happen.

This is no small matter. There were 19 obvious wildfire days in 2024. If all 19 days were eliminated, the highest ozone reading would be 73 ppb instead of 88 ppb — and we would meet the 75 ppb standard for 2024. It does not matter if there might have been high ozone on those days even without wildfires. That’s not the way it works.

To have the best chance of meeting the standard, we need the agencies to exclude the wildfire days from 2025 as well. Even though ozone levels were relatively low in 2025, official ozone levels could be even lower by eliminating wildfire days, which would reduce the average of ozone levels for 2024, 2025 and 2026.

For example, on May 10 this year, every monitor in the Front Range non-attainment area except Chatfield and Highland had one of the highest ozone days of the year even though temperatures were fairly cool, in the low to mid 70’s. Consider the odds that monitors as far apart as Black Hawk, Boulder Reservoir, and Aurora Reservoir would all have elevated ozone levels on the same day, and they all had exactly the same ozone level. This was a wildfire day.

On June 19, every monitor from Ft. Collins down to Loveland and Greeley had one of the highest ozone days of the year. In addition, ozone hit 90 ppb at Greeley, and ozone never hits 90 ppb at Greeley. By way of contrast, there wasn’t even one monitor south of Berthoud where the ozone level exceeded 70 ppb. This was a wildfire day for the northern monitors.

Unfortunately, the agencies have a new computer program that tells them that wildfires had no influence on ozone readings on these two days, because monitors did not detect ground-level smoke. The agencies should know that there does not need to be ground-level smoke for wildfires to influence ozone levels. The gaseous emissions from wildfires can reach ground level through vertical mixing even if the actual smoke is a thousand feet up.

It is disappointing that the agencies are now basing wildfire determinations exclusively on a program that obviously does not work rather than using science, but that may be the point.

The question here is whether the agencies are just incompetent, or Polis has directed them to keep the official ozone levels high by using whatever means are available, including citing faulty computer programs.

If you don’t want legislators telling you when you are allowed to drive your own car, now is the time to contact the Polis administration and urge them to direct the agencies to exclude all of the wildfire days for 2024 and 2025.

Everyone should take another look at the Employee Traffic Reduction Program (ETRP) proposed in 2021. The program would have forced larger companies to prohibit 40% of their employees from driving themselves to work alone. Is this what we want from our government?

Legislators actually bragged that the ETRP program would disrupt the commute for hundreds of thousands of employees at larger companies, and they claimed it was justified because we had high ozone levels. They were far less vocal about the fact that the program would reduce emissions that cause ozone by less than one-half of 1%, and the program would have no measurable effect on reducing ozone.

If the air-quality agencies don’t act, it is possible that legislators may try to introduce the ETRP program again.

The ozone pretext

Consider this. As long as we have high ozone, the governor can use those readings to “justify” any project he wants. For example, since we have high ozone, he claims we need to spend more than $3 billion for Front Range rail to reduce ozone, even though the state’s own website shows that, in the best-case scenario, they will have only 6,900 riders per day during the week. That’s compared to over 400,000 individual motor-vehicle trips on I-25 every day. At best, Front Range rail will reduce highway vehicle trips by less than 2%, and that will have no measurable effect on reducing ozone.

Polis has made it clear that he is personally interested in Front Range rail. Has he directed the agencies to make absolutely certain that we are reclassified as “extreme” non-attainment so that Front Range rail can be included as one component of the required transportation congestion controls? Is that why the agencies are doing nothing to exclude wildfire days?

Polis has also weaponized ozone. In 2023, he “declared” that emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from oil and gas facilities were causing “almost half” of the ozone in the Denver metro area, and he issued executive orders that oil and gas had to reduce NOx emissions.

To justify his attack on oil and gas, Polis referenced a page in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for reducing ozone, which was written by the state’s air-quality agencies. The SIP shows that oil and gas facilities emit almost half of the NOx produced in the non-attainment area, but the facilities are spread out over more than 1,500 square miles. Realistically, the vast majority of the facilities are so far away that their emissions have no chance of moving into the Denver metro area.

In fact, if Polis had bothered to read the next chapter of that same SIP, he would have seen that the agencies included an analysis that showed that oil and gas accounts for only 3.4% of the ozone in the Denver area, which is a long way from “almost half.”

It is not clear why Polis would make a declaration that was so obviously false. He even cited the very document that showed he was wrong. Why didn’t the air-quality agencies that wrote the SIP correct him? Are they so incompetent that they did not understand what was in the SIP they wrote? Were they scared of contradicting the boss? Or did they mention it to Polis, and he told them to keep it quiet?

Has Polis directed the agencies to keep official ozone levels high so that he can use the ozone for additional attacks if he so chooses?

The directors of the two air-quality agencies are not engineers. In fact, it is not clear whether there is even one air-quality engineer on staff who has actual field experience locating and controlling air pollution sources.

If Polis actually wanted to reduce ozone, he could have decided that the agencies should be run by air-quality engineers who had actual field experience, or he could have required the agencies to hire experienced air-quality engineers to get the job done. He didn’t, and they didn’t. So, we still have high ozone, and that may be the goal.

Scapegoating oil & gas

Since the agencies do not have experienced field engineers on staff, they have issued “stories” that they expect the public to believe instead of establishing and presenting scientific facts to show how to reduce ozone. The longest running story has been that oil and gas facilities are a major cause of ozone, but the agencies have overwhelming proof that they are not.

The agencies have monitors at Greeley and LaSalle that are surrounded by thousands of oil and gas facilities, but those two monitors have some of the lowest ozone levels in the non-attainment area. That’s because emissions from oil and gas are not causing high ozone.

The monitor at LaSalle was moved from Platteville, which is more or less at the center of oil and gas production. Before being moved, the monitor included wind direction. Overnight, NOx levels at Platteville were generally in single digits, but occasionally exceeded 10 ppb. On almost every afternoon during ozone season, regardless of which way the wind was blowing, NOx levels at Platteville dropped to zero. Even with thousands of oil and gas facilities within a few miles in every direction, there was no NOx at Platteville in the afternoon, when ozone forms.

In spite of Polis’s “declaration,” NOx from oil and gas is not causing high ozone in Denver, because there isn’t any. The monitor at Platteville proved that all of the NOx from oil and gas reacts very quickly and has no chance of reaching Denver.

The NOx from oil and gas was not causing high ozone at Platteville, either. Platteville also had some of the lowest ozone levels in the area.

Instead, the highest NOx levels in the metro area by far are recorded at the Welby monitor, just south of Thornton. The NOx levels rarely exceed 5 ppb when the wind is from the northeast, from the direction of oil and gas. However, overnight, when the wind is from the southwest, Welby has the highest NOx levels in the area, even from 10 pm to 6 am.

The high NOx at Welby is not a secret. The monitor was turned on March 23, 2008. The very next day, with the wind from the southwest, the NOx level hit 230 ppb. Compare that to 10 ppb at Platteville.

The Welby monitor has recorded the highest NOx levels in the non-attainment area since 2008, but the agencies don’t even acknowledge it. The NOx that causes the high ozone levels is coming from the Denver area, not from oil and gas, but the agencies don’t seem to care.

Why has Polis allowed the agencies to continue making up “stories” about what is causing high ozone rather than finding out where the ozone is really coming from — unless he wants ozone readings to remain high?

If there is any consideration about actually reducing ozone in the Denver area, the agencies need to determine what is causing the high NOx levels at Welby. Right now, however, we have a more urgent concern.

If we don’t want legislators telling us when we are allowed to drive our cars, or imposing other draconian restrictions, we need the state’s air-quality agencies to do their jobs and exclude the wildfire days for 2024 and 2025 from our official ozone levels. If they refuse to do it, they should at least own up to it — and explain why.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_SundayNov9PerspectiveMug-Barney-Strobel.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:21:30.017423

Two Irish projects, HERO and BUSUnited, have been granted almost €3.5m in funding by the European Commission (EC) to address issues in the country’s clean-energy transition and accelerate innovation.

The funding will be released under the 2024 EU Life Programme, which is an initiative that supports environmental and climate action throughout the 27 EU member states. This is achieved by supporting important projects aimed at improving biodiversity, sustainable living and the clean-energy sector.

The financial support allocated towards Ireland will focus primarily on expanding home energy renovation services and tackling skills shortages in the construction sector. Ireland is currently not on course to meet its target of 500,000 home energy retrofits by 2030.

The HERO project (Holistic Energy Retrofit Empowerment for One-Stop Shops) will receive just under €1.5m from the EC, with the aim of developing a stronger national model for One-Stop Shops and improving access to finance for smaller contractors. The purpose is to remove bottlenecks and double the current rate of residential deep renovations.

The BUSUnited (Building up pan-European skills in the building sector) project targets the shortage of skilled workers in Ireland’s construction and retrofit industry. Awarded just under €2m by the EC, BUSUnited will bring together more than 400 stakeholders from public bodies, training organisations, industry and civil society to upscale and reskill the workforce needed to deliver energy-efficient buildings in Ireland and across Europe.

The Life Programme is the EU’s funding instrument for the environment, climate action and clean-energy sectors. For the 2021–2027 period there is a budget of approximately €5.4bn, with projects typically receiving between €1m and €5m in co-financing. Higher amounts are available for larger integrated projects.

A number of organisations in Ireland have made commitments to the region’s clean-energy targets by expanding their capabilities, acquiring or partnering with other businesses in this space.

Full Stack Energy, a Limerick-headquartered energy technology company, recently announced plans to expand into the US market with a partnership with Massachusetts-based energy market consultancy Skipping Stone. The team-up will enable both companies to combine their expertise in the energy sector and face complex challenges around decarbonisation, renewables integration and distributed energy management.

Also, Aviva Investors, the global asset management business of Aviva plc, announced a partnership with Irish energy infrastructure specialist Astatine, with plans for the two organisations to work together to create an energy transition platform to fund and deliver renewable energy projects in Ireland and across wider Europe.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Clean-Energy.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:45.689052

This venture takes aim at two longstanding, elusive cleantech dreams: reinventing pumped hydro and harnessing the sea for clean energy.
Startups have tried reinventing pumped hydro by running train cars filled with rocks uphill, loading up ski-lift-style cable systems with weights, and stacking enormous blocks with robotic cranes.
Traditional pumped hydro does this by filling a large reservoir with water.
The power equipment costs less than 700 euros ($810) per kilowatt in the long term, competitive with pumped hydro, Aufiero said.","The ocean has beckoned to legions of energy entrepreneurs before dashing their hopes against the rocks. Now a new company is heeding the siren call — but with a twist.

Italy’s Sizable Energy launched in 2022 to build pumped hydro energy storage under the ocean. Cofounder and CEO Manuele Aufiero pursues that outlandish vision with the methodical diligence he picked up as a seasoned nuclear engineer. Now, the firm has deep-water wave testing under its belt, and in October it closed $8 million in seed funding to build its first offshore demonstration project.

This venture takes aim at two longstanding, elusive cleantech dreams: reinventing pumped hydro and harnessing the sea for clean energy. It’s an ambitious project that must navigate choppy seas, literally and figuratively, to succeed. But if Sizable can pull it off, it would unlock low-cost, long-duration storage that could accelerate the broader shift to clean energy.

Even as lithium-ion batteries surge in popularity, legacy pumped-hydro projects still store more gigawatt-hours than any other technology. The latter harnesses gravity, using excess electricity to pump water uphill and releasing it to turn turbines when more energy is needed. This simple, century-old technology rarely gets built anymore, however; besides the environmental implications of forming enormous reservoirs, today’s fast-moving energy markets aren’t particularly encouraging for power plants that take many years to build and cost billions of dollars up front.

That’s not to say pumped hydro never gets built, Aufiero told me — Switzerland recently completed a facility in a high mountain valley, but it took 14 years. Part of the problem there is that every mountain is different, he explained: the height, flow rate, and energy equipment must be customized for each location.

But the ocean, he said, offers the chance to standardize this otherwise bespoke tech — making it far easier and quicker to deploy.

“We are unfolding the possibility of building the system even before knowing exactly where you are going to deploy,” he said. ​“We do that by deploying offshore. Water is the same everywhere.”

Specifically, Sizable has designed a gravity-based storage system that shuttles a briny liquid up and down a vertical pipe affixed to the seafloor. Inflatable membranes form reservoirs at the bottom and on the surface; from above, it looks like a giant floating donut. The system connects to the land-based grid, and uses power to pump the brine up through the plastic pipe. Reversing that regenerates power.

Startups have tried reinventing pumped hydro by running train cars filled with rocks uphill, loading up ski-lift-style cable systems with weights, and stacking enormous blocks with robotic cranes. Each of those started with the same claims about mechanical simplicity and ended up in the junkyard of cleantech ideas. But where those ventures started on the ground and had to build up, Sizable Energy starts on the ocean surface and goes down.

“There’s a lot of ocean depth in the world — it’s not oversubscribed,” said Bruce Leak, general partner at Playground Global, which led the seed round.

Scalable, long-duration storage

The relatively low costs of Sizable’s design could make it competitive for long-duration storage, something experts think the grid needs but nobody has really delivered yet.

Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly competitive for shorter durations, like four hours. But they get prohibitively expensive for much longer than that. To deliver the same megawatt capacity over 12 or 24 hours (through the night or a whole day of cloudy weather) requires stacking a bunch more batteries, and that stacks the cost.

Any company that wants to compete in long-duration storage has to find materials and designs that make it dirt cheap to add hours of capacity. Traditional pumped hydro does this by filling a large reservoir with water. Sizable chose a double-walled membrane to fill with brine, which fits the cheap and scalable bill. Adding more vertical feet of plastic pipe is pretty inexpensive, too.

The power equipment costs less than 700 euros ($810) per kilowatt in the long term, competitive with pumped hydro, Aufiero said. Where the technology really shines is in the marginal cost of adding more storage duration: less than 20 euros ($23) per kilowatt-hour, at scale. That’s right on par with what Form Energy is targeting with its iron-air battery, an attempt at a mass-produced electrochemical battery for 100 hours of duration.

Sizable is shooting for eight hours to 24 and beyond. The economics improve at a larger scale: If you’ve got to install a mooring system and connect a marine cable to the grid, you might as well ship more power through it rather than less.

That’ll take some time to work up to. Sizable already built a kilowatt-scale proof of concept, which it floated at the Natural Ocean Engineering Laboratory in Reggio Calabria, Italy. In September, the company subjected its design to a bombardment of artificial waves in the gigantic pool at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands, which vets the durability of marine engineering. The successful performance in those tests set the stage for the recent fundraising round.

With the cash infusion, the team is building a 1-megawatt device, which will sport a 50-meter (164-foot) radius and occupy up to 500 meters (1,640 feet) of ocean column off the coast of Reggio Calabria.

Sizable is funding this project itself, since it can’t yet show financiers the real-world performance data they need to underwrite investment. It will be fully functional, using scaled-down components because of its diminutive size, but it won’t connect to the grid. Sizable has already secured a 10-megawatt grid connection in southern Italy for its first truly commercial development.

Survive the ocean, but keep it simple

The unenviable challenge facing Aufiero is to fortify his invention against the torments of the sea, without spending so much money armoring it that it loses its low cost.

“Doing something in the ocean, it is a challenge, but it’s also an opportunity for massive scalability,” Aufiero said. He set out to design a ​“simple system that can be scaled without too many surprises.”

Wave action has literally sunk many hopeful ocean-energy pilot projects. But such devices in the past sought to harness the renewable power of the waves through direct contact. Sizable Energy only needs the ocean as a uniform space to operate in, so its technology tries to minimize wave contact as much as possible.

Two outer rings of plastic pipe were engineered to disrupt waves before they hit the floating reservoir. In the event that strong surf or heavy rain threatens to weigh down the reservoir, bilge pumps activate to clear out the liquid.

In Europe, people have been leasing seabed for energy projects at grand scale for decades. Sizable will apply to the same regulatory bodies that oversee offshore wind, but needs a much smaller footprint per megawatt.

In fact, offshore wind farms are an attractive potential site for the startup’s contraption, Aufiero said. By colocating, Sizable could share the export cables, and firm up the booms and busts of wind generation by storing it locally and distributing it to the grid as needed. Leak, the investor, likened this pairing to transforming an offshore wind plant into a nuclear power plant by converting variable generation into predictable, baseload clean energy.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Sizable-Energy-test-site.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4c9a8d8b5bc855c7a9d9004284e797ed,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:49.532959

How does the European energy sector turn shared ambition into collaborative action?

The energy transition is, and will always be, a team sport. Europe's shared ambition for a sustainable and resilient energy future is effectively translated into collaborative action through a powerful combination of EU-level strategic frameworks, robust financial instruments, and relentless technological innovation.

Initiatives like the Affordable Energy Action Plan, a cornerstone of the Green Deal, have significantly accelerated investments in renewable energy generation, driven industrial decarbonisation, and fostered critical investments in clean tech manufacturing.

Furthermore, the increasing number of cross-border interconnectors stands as a tangible testament to this shared commitment, demonstrating how nations are working together to achieve over 50% renewable energy by 2030. It's about creating an ecosystem where policy, finance, and technology converge to drive real change.

What does Europe need to do to deliver competitive, resilient energy by 2030?

The recent spikes in energy prices have clearly shown that a singular push for renewable energy, while crucial, won't do the magic on its own.

We need a fundamental rethinking of our energy mix, acknowledging that today, a broader spectrum of options is on the table.

Given that 2030 is a very short timeframe, it's imperative to swiftly complete projects already underway, rigorously implement F-gas-free regulations, and significantly expedite permits for battery energy storage system projects to unlock much-needed grid flexibility.

Beyond that, we must ensure supply chain resilience through a strong ‘Make in Europe’ initiative, fostering strategic autonomy and creating a level playing field for sustainability in public procurement for power equipment and services.

Finally, accelerating the adoption of digital and AI technologies is non-negotiable, but always with robust guardrails around data sovereignty and cybersecurity to ensure secure operations.

Is there another vertical industry which has vital lessons for the energy sector?

The world is more connected than ever. Our hyperconnected lifestyles, the digitalisation of industries, IoT deployment, the evolution of AI – all generate unprecedented volumes of data. As digital demand explodes, data centres are one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. As they power digitalisation across sectors, their operations are scaling to keep up — becoming critical infrastructure as the backbone of our digital society.

Data centres are one such vertical that offers important learnings, for example, in the choice of primary energy mix. Here we see multiple options such as small modular reactors, microgrids and hybrid energy mix, showcasing the many options in primary energy mix. There is also a strong focus on energy efficiency starting from the design phase, with lessons learnt from efficient cooling systems and the use of digital twins and artificial intelligence.

Standardisation of components and modularisation of products and systems are other features that the energy sector can learn from, whether it is integration of distributed energy resources or speeding up power-generating stations from design, construction to grid connection. Finally, data centres’ participation in demand response and other flexibility mechanisms also demonstrates how the energy sector can encourage flexible demand-side participation from industrial users and prosumers.

COP30: are you optimistic or pessimistic? What should it deliver to make true impact?

I’m cautiously optimistic. The choice of location deep in the Amazon is powerfully symbolic. The Amazon rainforest, often called the lungs of our planet, underscores the urgency of protecting vital ecosystems.

This year, the International Court of Justice reaffirmed that states have a legal duty to safeguard the climate, reinforcing that the 1.5°C target is not just aspirational: it’s a shared global responsibility.

There is encouraging momentum: over 100 countries are aligning behind climate action, and the commitment to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035 is a significant step. But ambition alone isn’t enough. For COP30 to make a real impact, we need concrete mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, and collaboration across sectors and borders.

What is the biggest workforce issue for the energy transition?

The energy transition is creating millions of jobs worldwide in renewables, electrification, and digital technologies. However, the workforce issue is a complex interplay of recruiting, reskilling, and retention. Worldwide we see a lot of experienced engineers ageing and on the verge of retirement. Hiring new professionals is not so easy due to competition from IT and other sectors. The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) recruitment pipeline is also weak and suffers from a geographical mismatch in demand and supply. All these factors are bringing reskilling and retention into greater focus.

Is the energy sector making the most of the current AI tech?

The energy sector is not yet making the most of current AI technologies, but it is a rapidly evolving technology and is gaining acceptance around predictive maintenance. Benefits that are being realised include: reduced downtime and costs in turbines, transformers, and grid assets, or grid optimisation in balancing demand and supply and distributed energy resources integration. However, to scale beyond pilots, we need to connect the data residing in organisational silos, foster more AI literacy and cross-functional collaboration, and build strong guardrails around AI governance.

What sustainability practice in your organisation are you most proud of? And personally?

The Siemens Degree framework is an ambitious but holistic programme with strong focus around decarbonisation and sustainability for our company. To successfully tread the path of a sustainable future, there is a need for innovative, eco-friendly, and digital solutions. One pillar of the Siemens Degree framework is the Siemens Eco Tech label. It is an environmental declaration for our products based on product-specific evaluations of sustainability-relevant KPIs. It’s validated by TÜV Rheinland, providing additional proof of the correct and standardised approach of conducting our data.

Additionally, we at Siemens Electrification & Automation are proud of our F-gas-free switchgear portfolio for the entire medium-voltage range. With our blue GIS portfolio for medium-voltage power supply, we are prepared for the energy transition and digital transformation. Our Microgrid portfolio is helping with sustainable electrification for off-grid communities or supporting our customers in double peak avoidance, thus economically managing the grid with peak demand.

On a personal level, I believe in leading by example. Beyond conscious choices like reducing meat consumption and prioritising public transportation or cycling, I actively seek out products with lower embedded carbon footprints. It’s about making mindful decisions in daily life.

What are the biggest challenges facing energy leaders today?

In 2025, energy leaders are navigating what I would describe as a perfect storm of interconnected challenges. Foremost among these is the constant balancing act of the energy trilemma: ensuring energy security, maintaining affordability for consumers and industries, and driving sustainability. This is further complicated by the imperative to build robust supply chain resilience in an increasingly volatile global landscape.

Beyond these, we grapple with significant regulatory complexity and often unpredictable policy uncertainty, which can hinder long-term investment and planning. Finally, the rapid pace of workforce transformation, as we discussed earlier, presents a critical challenge in ensuring we have the right skills and talent to execute the transition. These challenges are not isolated; we need to be aware of this.

How are your industry experts going to address these challenges at Enlit Europe?

At Enlit Europe in Bilbao, our Siemens experts will demonstrate how we are not just responding to the challenges of the energy transition — we are helping to lead it.

We’ll showcase our medium-voltage blue GIS portfolio, which reflects our commitment to F-gas-free, environmentally friendly, and highly reliable grid infrastructure. In parallel, we’ll highlight how our grid software and consulting services are empowering utilities to optimise operations, enhance resilience, and accelerate decarbonisation for the autonomous grid of tomorrow.

A key focus will be our Electrification X portfolio, which combines the real and digital worlds. Through use cases, we’ll illustrate how Siemens enables intelligent load management, smart asset performance through predictive analytics, and robust cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructure.

If you had a magic wand what is one thing you would implement today?

If I had a magic wand, I would go back in time, armed with all the knowledge and technological measures we possess today, and reverse the global warming clock. It would be an opportunity to prevent the climate crisis from reaching its current critical point, allowing us to build a sustainable future from a position of strength rather than urgency.","https://enlit.stream.prepr.io/1rgigcdbpvf5/w_1600,h_900,c_center/siemens-ag-puneet-singh.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 06:20:55.011780

So, it’s a pretty good amount of growth and somewhat strong for our soybean oil and other vegetable oil and feedstocks that go into biomass-based diesel.”

So, the combined effect of higher Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), tighter restrictions on small refinery exemptions (SREs), and a mandatory reallocation mechanism is set to increase the required volume of biomass-based diesel for calendar years 2026 and 2027.

Africa, responsible for less than 4% of emissions, faces worsening climate impacts

UNEP warns adaptation finance gap remains 12–14 times current funding levels

African Union Commission President Mahmoud Ali Youssouf has issued a strong call for climate justice on the eve of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. He reminded that Africa, which contributes less than 4% of global emissions, continues to bear the brunt of climate disruption.

Speaking at a roundtable on adaptation goals, Youssouf urged industrialized countries to meet their financial commitments to vulnerable nations. He stressed that these pledges should be seen not as aid but as a “moral and historical responsibility.” He also emphasized that Africa is not passive, citing the AU’s Climate Strategy (2022–2032), the Decade of Smart Agriculture, the Blue Economy Strategy, and the Mission 300 initiative for clean energy access as examples of proactive action toward resilience and prosperity.

“The industrialized nations must honor their adaptation funding promises, not as charity but as a moral and historical responsibility,” Youssouf said, calling for the full operationalization of the Global Goal on Adaptation to move from plans to action and ensure fair, predictable funding.

However, commitments have often fallen short. According to the UN Environment Program’s “Adaptation Gap Report 2025,” developing countries need $310 billion annually for adaptation, compared with only $26 billion in international public flows in 2023. The report highlights that needs are 12 to 14 times higher than current funding levels, warning that the Glasgow Climate Pact target to double adaptation finance between 2020 and 2025 will not be met.

Held for the first time in the Amazon region, COP30 is set to open on Monday, November 10, with a focus on nature-based solutions and ecosystem protection.

The department projected a 104-gigawatt loss due to plant retirements by 2030, which could lead to more than 800 hours of outages annually.
Moreover, the DOE's claims that clean energy sources are exacerbating blackouts have been debunked by Princeton University's ZERO Lab, as Canary Media explained.
But as the energy experts explained, clean energy sources are not fueling the risk of blackouts.
Researchers believed the DOE intentionally omitted data to prioritize dirty fuels and undermine the clean energy boom.","A Department of Energy report found that blackouts could increase a hundredfold by 2030 if the United States doesn't drastically ramp up grid capacity during peak hours, according to Reuters.

What's happening?

The report determined that plant retirements, coupled with a failure to add capacity, could lead to a ""surge in power outages,"" particularly as growing demand from artificial intelligence data centers strains grids.

Data centers require immense amounts of electricity. Although some use clean energy sources like wind and solar, they will consume twice as much energy by 2030, per Scientific American.

If the U.S. can't keep up with demand, ""most regions will face unacceptable reliability risks within five years,"" the report found.

The department projected a 104-gigawatt loss due to plant retirements by 2030, which could lead to more than 800 hours of outages annually. It further recommended adding capacity via coal and gas.

""President Trump's administration is committed to advancing a strategy of energy addition, and supporting all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,"" said energy secretary Chris Wright. ""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""

Why is this concerning?

Large-scale blackouts pose a serious threat to the economy, national security, and daily life, and vulnerable communities — including low-income households and those with underlying health conditions — bear the most risk.

Moreover, the DOE's claims that clean energy sources are exacerbating blackouts have been debunked by Princeton University's ZERO Lab, as Canary Media explained.

The current energy crisis is driven by several factors, including a massive boom in data center deployment, increased extreme weather, and skyrocketing demand for electricity for AI applications.

But as the energy experts explained, clean energy sources are not fueling the risk of blackouts.

According to ZERO lab, the DOE overestimated plant retirements and underestimated new generation capacity anticipated in the same period. Researchers believed the DOE intentionally omitted data to prioritize dirty fuels and undermine the clean energy boom.

With battery energy storage systems rapidly coming online — Utility Dive reported that capacity is expected to more than double by 2027 — experts expect significant grid stability even as power plants are phased out.

How can you prepare for potential outages?

Going solar is one of the most effective ways to slash utility bills and your home's environmental impact.

EnergySage provides instant solar quotes and connects you with vetted contractors at no cost, ensuring your lights stay on — even during increasing blackouts, when paired with a battery backup.

Its free mapping tool even shows customers average local home solar costs, available incentives, and rebates on a state-by-state basis. On average, EnergySage users save up to $10,000 on new installations.

For those on a budget, Palmetto's LightReach leasing program has $0 down options, allowing customers to lock in low energy rates and reliable service without a large upfront investment.

Pairing solar with an energy-efficient heat pump boosts energy savings by $400 a year on average, according to Rewiring America — and Mitsubishi makes it easy for homeowners to find the right heat pump and installer for their needs and budget.

Those who plan to claim a 30% solar or heat pump tax credit should act before they expire at the end of 2025, per Canary Media.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/blackoutsimage-recuWtSEBDXb6ttid.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 02:21:09.761621

NOTEBOOK:

Only a small number of Shelby County students were retained under Indiana’s new third-grade reading requirements, according to recently released data. State law requires students to demonstrate reading proficiency on the IREAD-3 exam or qualify for a “good cause” exemption to be promoted to fourth grade. Morristown Elementary and Triton Central Elementary each had one student retained, while four students at Coulston Elementary and two at Loper Elementary did not receive promotion. Data for other schools were suppressed by the state because fewer than 10 students were affected, reflecting Indiana’s privacy policy for small-reporting groups. Statewide figures showed modest increases in retention rates as schools adjusted to stricter promotion rules.

As part of Veterans Day activities at Shelbyville High School, students will watch an interview I conducted with U.S. Army veteran Dr. Holly Everette, a Shelby County resident, in segments on GBTV. We will share that interview throughout the week here. Below is part one, to be shown today. - Kristiaan Rawlings

Shelbyville High School’s Breck Auditorium will transform into Bikini Bottom as students present “The SpongeBob Musical” this weekend, Friday, Nov. 14, and Saturday, Nov. 15. Both performances begin at 7 p.m. The family-friendly production brings the beloved cartoon to life with colorful characters, lively music and plenty of undersea fun. Tickets, available at the door, are $10 for adults and $8 for students.

HOOSIER NEWS: Bobcat trapping season began Saturday across 40 Indiana counties, primarily in the southern region, including Monroe, Brown, Morgan and Orange counties. Shelby County is not included. The season continues through Jan. 31 or until the statewide quota of 250 is reached, with each licensed trapper limited to one bobcat. This marks Indiana’s first regulated bobcat harvest season following a 2024 state law requiring the Department of Natural Resources to establish one. Hunting is not permitted; only trapping is allowed using foothold, cage or cable devices. DNR officials said the limited season is designed to be sustainable and will not threaten the species’ recovery. (Indiana Public Media)

NATIONAL NEWS: The Farmers’ Almanac, a 208-year-old publication known for its long-range weather forecasts and homespun wisdom, will cease publication after its 2026 edition due to financial challenges in the modern media landscape. Founded in 1818 and based in Maine since 1955, the almanac offered readers forecasts based on sunspots and lunar cycles, along with gardening tips, trivia and natural remedies. The print and online editions will both conclude, marking the end of one of America’s longest-running publications alongside its counterpart, the Old Farmer’s Almanac. (IBJ)

1995: Shelby County was required to clean up soil contamination left by a leaking underground storage tank behind the courthouse, which had gone untreated for more than two years. Tests showed benzene levels 66 times the state limit, and although the county had complied with earlier directives, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management later requested further investigation. The issue resurfaced as the county considered using the site for courthouse expansion.

1985: Tippecanoe Press, 223 S. Harrison Street, began offering computer diskettes and minidisks for sale.

1975: Five sixth-graders from Loper Elementary School were rewarded for outstanding reading achievement with a field trip to Indianapolis. Led by teacher Mrs. Joan Gardner, the students visited the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Children’s Museum, Crown Hill National and Military Cemeteries, Lafayette Square and Weir Cook Airport. The students were Jayme Anderson, Bruce Carpenter, Mark Coers, Rhonda House and Bobby Jeffries.

1965: The Edwin M. Morner Floral Co., 11 East South Street, celebrated its 50th anniversary with an open house.

1955: Shelbyville and Shelby County recorded 80 births and 30 deaths in October, nearly tripling the death rate, according to County Health Officer Dr. Wilson L. Dalton.

Bob Adams, 13, son of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Adams, was named the local winner of the Optimist International oratorical contest held at the Eagles Lodge.

1935: Supervised gym classes for adults in Shelbyville were scheduled to begin at Hendricks School, with sessions for men on Monday and Tuesday nights and a women’s class on Fridays. Recreation Director Martin Luther announced the program, which was free to participants and emphasized physical conditioning. Attendees were asked to bring a gym suit, rubber-soled shoes and a towel.

1925: Vandegrift & Morris issued a reminder that vehicle oil should be changed every 500 miles.

A Shelbyville concert band of 22 local musicians was organized during a meeting at the First National Bank’s community room. Marvin Hill was named director, with officers including Rollyn Barnes as president, Everett Hinds as vice president, Jay Wintin as secretary and treasurer, and Joseph Ainsley as librarian. The independent group planned to begin rehearsals immediately and hoped to schedule its first public concert soon.

1915: Peter J. Lux of Prescott, southeast of Shelbyville, was awarded the grand champion sweepstakes of the world at the National Corn Show in Columbus, Missouri, for the finest 10 ears of white corn.

André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in “mutirão,” a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.

“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”

Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.

“I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. “The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.

“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said.

The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the negotiations to a potluck dinner.

“Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,” which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. “And it’s obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.”

“The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,” Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.

In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.”

Not only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives,” Stiell wrote.

Sydney [Australia], November 10: ACEN Australia's Stubbo Solar project has become the first solar generator supported by a Long-Term Energy Service Agreement (LTESA) to reach full commercial operation, marking a defining moment in New South Wales' clean energy transition.

Developed ahead of the formal establishment of the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), Stubbo Solar bridged two policy eras and now stands as one of the largest solar projects ever built in Australia.

ACEN Australia marked the milestone for the AUS $760 million, 520 MWdc (400 MWac) project with an onsite ceremony on Friday, attended by New South Wales Minister for Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Heritage Penny Sharpe.

She was joined by Ayala Corporation President and CEO and ACEN Chairman Cezar ""Bong"" Consing, ACEN President and CEO Eric Francia, and ACEN Australia Executive Chairman Jose Maria Zabaleta, together with the ACEN Australia team, to celebrate this milestone last week.

""Stubbo Solar reinforces ACEN's long-term commitment to Australia's clean energy future. This milestone highlights how clear policy and strong partnerships can unlock large-scale renewable investments. It also reflects the dedication of our ACEN Australia team and partners whose collaboration and hard work turned this project into a powerful example of what's possible in the energy transition,"" said ACEN Australia Executive Chairman Jose Maria Zabaleta.

ACEN Australia Managing Director David Pollington said Stubbo's story began several years ago, long before the policy frameworks now shaping Australia's renewable energy landscape were in place. ""What started as a single-site concept has become one of the most significant renewable energy investments in regional New South Wales, built through partnership, persistence, and strategic adaptation,"" Mr. Pollington said.

He added that as the market evolves, costs are rising, delivery conditions are changing rapidly, and market dynamics are shifting -- pressures that reinforce the importance of partnership between government and industry to ensure policy settings remain responsive, effective, and investment-ready. ACEN Australia, he said, is proud to be part of this transition and looks forward to working closely with the New South Wales Government, partners, and stakeholders to deliver the next wave of clean, reliable, and affordable energy for the state.

Stubbo's successful delivery was made possible through strong partnerships across the project ecosystem.

PCL Construction served as ACEN Australia's engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, while Lumea, the commercial arm of Transgrid specializing in renewable energy grid connections and infrastructure services, partnered with ACEN Australia to deliver a safe and efficient connection to the New South Wales electricity network.

Stubbo Solar has also been designed with the provision for a 200 MW / 800 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), positioning the site to provide firming capacity and ensure reliable clean energy as the grid continues to decarbonize.

Stubbo Solar also recently became the first large-scale solar project certified for full circularity under the Circular PV Alliance framework, ensuring that all 930,000 solar panels will be reused or recycled at end of life -- setting a new sustainability benchmark for the industry.

Driving regional growth and local partnerships

During construction, ACEN Australia invested nearly AUS $85 million into the NSW economy, including AUS $60 million in contracts, jobs, and procurement for businesses within the Mid-Western Regional Council area and surrounding local government areas.

The project also contributed AUS $3.2 million to First Nations businesses, and over AUS $400,000 to community initiatives through its voluntary Social Investment Program, supporting education, skills, and local well-being.

Located about 10 km north of Gulgong in central-west NSW, Stubbo Solar can generate enough clean electricity to power 185,000 Australian households.

Miliband said the Cop30 talks with 196 other countries and the EU would matter for Britons who had more immediate concerns such as inflation.
The government’s plans would create 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030, the energy secretary added.
“The implementation of the Paris Agreement is not just working but is accelerating beyond what we possibly could have thought of ten years ago,” Figueres added.
But you cannot argue that the Paris Agreement is unsuccessful.”","“The world is moving on climate and clean energy, but it needs to move faster,” Miliband said.

“We are going to unashamedly say that this shows that multilateralism can work. Working together is the right thing for Britain.”

The minister cited the prediction that the Earth had been on course for 4C of global warming before the 2015 Paris Agreement, a temperature rise that would have been disastrous, but is now heading for about 2.5C. “That shows the progress that has been made,” he said.

Miliband said the Cop30 talks with 196 other countries and the EU would matter for Britons who had more immediate concerns such as inflation. “It matters precisely because of the cost of living, because if we are going to create good jobs for the future, this is the biggest potential opportunity we have,” he said.

• No countries sign up for Keir Starmer’s global clean power alliance

A book published on November 5 by Lord Stern of Brentford, a renowned economist who produced a major climate report for Gordon Brown, said action on climate change was not an obstacle to prosperity but was “the only really sensible way of driving growth”.

Stern told The Times his message to the Tories, who recently joined Reform in calling for the scrapping of Britain’s 2050 net zero target, was that renewables and green technology were “your growth story”.

Miliband echoed that view. “We need to move faster, because it’s in our national interest in terms of jobs and economic growth,” he said.

The government’s plans would create 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030, the energy secretary added. He also said action on climate change would create “huge opportunities for exports” including for “mini” nuclear power stations being developed by Rolls-Royce.

Labour has been criticised by environmentalists for refusing to pay into a new fund to save rainforests, launched by Brazil on November 6. Miliband blamed the coming budget, which is expected to bring in tax rises to repair public finances. “We’ve obviously got a difficult fiscal event coming up, so we weren’t in a position to make a financial contribution at this stage to the TFFF,” he said, referring to the rainforest fund.

One of the architects of the Paris Agreement said that progress on climate change was being driven more by the falling cost of clean energy than by government negotiations.

Christiana Figueres, who was UN climate chief when the deal was reached, said: “Ten years ago, the logic of climate was climate politics. Today, the logic of climate is climate economics, because the technologies that we’re using [to replace fossil fuels] are cheaper, they’re better-performing, and they’re faster to build.”

• The SNP’s duplicity on net zero policies is fuelling no one

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, solar power is now on average 41 per cent cheaper than fossil fuels. Electric cars are already cheaper to run than petrol models.

“The implementation of the Paris Agreement is not just working but is accelerating beyond what we possibly could have thought of ten years ago,” Figueres added. “Investment in renewables is already two times higher than in fossil fuels.”

She said countries are shifting to clean energy faster than implied by their climate targets, some of which she said had been less ambitious than planned because of “the bullying we see from Washington”.

Figueres said: “Are we going in the right direction? Absolutely. Do we have to go to more scale and more speed? Absolutely. But you cannot argue that the Paris Agreement is unsuccessful.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F58510a09-583c-4553-a4f3-4ca8ad24e620.jpg?crop=5392%2C3033%2C0%2C532&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-10 01:21:08.860860

The administration has also disrupted high-profile wind and solar projects, with interior secretary Doug Burgum saying these “massive, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving energy dominance”.
“Projects on the margins might not necessarily collapse but will need restructuring,” says Pol Lezcano, director of energy and renewables at CBRE.
According to LevelTen Energy — a renewable energy marketplace — wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices rose by 14 per cent year on year and solar PPA prices by 6 per cent year on year.
According to E2, a clean energy business group, 85 per cent of Inflation Reduction Act investments are in Republican-held congressional districts.","In Nevada, the desert blooms with solar panels. The state generates just over one-third of its electricity from sunlight, and plans to add enough solar capacity over the next five years to power nearly 2mn homes.

But the state’s solar build-out may now be under threat, after what would have been the largest solar farm in North America — Esmeralda 7 — had its environmental review cancelled by the US interior department last month.

While the project’s developers can reapply for approval, critics say it is the latest move by the government to hobble the US green energy transition, creating uncertainty for developers, investors and consumers.

Since President Donald Trump’s second term started in January, he has cut incentives for renewables under the Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. The administration has also disrupted high-profile wind and solar projects, with interior secretary Doug Burgum saying these “massive, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving energy dominance”.

The interior department’s actions are likely to cause an investment freeze and send deployments of renewable projects plummeting. Data gathered by BloombergNEF shows investments in US renewables fell by 36 per cent in the first half of 2025. Meanwhile, according to Rhodium Group, Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful tax and spending bill — which cut many of the sector’s tax credits — will shrink the build-out of new clean power generating capacity by 53-59 per cent from 2025 to 2035.

“Whether or not you agreed with everything the Inflation Reduction Act did, it gave you policy stability,” says Reagan Farr, chief executive of solar developer Silicon Ranch. “With the One Big Beautiful Bill you’ve now tied energy policy to whichever party is in power.”

In the short term, a flurry of activity is under way in the sector. To catch the tail-end of the tax credits, new projects must start construction before July 2026 and be placed in service after four years. This has led to developers rushing to secure equipment, start building and sign deals to sell their power to utilities, corporations and public sector clients.

“There’s a huge rush to secure the tax credits and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a huge wave of deal announcements,” says Luca Pedretti, chief operating officer of Pexapark, a renewables marketplace platform.

But experts warn that after this sharp increase, development will slump and prices will increase. While larger, more established developers with shovel-ready projects will be able to secure the credits, smaller developers will struggle.

“Projects on the margins might not necessarily collapse but will need restructuring,” says Pol Lezcano, director of energy and renewables at CBRE. “And smaller developers will find it much harder to raise finance and find buyers.”

Trump’s trade war is also affecting some developers’ ability to build. Tariffs on key components such as steel, aluminium and copper, as well as country-specific tariffs, are driving up costs.

According to LevelTen Energy — a renewable energy marketplace — wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices rose by 14 per cent year on year and solar PPA prices by 6 per cent year on year.

Both factors are expected to lead to higher electricity prices in the future.

“Power purchase agreement prices are a canary in the coal mine for what we might see downstream in wholesale and retail electricity prices,” says Rob Collier, energy marketplace senior vice-president at LevelTen. “The big risk is tariffs.”

Developers may also see further turbulence for major projects. As well as halting Esmeralda 7, which was backed by renewables company NextEra Energy, the interior department also stopped — and then restarted — work on two wind farms: Equinor’s Empire Wind off the coast of New York and Ørsted’s Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Projects on federal lands must now undergo an elevated review process and be rubber-stamped by Burgum’s office. However, since only 5 to 10 per cent of projects are on federal lands, the more important battles will be left to the states, says Antonio Cammisecra, chief executive of ContourGlobal, an independent power producer.

According to E2, a clean energy business group, 85 per cent of Inflation Reduction Act investments are in Republican-held congressional districts. But whether or not states decide to block a project is complicated, since they bring benefits in the form of employment and tax income.

Trump has also prompted companies to pare back their green targets. In recent earnings calls, executives from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies emphasised their shift towards finding new oil and gas reserves after earlier moves into renewables. However, experts say that companies are unlikely — and should not — drop their green targets altogether.

“What happens if a new administration comes in and is even more aggressive on the environmental front?,” says Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at OPIS. “If I was a chief executive, I’d have my eye on our future liabilities as far as the environment is concerned.”",https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F756364b7-8761-49ba-a640-8ff584d4800c.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-11-10 00:20:11.439463

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers — including data centers not even built yet.
Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.
“If you set aside a few sates with higher rates, the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates,"" Maloney said.","Nov. 9, 2025 (AP) – Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year's midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who's footing the bill to power Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average — although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,” said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.

Rising electric costs aren’t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year's campaigns.

Higher electric bills on the horizon

Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.

With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, “it’s a life or death and ‘eat or heat’ type decision that people have to make,” said Charles Hua, PowerLines' founder.

In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of “rubber-stamping” rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.

Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.

Hubbard's message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see “more affordable pricing. That’s the main thing. It’s running my pocket right now.”

Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share — or share it with regular ratepayers.

Midterm battlegrounds in hotspots

Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots — or both — are fomenting community uprisings.

That includes California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.

That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.

Also playing a role is explosive demand from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising natural gas prices, analysts say.

“The cost of utility service is the new ‘cost of eggs’ concern for a lot of consumers,” said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.

In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.

Meanwhile, communities that don't want to live next to one are pushing back.

It's on voters' minds

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October found that electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

Now, as falls turns to winter, some states are warning that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown.

Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a “major” source of stress.

And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.

For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers — including data centers not even built yet.

Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.

That’s spurred governors from the region — including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection — to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.

High-rate states vs. lower-rate rates

Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, suggested that only some states are the drivers of higher average electric bills.

“If you set aside a few sates with higher rates, the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates,"" Maloney said.

Examples of states with faster-rising rates are California, where wildfires are driving grid upgrades, and those in New England, where natural gas is expensive because of strained pipeline capacity.

Still, other states are feeling a pinch.

In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state's for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying “we can’t take it anymore.”

As part of the pilot phase, three villages—Alamgir, Siarh (both in Payal block) and one in Dakha block—have been shortlisted to host 1 MW solar power plants each. The project aims to utilise 10 to 20 acres of unencumbered shamlat land per site, chosen based on proximity to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) grid to ensure smooth integration of generated power.

Officials said the initiative will enable gram panchayats to generate sustainable income from underutilised community land through lease rentals or profit-sharing models. As per state regulations, 25% of the shamlat land will remain with the panchayat for community use, ensuring that development does not compromise local access or traditional land functions.

“The idea is to create a model that combines clean energy generation with community benefit,” said a senior district official. “By using common land for solar installations, we can strengthen local economies, promote self-reliance, and contribute to the state’s renewable energy goals.”

The Ludhiana administration has already completed site assessments for the identified villages, and the project is expected to begin implementation soon. Once operational, each solar plant will feed power directly into the PSPCL grid, supporting Punjab’s mission to expand decentralized clean energy capacity.

Officials noted that while the project offers a strong opportunity for rural revenue generation, challenges such as land consolidation, project maintenance, and grid connectivity will need to be managed carefully.

When you go off to college, try not to own a car, and see where alternative transportation can take you.","The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has laid out four main ways to decarbonize the transportation industry, which accounts for 29% of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions that are plunging our planet into a bleak (and scorching) future.

However, their suggestion to switch en masse to electric vehicles (EVs) has received the majority of the national attention in the past decade, including in the Biden administration’s EV rebates.

Many people believe that buying an electric car is a sufficient solution to decrease their carbon footprint, and the data certainly points in that direction: various scientific reviews sponsored by, for example, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the International Council on Clean Transportation, have found that green-energy powered cars have one-fifth of the lifetime emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles.

However, electric vehicles are not the transportation silver bullet. They are merely a part of the solution.

I believe that the overwhelming focus on electrifying the American private vehicle fleet has actually distracted us from a more holistic solution, which is summarized well in the final, often-overlooked strategy laid out by the EPA on their website: decreasing the amount that people drive.

One reason why electric vehicles are not the perfect solution that some make them out to be is that they still come with the vast majority of the negative impacts of cars.

Firstly, according to a study sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, electric cars cause more greenhouse gas emissions in their production than gasoline-powered cars do, producing the equivalent of taking 15 cross-country flights before they even hit the road. The manufacture of an average e-bike, on the other hand, produces 86 times fewer emissions.

Beyond carbon emissions, law professor Gregory Shill argued in a 2019 article in The Atlantic that “85% to 90% of toxic vehicle emissions in traffic come from tire wear and other non-tailpipe sources,” which electric cars do not mitigate.

While it doesn’t contribute to global warming, particulate matter produced primarily from tires is still no joke — it pollutes our air and water with microplastics. A study from the Journal of Transport Technology has linked such emissions to an increased risk of asthma in kids, as well as various neurological issues such as depression, anxiety, and even Alzheimer’s.

As if this isn’t enough, this same study reasoned that the political prioritization of electric vehicles “is unlikely to result in large reductions in deaths, injuries, injustices, or the environmental damage caused by automobility,” emphasizing the broad-reaching impact of our car-centric society.

While electric cars aren’t much better than internal combustion engine cars, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have a hazy future and only perpetuate societal car-centrism. Many people envision them as the next logical development of vehicles, since they may prove safer than human drivers in many cases and would also enable would-be drivers to be productive during travel rather than focusing all of their energy on driving.

These are very real possibilities that would improve the lives of those dependent on cars, but in my opinion AVs raise more questions than they answer.

For instance, would the widespread adoption of AVs actually decrease the amount of traffic in cities, or would empty cars circling around waiting for passengers cause a corresponding increase in traffic?

It is likely that autonomous vehicles will eventually dominate the private vehicle fleet as people seek out the benefits that they bring over regular vehicles, but they are still cars with all the same downsides, and it is important to consider that many of their benefits, such as being productive while traveling, can be reaped simply through the use of public transportation.

I could explain at length the negative externalities of cars, but this article isn’t called “The Anti-Car Manifesto.” I am writing this article because we live in the Silicon Valley region, where technological innovation is praised and thus sought out in every facet of our society.

However, the desire to innovate our way out of the issues posed by our car-centric society while holding cars up on a pedestal leads us to push unideal solutions, such as the widespread adoption of autonomous and electric vehicles, as if they are the only option. In reality, they should be one of many tools used to decarbonize transportation along with the less flashy but proven technologies of public transportation and active transportation.

In sum, EVs and AVs both inflict numerous negative impacts on their surroundings, a consequence inherent to the fact that they are still cars. My recommendation? Consider biking, walking, or taking the bus to school, to start. When you go off to college, try not to own a car, and see where alternative transportation can take you.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.
In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers — including data centers not even built yet.
Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.
“If you set aside a few sates with higher rates, the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates,"" Maloney said.","Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year's midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who's footing the bill to power Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average — although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,” said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.

Rising electric costs aren’t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year's campaigns.

Higher electric bills on the horizon

Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.

With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, “it’s a life or death and ‘eat or heat’ type decision that people have to make,” said Charles Hua, PowerLines' founder.

In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of “rubber-stamping” rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.

Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.

Hubbard's message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see “more affordable pricing. That’s the main thing. It’s running my pocket right now.”

Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share — or share it with regular ratepayers.

Midterm battlegrounds in hotspots

Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots — or both — are fomenting community uprisings.

That includes California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.

That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.

Also playing a role is explosive demand from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising natural gas prices, analysts say.

“The cost of utility service is the new ‘cost of eggs’ concern for a lot of consumers,” said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.

In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.

Meanwhile, communities that don't want to live next to one are pushing back.

It's on voters' minds

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October found that electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

Now, as falls turns to winter, some states are warning that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown.

Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a “major” source of stress.

And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.

For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers — including data centers not even built yet.

Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.

That’s spurred governors from the region — including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection — to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.

High-rate states vs. lower-rate rates

Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, suggested that only some states are the drivers of higher average electric bills.

“If you set aside a few sates with higher rates, the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates,"" Maloney said.

Examples of states with faster-rising rates are California, where wildfires are driving grid upgrades, and those in New England, where natural gas is expensive because of strained pipeline capacity.

Still, other states are feeling a pinch.

In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state's for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying “we can’t take it anymore.”

Evolving Dimensions Between 2017 and 2020, there were 22 Japanese investments in India's semiconductor industry.","Recently, India and Japan have made significant progress in strengthening their Special Strategic and Global Partnership. A renewed focus on economic security is emerging, with an emphasis on critical sectors such as semiconductors, clean energy, critical minerals, information technology, and pharmaceuticals.

Japan has expanded its soft power diplomacy with India in advanced technology sectors, especially semiconductors. It plans to invest ¥10 trillion JPY ($68 billion USD) to enhance bilateral business ties with India over the next decade.

This initiative aims to target eight priority areas, including mobility, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, the environment, and healthcare. Additionally, these investments will enable Japanese companies to hire Indian specialists as part of their efforts to boost India's economy through closer business relationships.

What Is the New Proposition?

Japan is leading in manufacturing semiconductor machinery, including related materials, highlighting the country's commitment to manufacturing in India. The two governments established the India-Japan Dialogue on Economic Security, which has expanded into a comprehensive framework for cooperation in strategic trade and technology. It aims to address economic connections that have security implications and to strengthen resilience in key sectors. These include semiconductors, clean energy, pharmaceuticals, and information and communication technology.

In 2023, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of India and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry signed an agreement to cooperate in the field of semiconductors. These efforts led to specific projects. One is the Japanese semiconductor giant Renesas Electronics partnering with CG Power to establish an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facility in Gujarat. Another is the IIT Hyderabad and the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing through the Chips to Startup program collaboration. Finally, there is a strategic partnership between Tokyo Electron and Tata Electronics to bolster India's semiconductor ecosystem.

The Indian government has already allocated nearly INR 629 billion (approximately $7.17 billion). This is about 97% of the INR 650 billion (approximately US $7.41 billion) designated as incentives for semiconductor manufacturing under the India Semiconductor Mission. Additionally, Japan has extended yen loan support for Tamil Nadu's investment promotion program, which will fund startups in emerging technologies, including semiconductors.

Warming Ties

In August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Japan for the 15th India–Japan Annual Summit. The two-day visit resulted in several agreements and memoranda of understanding. One highlight was a visit to a semiconductor plant in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, which emphasized India's growing interest in strengthening technological ties with Japan.

The tour of Tokyo Electron Miyagi Ltd (TEL Miyagi), a key player in the semiconductor industry, showcased TEL's advanced manufacturing capabilities, its role in the global semiconductor supply chain, and its plans to expand collaborations with India. This reaffirmed both countries' commitment to strengthening their ties in the semiconductor sector. It further demonstrated the potential for collaboration in semiconductor fabrication, testing, and supply chain development.

The two leaders also emphasized their dedication to the India-Japan Semiconductor Supply Chain Partnership, aiming to strengthen both countries' roles in the global tech ecosystem. India, with its quickly growing tech industry, and Japan, a leader in semiconductor technology, are well-positioned to build resilient and secure supply chains.

Leveraging Japan's Technological Expertise and India's Talent Pool

Another significant milestone was the boost to India's semiconductor ambitions with the establishment of the Dholera Special Investment Region (SIR). A delegation of 20 Japanese semiconductor ecosystem support companies visited the site after SEMICON India 2025. Dholera has emphasized not only India's policy framework but also its on-ground execution and readiness to host advanced semiconductor infrastructure.

By leveraging Japan's technological expertise alongside India's scale and talent pool, and supported by Dholera's world-class smart city infrastructure, India is strengthening its emergence as a semiconductor hub. India's largest semiconductor fabrication facility, a joint venture of the Tata Group and Taiwan's PSMC, is already taking shape at this location. There is strong policy support in India, along with fiscal incentives aimed at attracting global players in chip manufacturing.

A Win-Win Situation

Japan holds a crucial role in the global semiconductor supply chain. It leads in chip-making equipment, specialty gases and materials, and advanced components. Japan supplies 50% of semiconductor materials and one-third of the global machinery. For India, partnering with Japan is essential to building a resilient and competitive semiconductor hub.

Japan offers unmatched precision and reliability, while India can provide scale and a vast market. Additionally, Tokyo plans to support hiring top talent in India, especially specialists in chips and technology. India has the world's largest population and a large pool of talented engineers.

According to one report, over the last five years, as many as 25,000 Indians with specialized skills have moved to Japan to join the workforce, pursue studies, or participate in training programs. Japan also aims to educate talent who can act as a bridge to help Japanese companies establish themselves in Indian markets. It anticipates a shortage of up to 790,000 workers trained in advanced technologies by 2030. In contrast, India produces about 1.5 million engineering graduates annually.

India has been heavily dependent on foreign countries for electronic manufacturing. For example, China accounts for one-third of India's semiconductor imports. The deal with Japan presents a vital opportunity to diversify the supply chain, with India implementing new policies to create a more resilient and self-reliant manufacturing sector, including advanced manufacturing.

Evolving Dimensions

Between 2017 and 2020, there were 22 Japanese investments in India's semiconductor industry. Then, from 2021 to 2024, this number increased to 58. The sector includes semiconductors, artificial intelligence, the space industry, and academic collaboration in quantum technology. This growth reflects a rising market potential in India and the alignment of both countries' foreign policies toward mutual goals, interests, and sensitivities.

India and Japan are progressing toward a mature partnership, marked by increased high-tech and academic collaboration. This reflects a global trend to build strong supply chains in advanced technology sectors, which should serve as a key driver of further economic growth for both nations, especially for India.

The evolving dimensions of Japanese soft power diplomacy are elevating this partnership, particularly in technology and innovation. And India must seize the opportunity amidst global instability.

We had neglected the squirrels that fall while deer hunting and the woods were full of them.
Mule deer are not like whitetail; they don’t always spook and disappear when encountered.
This hunt was memorable not only for missing but also the harvest of a really big mule deer.
Hunters should ensure they have a valid Texas hunting license, migratory game bird stamp, federal duck stamp, and HIP certification for the 2025-2026 season.","I was setting among a group of very veteran outdoorsmen at an event this past weekend and the subject of great shots made and missed while hunting through the years was brought up. Without exception each of us had our tales. Some, like my friend Larry Weishuhn, had stories to share from his years hunting across the globe in faraway places hunting big game animals I have only read about.

Larry related a hunt for mule deer when he was using a rifle and ammo with which he was very familiar and practiced with, making an 800-yard shot on a bedded Coues deer buck. Larry also stated that he doesn’t recommend taking such shots but he had practiced a great deal using quality Hornady ammo and felt comfortable he and his equipment were up to the extreme shot. His first shot hit just over the buck’s back and with a minor adjustment of the scope, the second shot was right on target.

Larry also recalled when he missed a big South Texas buck that came into his antler rattling. The deer was a scant 20 yards away. This is testament to how exciting antler rattling can be.

In Larry’s own words, “I just got RATTLED when he came charging out of the brush.”

My earliest recollection of a great shot was at a nuisance armadillo that was tearing up our front yard up when I was about nine. Armed with a little single shot J.C. Higgings .22 loaded with a short, my dad and I sneaked up on the armadillo, and the flashlight came on. The startled critter made a dash for the house, heading to an opening in the foundation. He was running wide open and I squeezed the trigger just as he reached the house. With a lucky shot, I dropped him as he was about to disappear under the house.

My dad made a big deal out of the lucky shot and told it around campfires for quite some time. I always loved to hear about me being an expert armadillo exterminator with that little rifle! The shot was a great confidence builder for a young hunter.

And then with that same little .22 I was aiming at a squirrel perched high in the branches of a very tall white oak. The wind was blowing and the branch the squirrel perched in was gently swaying back and forth. I timed my shot perfectly with the movement of the limb and made a perfect head shot on the bushytail. Looking back I was lucky to bag the squirrel at all, but, again, my confidence was bolstered and I was beginning to think I was a born sharpshooter.

After a lot more hunting and shooting I discovered luck and skill are two completely different things. I later had some expert rifle training thanks to Marine Corp. bootcamp and became a fair rifle shot.

But we all vividly remembered some of those difficult shots that will forever be etched in our memory banks as well as misses we should have made but didn’t. A couple years ago, I was hunting with another great friend Jeff Rice on his ranch in East Texas. Deer season was nearing the end and we both had plenty of venison in the freezer. I came up with the idea of procuring a few squirrels and making a cast iron skillet full of smothered squirrel rice and gravy. The problem was we had only our deer rifles, nary a shotgun or light rifle suitable for hunting squirrel. Then Jeff remembered his single action .22 revolver. We had neglected the squirrels that fall while deer hunting and the woods were full of them. There I learned how effective a good pistol shot can be with an iron-sighted revolver.

I was armed with a video camera and Jeff with his little revolver we entered the winter woods. I won’t say Jeff killed a squirrel every time he pulled the trigger but after about 45 minutes of banging away at bushytails, we had the making for a very fine squirrel dinner. There are easier things to hunt than a wary cat squirrel with a handgun in the winter when all the foliage is off the trees but, as they say, where there’s a will, there’s a way!

One of my favorite stories to tell around the campfire is about a desert mule deer hunt way out in the Trans Pecos country of West Texas. I had been invited to hunt a ranch that had a very good population of mule deer that were well managed and infrequently hunted. Mule deer are not like whitetail; they don’t always spook and disappear when encountered. I was shooting a muzzleloader and, to make a long story short, the wind had blown about half the seventy grains of powder away while I was loading at camp. This I didn’t discover until I leveled the rifle on the biggest mule deer of my career.

The percussion cap fired and rather than the loud KA-Boom that should have followed, the shot sounded more like a .22 rifle discharging. I immediately knew what I had done wrong, ducked behind a rock and reloaded, this time making sure all the powder went down the barrel. This epic miss was followed by a well-placed shot that dropped the big buck. This hunt was memorable not only for missing but also the harvest of a really big mule deer. Of course, while telling this story around the campfire, I seldom mention the part about missing -- after all, how could I have been successful with only a half charge of powder, right?

Duck hunting report

Texas duck hunting prospects are favorable, with recent rains improving habitat conditions and a good number of early-arriving teal reported, though overall duck populations are just average. Coastal marshes and rice fields in the east are expected to be productive due to improved aquatic vegetation, while inland water sources have become more appealing to ducks.

Hunters should ensure they have a valid Texas hunting license, migratory game bird stamp, federal duck stamp, and HIP certification for the 2025-2026 season.",http://www.ntxe-news.com/images/icons/fb_logo.gif,N,,2025-11-10 02:59:02.266759

The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Workplace Chemical Protection Program (WCPP) under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has fundamentally changed the compliance landscape for occupational exposures to certain chemicals.

For multiple high‑priority substances, the EPA has issued legally binding occupational exposure limits—Existing Chemical Exposure Limits (ECELs), and, in some cases, EPA Short‑Term Exposure Limits (EPA STELs)—that are significantly more stringent than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) long-standing Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and Short‑Term Exposure Limits (STELs).

Where a WCPP applies, owners and operators must ensure that exposures do not exceed the EPA's limits, even if they are far below OSHA's regulatory values. As a result, employers may be obligated to implement engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to achieve exposure levels well beneath OSHA's PELs/STELs.

Quick Hits

The EPA's Workplace Chemical Protection Program under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act has introduced stringent occupational exposure limits for certain chemicals that are significantly lower than OSHA's permissible exposure limits and short-term exposure limits. Employers must comply with the EPA's limits.

The WCPP framework includes comprehensive requirements, such as exposure monitoring, establishment of regulated areas, development of exposure control plans, and specific respiratory and dermal protection protocols. These requirements are codified in chemical-specific TSCA risk-management rules and operate in conjunction with OSHA standards.

Employers must identify applicable TSCA Section 6 risk management rules, compare EPA limits to current exposure data, and implement necessary controls and monitoring to comply with the stricter EPA standards. Failure to comply with the requirements can result in significant enforcement actions and penalties.

The Legal Architecture: TSCA Section 6 and the WCPP

Under TSCA Section 6, the EPA evaluates existing chemicals and, if an unreasonable risk is found, must promulgate risk management requirements. For several chemicals, the EPA has chosen to authorize ongoing industrial or commercial uses only under a WCPP—a comprehensive framework that includes:

ECELs (eight‑hour time‑weighted averages), and, where warranted, EPA STELs (fifteen‑minute TWAs);

initial, periodic, and additional exposure monitoring—based on personal breathing zone sampling and specified accuracy criteria;

the establishment and demarcation of regulated areas where ECEL/EPA STEL exceedances are likely or possible;

an Exposure Control Plan documenting the hierarchy of controls and demonstrating that feasible controls have been considered and implemented before reliance on personal protective equipment (PPE);

respiratory protection and dermal protection requirements aligned with OSHA programs, but sized to measured concentrations against EPA limits; and

training, notification, and recordkeeping obligations.

These WCPP requirements are codified in chemical‑specific TSCA risk-management rules. They do not supplant OSHA standards; they operate alongside them. Where the two regimes diverge, employers must comply with both—practically, that often means achieving the lower EPA limits while continuing to meet OSHA programmatic requirements (e.g., respiratory protection under 29 C.F.R. 1910.134, PPE under 29 C.F.R. 1910.132, hazard communication under 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200).

ECELs and EPA STELs Versus OSHA PELs: The Emerging Pattern

The EPA's recent TSCA risk-management rules demonstrate that ECELs and any EPA STELs can be an order of magnitude (or more) below OSHA's PELs/STELs. Illustrative examples are provided in the chart below.

Chemical OSHA PEL (8‑hr TWA) OSHA STEL EPA ECEL (8‑hr TWA) EPA STEL (15‑min TWA) Methylene chloride 25 ppm 125 ppm 2 ppm 16 ppm Perchloroethylene (PCE) 100 ppm 200 ppm 0.14 ppm N/A Carbon tetrachloride (CTC) 10 ppm N/A 0.03 ppm (0.2 mg/m³) N/A Trichloroethylene (TCE) 100 ppm 200 ppm 0.2 ppm (interim) N/A

The EPA's selection of ECELs/EPA STELs is grounded in current risk evaluations and is aimed at eliminating unreasonable risk to ""potentially exposed persons,"" a term broader than OSHA's ""employees."" In addition to workers, it encompasses volunteers, self‑employed persons, and some state and local government workers outside OSHA plan coverage. This broader scope helps explain why WCPP limits may be lower and why a facility in full compliance with OSHA could still have obligations to further reduce exposures under TSCA.

How the WCPP Imposes Obligations Below OSHA Limits

Even where OSHA PELs are higher, the WCPP makes the lower EPA values controlling for ongoing uses authorized under TSCA. In practice, this results in several concrete obligations:

Monitoring against EPA limits. Initial monitoring must establish a baseline relative to the ECEL and any EPA STEL using personal breathing zone sampling, specified accuracy tolerances, and a representative sampling design. Monitoring results at or above the ECEL ""action level"" (typically one‑half the ECEL) often trigger more frequent periodic monitoring and other ancillary controls—even though the action level is not itself an exposure limit.

Regulated areas keyed to EPA limits. Employers must establish and demarcate regulated area(s) wherever airborne concentrations exceed, or may reasonably be expected to exceed, the ECEL or EPA STEL. Access controls, signage (often multilingual), training, and PPE/respirator prerequisites must be enforced for entry.

The Exposure Control Plan and hierarchy of controls. Employers must develop and implement an Exposure Control Plan demonstrating consideration and implementation of feasible elimination, substitution, and engineering controls, followed by administrative/work practice controls. Reliance on PPE is permitted only after feasible higher‑tier controls are considered and implemented. The plan must be reviewed and updated, typically at least every five years, and be made available to potentially exposed persons.

Respiratory and dermal protection scaled to EPA limits. Where monitoring shows exposures above an ECEL or EPA STEL pending implementation of feasible controls, respiratory protection must be provided based on measured concentrations vis‑à‑vis EPA limits. For some chemicals (e.g., methylene chloride), only supplied‑air respirators are permitted due to cartridge service‑life concerns. Direct dermal contact controls and selected chemical‑resistant PPE (e.g., gloves with demonstrated resistance) may also be required.

Training, notification, and recordkeeping. Employers must notify potentially exposed persons of monitoring results, explain exceedances and corrective actions, and document training, exposure data, program implementation, and plan updates. Records are typically retained for five years (longer periods may also apply under OSHA).

These obligations apply regardless of OSHA compliance. For example, a methylene chloride user who reliably maintains exposures below OSHA's 25‑ppm PEL and 125‑ppm STEL may still be out of compliance under TSCA if exposures exceed the EPA ECEL of 2 ppm (8‑hr TWA) or the 16‑ppm EPA STEL (15‑minute TWA).

Dual Compliance and Enforcement Alignment

The EPA's WCPP rules expressly acknowledge that they do not supersede OSHA. Employers must comply with both. Notably:

OSHA remains the programmatic benchmark for respiratory protection and PPE programs, medical evaluations, fit testing, and training. WCPP rules generally align with 29 C.F.R. 1910.134 and 1910.132, but the trigger for PPE/respirators is the EPA's stricter ECEL/EPA STEL.

The EPA and OSHA have formalized coordination for Section 6 chemicals. Information sharing is intended to improve implementation and enforcement and to minimize gaps for worker populations not covered by OSHA.

As a practical matter, employers can expect EPA inspections and information requests keyed to WCPP elements and OSHA to consider the EPA's limits and findings in relevant contexts. Where the EPA discovers exceedances of ECELs/EPA STELs or deficiencies in Exposure Control Plans, regulated areas, or monitoring, TSCA's enforcement tools—including daily civil penalties—may apply.

Action Items for Employers

Employers might consider the following guideposts to better effectuate compliance:

Identifying whether any TSCA Section 6 risk-management rules with WCPP requirements apply to chemicals and conditions of use, including upstream processing and downstream use

Comparing EPA ECELs/EPA STELs to current exposure data, recognizing that compliance with OSHA PELs/STELs alone may be insufficient

Planning and executing initial monitoring in the manner and by the deadlines required, using personal breathing zone sampling and specified accuracy requirements, using the results to set periodic monitoring cadences

Establishing regulated areas and access controls based on EPA limits and ensuring entry prerequisites, signage, and multilingual communications are in place

Developing or updating Exposure Control Plans to document feasibility analyses and implementation across the hierarchy of controls, avoiding overreliance on PPE where feasible controls exist

Aligning respiratory and dermal PPE programs to measured concentrations against EPA limits while ensuring proper respirator type selection and training consistent with OSHA standards

Implementing training, notification, and five‑year recordkeeping protocols specific to WCPP requirements

The Bottom Line

The EPA's WCPP has ushered in a new era in occupational chemical risk management. For several high‑priority chemicals, compliance now turns on meeting the EPA's ECELs and EPA STELs—values that frequently sit well below OSHA's PELs and STELs. Employers that have long relied on OSHA compliance as the ceiling for exposure controls will likely want to reassess their programs. Where a WCPP applies, the controlling legal limit is the EPA's, and the obligation to evaluate and implement feasible controls to achieve those lower limits is immediate, detailed, and enforceable.

SIP was formed in early 2021 by the consolidation of two Sempra units — Sempra LNG and Infraestructura Energética Nova (aka IEnova).
Sempra Infrastructure Partners’ Assets","There’s been a lull in midstream M&A activity the past few months, but several companies in that space have been making significant adjustments to their portfolios, either by acquiring assets from others or selling ownership interests in their own businesses. There’s also been a lot of buzz about major deals that may be in the works. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss a few of the more interesting midstream transactions this fall and what’s spurring them, and also look at the general state of the midstream sector.

In July and then in September, we looked at the wide range of midstream deals that were consummated this past spring and summer. At least a couple of them were massive, including Brookfield Infrastructure Partners’ roughly $9 billion purchase of the Colonial Pipeline system, Western Midstream Partners’ $2 billion acquisition of produced water specialist Aris Water Systems, and Targa Resources’ $1.8 billion buy of the remaining 45% of what had been its 55/45 Badlands joint venture with units of Blackstone. We also examined the plan by WaterBridge (another produced water company) to go public via an initial public offering (IPO). (The IPO was successfully completed on September 17.)

Today, we’ll discuss another apples-and-oranges assortment of midstream deals, beginning with the late-September announcement by Sempra that it has reached an agreement to sell a 45% ownership interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners (SIP) to affiliates of private equity giant KKR & Co. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) for $10 billion in cash. The transaction, expected to close in either Q2 or Q3 2026, will leave Sempra with a 25% stake in SIP, which owns a number of existing and planned LNG export terminals and gas pipelines in the U.S. and Mexico, as well as several natural-gas-fired and renewable power facilities. (More on some of these in a moment.) The KKR/CPPIB consortium, in turn, will have a 65% stake (up from KKR’s current 20%) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) will have 10%.

In a statement, Sempra said the prospective sale is part of a broader initiative by the company “to simplify (its) business model, improve financial performance and reduce risk” by focusing primarily on its regulated utility businesses in California and Texas. The sale of a 45% stake in SIP, Sempra said, will move it toward the company’s goal of (1) getting 95% of its earnings from Sempra’s regulated utilities and (2) paying for its utilities’ 2025-29 capital spending plans without issuing more stock. In Texas, Sempra owns a roughly 80% stake in Oncor (the state’s largest electricity distribution utility) and a half-interest in Sharyland Holdings, a much smaller utility in South Texas. In California, Sempra owns San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas, a large gas distribution utility in Southern California.

SIP was formed in early 2021 by the consolidation of two Sempra units — Sempra LNG and Infraestructura Energética Nova (aka IEnova). A few months later, KKR took a 20% interest in SIP and a year after that ADIA took a 20% stake. SIP has assembled an impressive portfolio of midstream and power-generation assets, including full or partial ownership of several gas pipelines in Mexico, Texas and Louisiana (solid and dashed black lines in main map and inset maps in Figure 1 below); existing and planned LNG facilities (blue and blue-and-white boxes); and existing and planned solar facilities (green and green-and-white circles).

Democrat lawmakers are pushing for a one-year or longer extension of these enhanced subsidies to maintain affordability for millions of enrollees, while Republican lawmakers are proposing to redirect the hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies currently allocated to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) directly to American individuals and households instead.

This shift aims to cut out what President Doanld J Trump calls the “fat cat” insurance companies as middlemen in the subsidy process, which he describes as a corrupt system that props up “really bad Obamacare.”

Under the proposal, the money—previously paid as premium tax credits to insurers to reduce costs for enrollees—would go straight to consumers. People could then use these funds to purchase their own private health insurance policies on the open market, potentially selecting better and more affordable options than those mandated or available through ACA exchanges.

Specific mechanisms being discussed include depositing the subsidies into expanded Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or pre-funded federal flexible spending accounts. HSAs, typically paired with high-deductible health plans, allow tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses like doctor visits, prescriptions, or even insurance premiums.

The Trump admin would give individuals more direct control over their healthcare spending, bypassing insurers’ management of benefits and enabling shopping for coverage without relying on government-subsidized plans from large health insurance companies in the ACA.

The idea emerged amid government shutdown negotiations, where Democrats are demanding an extension of enhanced ACA tax credits (set to expire soon) in exchange for funding deals, while Republicans, encouraged by Trump, are pushing back to prioritize tax cuts, border security, and this redirection instead.

Proponents of the plan argue transparency, efficiency, and personal savings by empowering individuals to negotiate or choose alternatives like short-term plans or direct-pay arrangements with providers.

Critics, including Democrat lawmakers, warn (not a certainty) it could leave millions without adequate coverage, especially for pre-existing conditions, and disrupt the market without clear implementation details.

By the numbers

Research performed by the Lynnwood Times shows that the federal government has spent approximately $650 billion on ACA exchange subsidies (premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions) from 2014 (when ACA exchanges officially launched) through 2024.

The major health insurance companies have seen enormous financial gains from the ACA’s structure, with federal subsidies (including those expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act) amounting to $92 billion for ACA exchange subsidies (premium tax credits) in 2023 alone—much of it flowing to insurers. These major insurers cover approximately 31 million enrollees as of September 2024.

Below are the major publicly traded health insurers participating in the ACA exchanges, along with their stock price increases since the ACA was signed into law on March 23, 2010:

Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, outlined the government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments over the next five years in Canada.
The first five projects referred to the MPO in September collectively represent more than $60 billion in total capital investment.
Additional nation-building projects will be announced later this month and, taken together, this is expected to trigger at least $150 billion in total capital investment.
Budget 2025 launches bold pro-competitive measures to deliver lower prices, better service, and more choice for Canadians.","The world is increasingly dangerous and divided. Changes in the global trading system are causing massive disruptions and uncertainty for Canadians. In addition to that upheaval, business investment has been flat in Canada for a decade. This has caused productivity to grow by only 0.3% annually during that time – lagging behind the majority of our G7 partners. This has weighed on wages, job creation, and Canada’s prosperity.

Budget 2025: Canada Strong confronts these challenges head-on. This is Canada’s new government’s plan to mobilise investment and supercharge growth. We will harness our strengths to drive innovation and productivity – creating more high-paying careers, thriving businesses, and greater certainty for investors.

Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, outlined the government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments over the next five years in Canada. Through targeted tax incentives, major infrastructure projects, stronger competition, and a bold new approach to attracting talent, Budget 2025 sets the foundation for long-term prosperity, so we can build the strongest economy in the G7.

The government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments in five years includes the following measures:

Introducing a Productivity Super-Deduction to make it easier to do business and invest in Canada. Budget 2025 reinstates the Accelerated Investment Incentive and includes immediate expensing for manufacturing or processing machinery and equipment, clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment, and zero-emission technologies. It also moves forward with immediate expensing for productivity-enhancing assets and research capital expenditures for scientific research and experimental development, and introduces immediate expensing for new manufacturing or processing buildings and accelerated depreciation for low-carbon LNG facilities. Together, these measures form a Productivity Super-Deduction that will lower costs, spur private investment, and reduce Canada’s marginal effective tax rate to 13.2% – reinforcing Canada as the most tax-competitive country for new business investment in the G7.

Enhancing the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentives to help businesses innovate and grow. Budget 2025 moves forward with increasing the capital phase-out thresholds for the enhanced tax credit, extending the enhanced credit to eligible Canadian public corporations, and restoring the eligibility of capital expenditures. It also proposes increasing the annual expenditure limit on which the enhanced credit can be earned to $6 million.

Accelerating nation-building projects through the Major Projects Office (MPO) to supercharge growth across Canada. The new MPO serves as a single point of contact to fast-track transformative projects in energy, trade, transportation, and more. The first five projects referred to the MPO in September collectively represent more than $60 billion in total capital investment. Additional nation-building projects will be announced later this month and, taken together, this is expected to trigger at least $150 billion in total capital investment.

Launching the International Talent Attraction Strategy and Action Plan to make Canada a magnet for global talent. Budget 2025 invests $1.7 billion to recruit over 1,000 world-class researchers, attract top doctoral and post-doctoral fellows, and support universities in hiring internationally – positioning our immigration system to meet the needs of a modern, competitive economy.

Strengthening competition and consumer choice to lower costs and drive innovation. Budget 2025 launches bold pro-competitive measures to deliver lower prices, better service, and more choice for Canadians. It will boost telecom competition by cutting red tape, releasing new spectrum, and making it easier to switch providers. It will also advance open banking and modernise payments for Canadians through the forthcoming Real-Time Rail system. This, along with limits on non-compete clauses, will foster a fairer, more dynamic economy where Canadians pay less and get ahead.

Combined, these measures form a drastically different economic strategy to supercharge growth. Our plan focuses government spending where it delivers the highest return: in workers, businesses, and nation-building projects. This will drive lasting prosperity to help Canadians get ahead.

Epsilon Advanced Materials builds it into the foundation of its business.","In September, Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM) announced it is taking a major step toward strengthening the U.S. battery supply chain. Autocar Professional reported that the company announced an agreement with Phillips 66 to source green and calcined needle coke from the energy company’s refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Needle coke is a key feedstock used to manufacture synthetic graphite anodes, one of the most critical components in lithium-ion batteries.

The partnership gives Epsilon Advanced Materials reliable access to specialty coke materials through a supplier that ranks among the world’s leading producers. This collaboration aligns with the growing push to secure domestic production of battery materials, reduce reliance on overseas suppliers, and support the rapid expansion of electric vehicles and energy storage systems across the United States.

“This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,” said Vikram Handa, Managing Director of Epsilon Advanced Materials. He emphasized that the partnership combines Phillips 66’s expertise in energy and materials with EAM’s manufacturing capacity and global presence.

The needle coke supplied through this agreement will feed Epsilon’s new graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina. The plant is designed to produce 30,000 tons of graphite anode material annually when it begins operations in 2027. Epsilon intends to expand production to 60,000 tons by 2030. At full scale, the facility will supply enough anode material to power batteries for approximately one million electric vehicles every year. The material will support U.S. battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs as they ramp up domestic EV production.

Epsilon Advanced Materials was established in 2018 as part of the Epsilon Group and operates India’s first graphite anode material plant. The company focuses on sustainable and scalable battery materials, and is investing in new locations in North Carolina and Finland as part of a global growth strategy. The broader Epsilon Group, founded in 2010, includes companies focused on carbon black and battery materials and operates major production facilities in India.

This agreement signals how strategic partnerships can accelerate the development of a competitive U.S. supply chain for clean energy. By combining Phillips 66’s production capabilities with Epsilon’s battery-materials expertise, the two companies are positioning themselves at the center of North America’s shift toward sustainable transportation and energy storage.

Epsilon’s Strong Commitment to Sustainability

Most companies talk about sustainability. Epsilon Advanced Materials builds it into the foundation of its business.

Epsilon’s mission is simple: energize the world responsibly. The company designs and manufactures battery materials by rethinking how resources are sourced, processed, and reused. Instead of relying on traditional supply chains that generate significant waste, Epsilon focuses on circularity — turning industrial by-products into high-performance battery materials.

Localization plays a key role in this approach. Epsilon sources raw materials from nearby steel and industrial facilities, reducing transportation emissions and transforming what would otherwise be waste into something valuable. The result is a supply chain that is cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient.

Epsilon’s sustainability philosophy isn’t limited to environmental considerations. The company operates with a strong ESG framework that includes economic and social impact. Through community programs focused on health, education, gender equality, clean energy, and environmental restoration, Epsilon has improved the lives of more than 300,000 people across 50 villages in India. The company funds local infrastructure, supports clean water initiatives, and promotes sports and educational access — proving that industrial growth and community development can go hand in hand.

Epsilon believes that energy transition should benefit both people and the planet. By minimizing waste, maximizing resource efficiency, and investing directly into the communities where it operates, the company is shaping a new model for sustainable manufacturing. As global demand for battery materials grows, Epsilon’s circular, local-first strategy shows that scaling clean energy doesn’t have to come at the cost of environmental or social responsibility.

The future of electrification requires more than supply. It requires purpose. Epsilon is powering both.",https://evinfo.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-icon-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:29.752867

The story of China's clean tech exports is not one of dominance, but of interdependence and shared progress.
China's clean tech exports are more than trade flows; they are also a bridge between economies, technologies and environmental responsibility.","In a world racing to curb climate change, one country's industrial drive has become a cornerstone of the global energy transition.

In the first seven months of this year, China's exports of electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries — the essential pillars of the new energy economy — surged to $120 billion, including a record $20 billion in August alone, according to data from Ember, an energy think tank based in the United Kingdom.

By comparison, the United States' fossil fuel exports stood at around $80 billion in the first eight months of 2025.

While this is often framed as a geopolitical ""win"" for China and a ""loss"" for the West, this perspective misses the bigger, more optimistic picture.

This is far more than an economic milestone. It reflects how China's clean technology sector is helping to decarbonize the global economy, making sustainable energy solutions more affordable, accessible and scalable than ever before.

Perhaps the most profound impact of China's clean tech expansion has been the dramatic fall in renewable energy costs.

Over the past decade, solar panel prices have dropped over 80 percent, driven largely by Chinese manufacturing efficiency, innovation and economies of scale.

For many developing nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America, this cost revolution is transformative. Renewable energy — once a distant aspiration — is now the most economically viable path to sustainable growth. It allows countries to leapfrog outdated fossil-fuel systems and move directly to modern, low-carbon energy grids built on solar power, wind power and energy storage.

In this way, China's exports are democratizing clean energy access, enabling a green leap for emerging economies. Affordable solar panels and batteries are helping communities gain energy independence while advancing both climate resilience and inclusive development.

Meeting global climate targets depends not only on innovation but also on mass deployment — and that is where China's role is indispensable. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement on climate change require a transformation of the world's energy systems at a scale and speed never attempted before.

China's unparalleled manufacturing capacity is the engine powering this transformation. Every solar module, battery pack and electric vehicle exported and installed or used abroad contributes to the displacement of fossil fuels, preventing millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes.

By making clean technology cheaper than fossil alternatives, China has effectively aligned economic logic with environmental necessity — a crucial shift for achieving global net-zero goals. The results speak for themselves. In 2024, a record 92.5 percent of all newly installed power capacity worldwide came from renewable sources, with solar and wind power leading the surge. Clean energy now accounts for over 40 percent of global electricity generation, according to ""Renewable Capacity Statistics 2025"", a report released by the International Renewable Energy Agency in March.

A January report by Bloomberg-NEF noted that China remains the driving force behind this shift, having invested $818 billion in clean energy in 2024 — nearly two-thirds of global growth in the sector.

With national goals of adding 1,200 gigawatts of solar and wind power by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral before 2060, China's domestic transition is redefining not only its economy but also the trajectory of the global energy landscape, as cited in a report in India-based Saur Energy International magazine.

The expansion of clean tech industries has also redefined the nature of global cooperation. As demand for renewable technologies grows, new supply chains are forming — more diverse, interconnected and resilient.

Concepts like ""friend-shoring"" are not about isolation but about shared responsibility and interdependence. China's position as a manufacturing and innovation hub strengthens this network, providing the scale and reliability that underpin global supply stability.

At the same time, this dynamic encourages healthy competition and rapid innovation. While China's factories deliver current generation technologies at scale, the country is also investing heavily in next-generation research and development — from advanced batteries and green hydrogen to smart grids and digitalized energy systems.

Crucially, these efforts are not confined to within China's borders. Through joint ventures, technology transfer and overseas investment, Chinese companies are helping partner nations build their own green industrial bases. This fosters local employment, skills development and industrial diversification, ensuring that the benefits of the green transition are shared more equitably.

The story of China's clean tech exports is not one of dominance, but of interdependence and shared progress. The true beneficiary of this transformation is the planet itself, as clean, affordable technology becomes the global standard.

China's leadership in scaling and exporting renewable technologies demonstrates its growing role as a responsible global stakeholder, one using its industrial strength and innovation capacity to tackle one of humanity's greatest challenges.

Yet the next phase of the green transition must be deeply collaborative. To sustain momentum and ensure balanced growth, all regions — from Central Asia and Africa to Europe and Latin America — should work toward coordinated investment frameworks to scale green infrastructure and attract private capital; open technology ecosystems that promote transparent standards, fair competition and shared innovation; build regional manufacturing and training hubs that create human capital and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities; and ensure stronger international policy dialogue to align industrial, climate and trade agendas.

By strengthening collaboration rather than competition, the world can turn China's industrial success into a global sustainability success story — where technology, policy and partnership combine to accelerate decarbonization and economic inclusion alike.

China's clean tech exports are more than trade flows; they are also a bridge between economies, technologies and environmental responsibility. They show how one nation's industrial capacity can empower many others to achieve their climate goals more quickly and affordably.

As nations collectively strive toward carbon neutrality, cooperation — not fragmentation — will define success. Through sustained openness, innovation and mutual trust, China and its partners can help shape a future that is not only green, but also inclusive, resilient and shared by all.

The proposed First Energy gas plant has a capacity of 1,200 MW.
The math: 1200 MW (plant capacity) X $559,000 (delta in CP vs CC) = $671 million more for a new coal plant compared to a natural gas plant.
Market Reality At typical capacity factors (gas CC 78%, new coal 25%), PJM estimates the LCOE for a new combined-cycle gas plant around $46/MWh, compared with $378/MWh for a new coal unit.
If the so-called “Make Electricity More Expensive Act” passes, that new First Energy gas plant could be forced to sit idle so older, less efficient coal units can run instead.","First Energy last week announced plans to build a new natural gas–fired power plant at a yet-to-be-determined location in West Virginia. Newsman Mike Nolting filed a complete story.

That decision comes despite a legislative push – led by state senators Brian Helton, Rollan Roberts, and Chris Rose – to force coal-fired power plants in the state to run at least 69% of the time, regardless of market economics. Under that proposal, companies that don’t comply could lose the ability to file rate cases for cost recovery, not just for generation but potentially for transmission and distribution as well.

So Why Gas, Not Coal?

If coal-fired electricity truly drove down power bills, why wouldn’t First Energy simply build a coal plant? Either way, the company expands its rate base and earns a return on the investment. The cost of fuel itself – coal or gas – is a pass-through; utilities don’t make money on it.

So again, why not coal? Certainly, First Energy doesn’t need state senators on its back. Because it’s not in customers’ best interest, and FirstEnergy knows it.

The Economics Don’t Lie

Utilities can’t just build plants on a whim. They must prove to regulators, like the Public Service Commission, that the investment makes economic sense. One of the main tools used is the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)—essentially a long-term economic test of whether a project pencils out.

According to analysis of the 2024 State of the Market Report from PJM’s independent market monitor, Monitoring Analytics, LLC, the 20-year annualized cost for a new plant is roughly:

Combined-Cycle Gas (CC): $184,198 per MW-year

Combustion Turbine Gas (CT): $185,198 per MW-year

Coal Steam Plant (CP): $742,650 per MW-year

That means a new 1 MW gas plant needs about $184,000 per year to cover fixed costs, while a comparable coal unit would need $743,000 per year – four times as much. The proposed First Energy gas plant has a capacity of 1,200 MW. The math: 1200 MW (plant capacity) X $559,000 (delta in CP vs CC) = $671 million more for a new coal plant compared to a natural gas plant.

Those costs flow straight to ratepayers.

Key Question: Would you rather pay $671 million a year more in order to use coal instead of gas at a single plant? Of course not. You only care that the lights come on when you flip the switch.

Market Reality

At typical capacity factors (gas CC 78%, new coal 25%), PJM estimates the LCOE for a new combined-cycle gas plant around $46/MWh, compared with $378/MWh for a new coal unit.

PJM’s average wholesale energy price in 2024 was only $33–34/MWh. A coal plant that needs $378/MWh to break even has no chance of recovering its costs. A gas plant at $46/MWh is at least in the ballpark – and can supplement revenue with capacity and ancillary-service payments.

That’s why no rational investor builds coal anymore. The last new coal-fired power plant in the United States came online in 2013 – in Texas.

What the Market Is Telling Us

PJM’s generation mix makes the point clearer. In 2024, natural gas produced 44.3% of PJM’s electricity – the highest share ever – while coal fell to 14.5%, its lowest on record. In 2008, those numbers were reversed: coal 55%, gas 7%.

Coal generation barely rose 1.4% last year; gas rose 3.5%. PJM’s monitor identified 34.7 GW of capacity at risk of retirement by 2030 – most of it coal, with 13.3 GW expected to retire strictly for economic reasons.

The trend isn’t ideology. It’s arithmetic.

Politics vs. Economics

Lawmakers clinging to the past will talk about jobs, blame renewables (whose share remains small), invoke China, or slap the “liberal” label on anyone citing numbers. But markets don’t care about slogans. They don’t care about picking one commodity over another for arbitrary reasons. They respond to cost, efficiency, and return on investment.

Reality? This is business, not politics. It’s economics, not ideology.

If the so-called “Make Electricity More Expensive Act” passes, that new First Energy gas plant could be forced to sit idle so older, less efficient coal units can run instead.

Who pays for that distortion – the higher costs of running the less efficient plant?

Not PJM. Not the utilities. You do. Are you ok with that?",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 21:01:12.798141

However, climate finance has lagged, global emissions continue to rise, and the gap between pledges and practice has only widened since.

Against the backdrop of record-breaking heat, intensifying climate consequences, and a mounting public frustration with global inaction, the 30th Conference of Parties (COP30) of the UNFCCC begins at Belém in Brazil today.

It is both symbolic and strategic that COP30 is being hosted in Belém, which is a point of entry to the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon is one of the world’s largest and most important carbon sinks (estimated at 150-200 billion tonnes) and biodiversity reserves on the planet — and it is threatened by deforestation and land conversion to non-forest use. As a result, it is tipping towards irreversible decline.

Equity and inclusion are central to climate negotiations. But paradoxically, even before the negotiations began, COP30 faced an unexpected test: inclusion. This is because Belém has limited logistical options, leaving hotel room rates to skyrocket and rendering it difficult for representatives from low-income nations and civil society organisations to participate. Such logistical exclusions have, in some ways, undercut the moral weight of the process.

‘Implementation COP’

For starters, COP30 is being called the ‘Implementation COP’ because it is expected to be a watershed event where commitments are expected to be translated into concrete action. Guided by the Global Stocktake (GST) — which is a mandatory review that countries have to undertake every five years to assess their progress on addressing climate change, identify gaps, and draft plans — COP30 is expected to advance mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation.

Its programme will thus focus on six key areas, including energy, industry, and transport transitions; stewardship of forests, oceans, and biodiversity; transformation of food systems; resilience in cities, infrastructure, and water; and human and social development.

The Baku-to-Belém Roadmap on Climate Finance is a plan led by the COP presidency, developed by Azerbaijan and Brazil under the UNFCCC’s guidance, to show how countries and institutions could scale finance for developing nations to at least $1.3 trillion a year by 2035. It’s less a binding pledge and more a menu of actions to inform negotiations after the $300-billion New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) decision at COP29. Now, as the first major stocktake after the Roadmap, participants are looking at COP30 to set a new collective goal for 2035. In addition to revisiting emission reduction and climate finance goals, it’s also expected to reaffirm the fact that protecting forests and indigenous communities is central to global climate resilience.

Ultimately, COP30 will seek to mobilise all actors to accelerate climate action.

Adaptation in negotiations

Climate adaptation is imperative for the survival of millions of people in the Global South. But because adaptation is context-specific, what works in a coastal delta is unlikely to work in a mountain village. As a result, negotiations surrounding the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) have been difficult. The GGA aims to establish quantifiable goals and metrics for resilience, organise funding that matches the need, and create a system for accounting and quantifying adaptation outcomes. This long-delayed framework is expected to be established at COP30.

As discussions progress, experts around the world emphasise the need to consider local and indigenous knowledge systems in this process. Across India, for example, traditional seed varieties, water-harvesting structures, and community-based ecosystem restoration efforts offer proven models of resilience.

Finance: the missing piece

Under the Paris Agreement, economically developed countries pledged $100 billion per year to finance climate action in developing nations. At COP29, a breakthrough agreement called the NCQG on Climate Finance was reached. This target is expected to triple climate finance from $100 billion to $300 billion annually by 2035 and scale up finance from all actors, both public and private, to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.

However, it should be noted that the $300 billion is significantly less than the estimated trillions of dollars needed by economically developing countries, with the latter arguing that the use of ‘all actors’ to scale up finance has diluted the common but differentiated responsibilities principle, which also includes historical emissions. ‘All actors’ means every potential source of climate finance, not just developed-country governments. It lumps together public treasuries, multilateral development banks, private investors, philanthropies, sub-national authorities, and even developing countries’ own private sectors.

The Loss and Damage Fund, set up in COP28, is also grossly underfunded, receiving less than a billion dollars against an annual need running into hundreds of billions of dollars. For developing countries, this finance is an enabler of ambition, enhancing preparedness for extreme climate events, expanding climate-resilient agriculture, and accelerating the adoption of renewable energy.

COP30 is expected to finalise the reporting requirements and financing arrangements under the NCQG. One looming question at Belém is: will a credible pathway emerge for moving from the $300 billion to the $1.3 trillion target and build confidence in developing countries? And will Belém also finalise the modalities of finance: who will pay, who will gain, and how it will be accounted for?

Transition and ambition

Transitions must be fair as economies move towards net zero (i.e. that humans add no net greenhouse gases to the atmosphere over a period; emissions are reduced almost to zero, and any residual sources are balanced by removals, e.g. restoring forests and carbon capture) — and transformation can’t be fuelled solely by finance. Access to reasonably priced technology and capacity building are equally important for many developing countries, be it efficient water systems, resilient crops, or clean energy, which are frequently hindered by high costs or intellectual property issues.

Beyond promises, COP30 should lead to North-South collaborations for training, innovation, and technology sharing. Otherwise, climate transition runs the risk of becoming yet another area of inequality. In countries like India, investments in low-carbon manufacturing, renewable energy, ecosystem restoration, green skills development, small businesses, and alternative livelihoods must all be part of a ‘just transition’.

Countries were expected to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through 2035 and submit them by February 2025. However, according to Climate Action Tracker, many countries are yet to submit their reports. The ones submitted so far account for only 19% of global emissions.

Negotiations at COP30 are expected to address the insufficient ambition of climate targets and reveal whether countries are prepared to put aside rhetoric and match science and ambition, a significant challenge in the absence of climate finance.

Climate-nature nexus

A key spotlight of Belém is the long-overdue integration of climate and biodiversity agendas. Brazil is pushing for an innovative financing model for conservation, known as the ‘Tropical Forest Forever Facility’. The proposal aims to compensate more than 70 developing countries with tropical forests for their efforts to preserve them.

This growing recognition that climate and biodiversity crises are interlinked could make climate finance more effective, directing funds to ecosystem restoration, agroforestry, and community-led conservation.

India at COP30

At Belém, India will be championing climate justice and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, urging developed nations to take the lead in emission cuts and financial support. In fact, at the mid-year climate talks in Bonn, India played a pivotal role in coordinating the G77+China bloc of developing countries to advocate for a fair and predictable finance goal under the NCQG framework.

This positioning reinforces India’s role as both a responsible power and a representative of broader southern concerns while serving as a bridge between the Global North and South.

However, while India’s domestic targets are ambitious, efforts in the institutional landscape remain a work in progress, as reflected in initiatives such as green budgeting, sovereign green bonds, and the proposed national carbon market expected by 2026. This gap must be viewed in the context of India’s developmental realities, which continue to shape its climate choices and actions.

The stakes could not be higher at COP30. The Amazon setting underscores the urgency of protecting the world’s ecosystems while tackling emissions. For India, it is a moment to shape the conversation, striking a balance between domestic imperatives and global responsibilities. What unfolds in Belém will go a long way towards determining whether the international community can still bend the curve of emissions and whether emerging economies, such as India, can secure the space and support they need for economic growth that is resilient to climate change.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/mqge4v/article70259125.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/COP30_Climate_Summit_91947.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 21:01:16.522356

Quick facts

Canada's economy is now 34% less carbon-intensive than it was in 2005 thanks to energy efficiency improvements, decarbonisation of the electricity grid, and structural shifts in the economy.

Canada has decoupled economic growth from emissions. From 2005 to 2023, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 8.5%, while gross domestic product grew by 38%.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like the wildfires burning throughout Canada this summer as well as drought, floods and more severe storms.

Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5-6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. 2024 was the most destructive season in Canadian history for insured losses from severe weather. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy provides a chance to retool and reinvest in building Canada strong and sustainable, working closely with provinces, territories and Indigenous partners by focusing on shared economic and climate goals.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy complements and does not replace the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan and other actions we will continue to take under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act.

The strategy outlines whole-of-government action to mobilise public and private sector capital. This includes finalising investment tax credits, launching sustainable investment guidelines, and continuing to offer Carbon Contracts for Difference through the Canada Growth Fund to de-risk investments.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy aligns with and advances the work on accelerating major nation-building projects, to enable clean growth, address climate change, and strengthen Canada's industries.

There is a photograph, taken ten years ago in Paris, that today seems like something of a relic.

In it, dozens of men and women line up in dark suits, in front of an enormous sign that reads COP21 Paris.

Right in the middle the UK's then-Prime Minister, David Cameron, grins widely, as he stands beside the future King Charles III, just in front of China’s Xi Jinping. Far off to the right is the then US President Barack Obama, deep in conversation with someone who is cut off from the frame - because there were so many leaders lining up that day that it was difficult for the photographer to capture them all at once.

What a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil, with just 30 leaders in the picture.

Xi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump.

In fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year.

Which raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there?

Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was ""not fit for purpose.""

""The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,"" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom.

""Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,"" he tells me.

So, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference?

Trump and the climate 'con job'

On his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

""This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,"" he told the UN General Assembly in September. ""If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.""

He has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction.

Plus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their ""pathetic"" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons.

The objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the ""number one energy superpower in the world"".

Meanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda.

Subsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too.

""Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?"" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies.""

John Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. ""The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,"" he argues.

“They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th.""

Last month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks.

Many supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments?

Anna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as ""taking place in a really difficult political context"" given Trump's position.

""I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.”

It’s too late to win at table tennis

Trump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology.

In 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief. After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy.

And, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global.

The split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth.

And it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle.

Speaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.”

The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China.

She called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals ""a cautionary tale we must not forget"".

The European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that.

But that ambition may come too late.

""China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,"" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now ""virtually unassailable”.

He likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: ""If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope.""

China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices.

The EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met.

Restricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, ""If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort.""

COP: New purpose or pointless?

Now, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for ""holding to account"" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an ""important role”.

The gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents ""deadly negligence"" on the part of the world community.

Last year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering.

""I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,"" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up.

""You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments. You need time for industries to develop and for things to happen. You need the real economy to catch up.""

He believes it would be much more productive for the discussions to happen in smaller meetings focused on removing barriers to clean energy.

But he also believes that some issues, like implementation, need to be discussed in places he deems more relevant - like on Wall Street ""where people can actually fund stuff” - as opposed to on the edge of the Brazilian rainforest.

Even so, this will be important negotiations at this year's COP. Among other things, it aims to get an agreement for a multi-billion-dollar fund to support the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.

The UK's Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband believes these meetings have delivered real progress by getting countries to engage with tackling climate change and enact policies that have made the renewable revolution possible.

""It's dry, it's complicated, it's anguished, it's tiring,” he says - “and it's absolutely necessary”.

Many now do, however, accept there is a strong argument for these international gatherings to be scaled down.

Ultimately, however, the real choice underlying it, for so many nations in attendance, simply comes down to the extent to which they align with a China-led clean energy revolution - or double down on the fossil fuels–first agenda.

Which is why many observers say the process of decarbonisation is going to be less about the multi-country commitments of COPs past, and far more about big-money deals between individual countries as we look ahead to this year’s summit - and how COPs may well play out in the future.

It is a is a clean energy hub.
Hogan said that while those emissions caps were removed, there would continue to be an industrial price on carbon emissions.
It’ll be important to invest in carbon capture and sequestration if we’re not going to proceed with that cap on oil and gas emissions.
“Does this mean oil and gas emissions will go up.","Calgary’s energy producing firms got some good news from the Government of Canada’s Budget 2025 during an event at UCalgary on Nov. 9.

Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience Elanor Olszewski, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Corey Hogan outlined how the government’s budget would put an end to emissions caps, provide increased clarity on industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and provide tax credits for the clean economy.

“With this plan, we’re strengthening carbon pricing as well as methane regulations, and those really are the most effective tools we have at this point in time to cut emissions while keeping Canadian industry competitive, and by that we mean on the world stage,” said Minister Olszewski.

“I think these new budgetary measures will ensure that Calgary continues to lead the way in building Canada’s clean energy future.”

She said that would come with partnerships with the provinces, local governments, and Indigenous groups.

“The Prime Minister and my cabinet colleagues are working with Alberta officials on transformative projects like Pathways, which will really position us as a global energy leader in the future. We are also trying to create certainty for investors, predictability, better market access for Alberta’s world class experts, so that we can ensure that clean growth means good jobs and shared prosperity,” said Minister Olszewski.

Hogan said the introduction of new incentive tax credits (ITCs) would build on the investments that have already been made by the Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund into clean tech hubs within Calgary.

“The entire purpose of the ITCs is to generate the kind of capital and innovation that we know is going to be needed to make Canada that global leader that we’re talking about. We know that Calgary is not just a conventional energy hub. It is a is a clean energy hub. It is an energy hub full stop, and it’s part of why we lead the world across the entire spectrum of energy technologies,” he said.

Investment in clean tech were essential because other nations are also competing in that space, said Hogan.

“We’re seeing capital is moving into that space very aggressively. You’re seeing the clean technologies get the investments over the conventional technologies—both significant drivers of investment, both important, but this is where the world is going, and we need to secure both,” he said.

“But we’re not the only ones who realize this. Nations around the world are racing to build clean industries that will power the future in energy, manufacturing, critical minerals and technology. The clean technology market is set to triple by 2035. This transformation is reshaping trade.”

Budget 2025 supported by Chamber, major local firms

In a statement sent by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Budget 2025, they said that moves by the federal government to remove an emissions cap was something they were pleased with.

Hogan said that while those emissions caps were removed, there would continue to be an industrial price on carbon emissions.

“It will be important to to reduce our methane emissions. It’ll be important to invest in carbon capture and sequestration if we’re not going to proceed with that cap on oil and gas emissions. But the good news is, those are things that we’ve all said that we want to do. That’s things that provincial government said we want to do. That’s things that industry said that they want to do,” he said.

“So it suddenly becomes a question of let’s just make sure that we’re all have the same understanding, the same comprehension as to what that means. We’re not going to get to a situation where that means one thing to one thing to one party, one to the other.”

Minister Olszewski said collaboration would be the key to moving Canada’s and Calgary’s economy forward.

“The fact that the federal government is working together with premiers, with other business leaders, with other groups, to make sure that what we do reflects a consensus between those parties. I just think that’s fundamentally important,” she said.

Hogan said one of the rationales for removing the emissions cap was that the planet doesn’t really care where the emissions come from it was just important to reduce them—and that meant ensuring that the market could find solutions to that problem.

“Does this mean oil and gas emissions will go up. I don’t know? What we’ve seen is that oil and gas, of course, has managed to reduce emissions intensity over time. We’ve also seen that Canadian oil and gas, which is produced in an environmentally sensitive, socially sensitive way, has found markets across the world,” he said.

“If the market decides that ultimately you can reduce emissions elsewhere in Canada, and Canadians are better off with the emissions from oil and gas being lower in the order, that’s great. I don’t think any of us should have a problem with that, because our concern should be how do we reduce emissions? Not where do those reductions come from.”",https://i0.wp.com/livewirecalgary.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251109-Budget-2025-Announcement-AT-0029-copy.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-09 19:58:35.000898

Year to date, American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for existing and future export plants for a total of 29.5 million metric tons per year, according to data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group cited by Reuters.

The volume of newly contracted U.S. LNG more than quadrupled between January and October compared to the 7 million metric tons per year (mtpa) contracted for the whole of 2024.

The U.S. LNG industry is now on track to have signed the second-highest export volumes on record, trailing only 2022, when buyers in Europe turned en masse to American gas as Russian pipeline supply to Europe slumped and stopped for many EU markets, including Germany.

Encouraged by the Trump Administration’s energy policy, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. In July, Venture Global took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG, together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. Top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. NextDecade has decided to invest $6.7 billion in the expansion of its Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas, in the second Rio Grande expansion announced this year, while Sempra approved a $14 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion.

U.S. developers of six export projects have made FIDs and secured financing so far this year, bringing total global LNG finance to a record of $72 billion, energy commodity shipping broker and advisor Poten & Partners said last month.

“Six US FIDs in one year is unprecedented– the highest number before this year was three US projects. The liquefaction finance tally could continue to climb in the final quarter of this year as a few more projects – also in the US – appear to be nearing FID,” Poten & Partners said.

In the near term, the U.S. is set to add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 alone, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the Energy Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook in October. Additions to LNG export capacity are set to boost total U.S. LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d in 2025 and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024, according to the EIA estimates.

The surge in U.S. LNG exports and the expected jump in Qatari LNG shipments once Qatar’s mega expansion projects are completed in 2027 have stoked fears of a coming LNG glut that could depress prices.

U.S. developers appear unfazed by this prospect and are even raising their liquefaction fees as project costs soar amid persistent higher financing rates, labor shortages, and an increase in prices of materials.

In March this year, most U.S. liquefaction fees were being discussed at $2.65 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.95 per MMBtu, “as EPC cost escalations show no sign of abating,” Poten & Partners said at the time.

“Higher raw material prices, which are seeing further escalation because of tariffs, coupled with rising labor and financing costs are having a pronounced impact on US LNG liquefaction project implementation. The cost increases make it challenging for developers to keep engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts valid as they try to move ahead with their LNG export projects,” the broker and advisor said.

Now U.S. LNG exporters and developers are asking about 15% higher liquefaction fees compared to the 2023 average of about $2 per MMBtu, Poten & Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer told Reuters this week.

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts. Buyers are still willing to pay higher liquefaction fees to secure American LNG, which is seen in Europe as a means to cut off Russian supply by 2027 and in Asia as a lever to pull in tariff and trade deal talks with the Trump Administration.

A $94 million award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will allow the port to cut carbon emissions by transitioning from gas and diesel equipment to electric equipment.

“It’s a huge investment in our infrastructure that allows us to both grow our economic impact, and also be really great for air quality and decarbonization,” Epstein said.

Construction is underway at the port, with renovations expected to be completed within the next 18 months.

Qcells, a unit of South Korea's Hanwha Solutions, said Friday that it will also lay off 300 workers from staffing agencies at its plants in Dalton and Cartersville, both northwest of Atlanta.

The company says U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been detaining imported components at ports on suspicion that they contain materials that may have been made with forced labor in China, meaning it can't run its solar panel assembly lines at full strength.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in August that her department was stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a 2021 law that restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. Published reports indicate that U.S. officials began detaining solar cells made by Qcells in June. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection couldn't immediately answer questions about Qcells on Friday.

Qcells says none of its materials or components are made with forced labor or even come from China. Spokesperson Marta Stoepker said the company maintains “robust supply chain due diligence measures” and “very detailed documentation,” which has been successful in getting some shipments released.

“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said.

She said Qcells is continuing to cooperate and expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months.

“Although our supply chain operations are beginning to normalize, today we shared with our employees that HR actions must be taken to improve operational efficiency until production capacity returns to normal levels,"" Stoepker said in a statement.

Qcells has said it pays workers an average of about $53,000 a year. Workers will retain full benefits during furloughs.

Qcells is completing a $2.3 billion plant in Cartersville to make ingots, wafers and solar cells — the building blocks of finished solar modules. The company has said it will finish the plant even though President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress dismantled most of the tax credits for buying solar panels earlier this year.

Europe’s gas sector is facing a new horizon that will enable better energy security","An essential component for the energy sector is to efficiently track the methane emissions from the energy industry, and the EU has some of the strictest rules and regulations for any imports of gas into the region. However, while we commend the regulations aimed at reducing harmful emissions, the United States and other nations have lamented the EU’s emission regulations, noting that it has complicated the trade of essential energy resources. With several market insiders urging the EU to reconsider its emission regulations, the sector is facing a troubling time in Europe.

European buyers and US suppliers are in agreement over the EU’s strict rules

The overarching consensus among the litany of European buyers and the myriad of US gas suppliers is that the EU’s emission regulations for methane have become too strict and are placing complications on the trade of gas and LNG.

With a Swiss energy trader, Axpo, noting that it was in advanced negotiations with a US supplier of gas, but that the deal has been put on hold for the time being, as the US supplier simply can not meet the EU’s emission regulations.

The EU’s regulations for methane emissions require EU importers to report information about the methane emissions of imported gas. That does not align with the United States regulations and has complicated a vast amount of long-term deals in the pipeline. The EU’s regulation requires the information to be submitted no later than May 2029 and cover imports from supply contracts concluded or renewed after 4 August 2024.

“Signing supply deals of that scale without knowing whether they will comply with the EU regulation is a big risk.” – Axpo head of trading Domenico de Luca

Both the United States and Qatar are urging the EU to amend its methane regulations

The United States is the largest producer of gas energy in the world, and the US gas sector is urging the EU to rethink its methane regulations for imports. Noting that the current regulations complicate things, as buyers can not commit to long-term contracts, and suppliers in the United States can not meet the stringent emission regulations laid out by the EU.

“We are in a difficult situation. Europe has few options if it doesn’t want to go back to Russian LNG.” – Axpo head of trading Domenico de Luca

The new wave of sanctions imposed on Russian energy in all its forms has further complicated the situation, as the world prepares for a future without Russian energy resources. The EU’s tight restrictions on methane emissions are a step in the right direction, but may need some easing of regulations while the world conemplates the future of the international energy market.

The result of the sanction has led to tighter prices for diesel and jet fuel as well, pointing to the fact that the sanction may have far-reaching implications that were not carefully considered by the international energy sector. Qatar has also released a joint statement with the US, urging the EU to rethink its emission regulations.

A modern industry policy must do better.
In this context, the national resilience pivot is not just an economic issue but a strategic one.
This means applying clear, transparent metrics for sovereignty dividends, which are the quantifiable returns in resilience, capability and regional value creation.
For too long, Australian industry policy has oscillated between two extremes: uncritical market faith and over-engineered state intervention.","Australia stands at a crossroads where ambition, fiscal restraint and strategic necessity intersect. The Future Made in Australia agenda, once a rallying cry for sovereign capability and clean-energy transformation, is now the test case for whether we can build genuine national resilience without repeating the waste and distortion of past subsidy cycles. To succeed, Canberra must shift its focus from chasing announcements to engineering durable capability.

The 2026–27 federal budget will be the crucible for this test. Globally, industry policy spending has exploded: the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act has already mobilised US$369 billion (about $567 billion) in tax credits across power, industry and transport, while the European Union’s 025 Clean Industrial Deal and new state-aid rules give members wider levers to back clean-tech manufacturing, rather than a fixed euro envelope. Closer to home, Japan and Korea have each earmarked more than US$200 billion (about $300 billion) for semiconductor and battery competitiveness. Against that tide, Australia’s Future Made in Australia fund, at roughly $22 billion over a decade, looks modest. Yet here, every dollar must work harder because ‘value for money’ is being redefined to mean not just fiscal prudence but sovereignty gained per taxpayer dollar spent.

Industry policy is back, but the stakes and the terrain have changed. Manufacturing’s share of Australian GDP has declined from between 13 and 14 percent in 1990 to between 5 and 6 percent today, and the nation imports around 90 percent of its refined critical minerals and battery components. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency projects global demand for lithium and rare earths will grow sixfold by 2040, magnifying both opportunity and exposure. Australia cannot match the fiscal firepower of the US or China, but it can outthink them by designing policies that leverage its comparative advantages, geographic proximity to the Indo-Pacific, and trust capital among partners seeking secure and transparent supply chains.

That requires discipline and design, not desperation. The risk today is that Future Made in Australia will become an open chequebook, a patchwork of subsidies responding to the loudest corporate voices or the most politically convenient regions. The nation’s history is littered with the remains of such ‘innovation led’ interventions: from 2008 to 2018, annual assistance typically ran in the low-to-mid-teens of billions, yet few sectors became globally competitive. A modern industry policy must do better. It must reward endurance, not entry.

That begins with redefining what sovereignty looks like in the 2020s. Resilience is not about producing everything at home; it is about ensuring that what we do make and process adds strategic weight and withstands global shocks. For Australia, that means prioritising capabilities that convert raw advantage into national strength, critical minerals, green-energy systems, defence manufacturing and logistics infrastructure in northern Australia. The north already generates more than $45 billion in exports annually, yet less than 15 percent of its output is value-added domestically. Every additional processing step captured onshore compounds economic resilience and regional employment multipliers, particularly in Darwin, Townsville and Karratha, where defence spending represents a sizeable chunk of local GDP.

In this context, the national resilience pivot is not just an economic issue but a strategic one. Building midstream capability in rare earths and battery materials, for instance, is about more than jobs or exports; it’s about denying coercive leverage to others and ensuring allied forces can source, sustain, and scale in crisis. A network of northern-based processing hubs, connected by modern transport corridors and renewable energy zones, would embed resilience into both supply chains and deterrence posture. However, such investments require coordination among federal, state and private capital.

Here lies the second fault line: governance. If Future Made in Australia is to succeed, it must evolve beyond a brand into a disciplined investment framework. This means applying clear, transparent metrics for sovereignty dividends, which are the quantifiable returns in resilience, capability and regional value creation. It also requires independent oversight to prevent subsidy capture, where well-connected firms monopolise incentives while delivering little enduring capacity. Without such guardrails, the program risks devolving into a fiscal black hole under the banner of national security.

A credible industry strategy must also align alliance economics with national benefit. Foreign investment remains critical, as partners such as Japan, Korea and the US collectively account for more than 60 percent of Australia’s critical minerals offtake. But Canberra must ensure these projects lock in Australian participation across the value chain. Co-processing, joint certification, and shared research and development can create mutual benefit while maintaining domestic skill and asset retention.

The final test is cultural. For too long, Australian industry policy has oscillated between two extremes: uncritical market faith and over-engineered state intervention. The Future Made in Australia agenda must chart a third path: strategic capitalism, where the government acts as an enabler and investor, not as an operator or benefactor. That requires reshaping bureaucratic culture from one of program delivery to one of enterprise building. Economists from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade must think like investors; Defence and industry must think like systems integrators; and northern stakeholders must be treated not as grant recipients, but as partners in the national project.

Australia’s resilience won’t be measured in policy papers or budget headlines, but in whether our ports, refineries, and supply chains can continue to operate when the next geopolitical shock strikes. Every dollar spent under Future Made in Australia must move the dial toward that outcome: greater autonomy, deeper partnerships and longer-term economic endurance.

If we get this right, Australia can position itself as the Indo-Pacific’s trusted producer, a nation that builds, refines and exports value with integrity and foresight. But if we fall into the trap of subsidy theatre, we risk eroding both fiscal credibility and strategic momentum. The choice, as ever, lies not in ambition but in execution. The Future Made in Australia agenda must evolve, fast, from stimulus to strategy, from politics to policy and from announcements to action.",https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/51401491902_b07659f8c7_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 17:58:23.673545

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.
According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 17:17:57.344665

Steve Pearce to head the public lands agency, drawing ire from environmentalists.

By Kiley Price for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped a conservation critic and former oil industry executive to head up the federal agency that oversees the majority of public lands in the United States.

If approved, former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico will lead the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for balancing conservation of public lands with human use, such as resource extraction and cattle grazing. Since January, the Trump administration has overwhelmingly prioritized the latter with the Department of the Interior—BLM’s parent agency—rapidly approving oil, gas and mining permits, including more than 600 new permits to drill on public lands since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities.

Environmental groups have spoken out vehemently against Pearce, who they say will threaten public lands and ramp up activities that fuel global warming.

A veteran and former owner of an oilfield services company, Pearce began his foray into politics as the U.S. representative for New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District from 2003 to 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. Over his seven terms in the role, Pearce strongly advocated for ranchers and the oil and gas drilling sector, the latter of which donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns. Now, industry groups are rallying around Pearce’s nomination.

“Pearce’s experience makes him thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing,” Kaitlynn Glover with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.

Republican politicians from ranch- and oil-heavy states such as Montana and Wyoming echoed these sentiments.

“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement. “This nomination is a major win for Wyoming and the entire west, and I’m glad to see such a crucial role filled by someone so well qualified. I urge a swift confirmation.”

Meanwhile, conservation groups argue that Pearce is not fit to lead an agency that also manages some of the most ecologically sensitive lands in the country, open spaces that support clean water, clean air and wildlife. As a congressman, Pearce introduced or supported several public-lands bills that would have inhibited conservation, supported more climate-warming oil and gas operations and limited the power of the Antiquities Act, which gives the president authority to protect lands by designating them as national monuments.

In 2014, he opposed former President Barack Obama’s designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico, which had widespread public support in the region. He has said that the monument, which fell within his district, was too large. The protected area is now a major driver of tourism and income for the local community of Las Cruces.

The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters, which tracks congressional voting records on environmental issues, gives Pearce a score of 4 percent—with 13 votes over his career that the group classified as pro-environment and more than 330 deemed anti-environment.

“Pearce’s entire political career has been dedicated to blocking Americans’ access to public lands while giving the oil and gas industry free rein to drill and frack anywhere they wanted,” Jennifer Rokala, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement. “Congress should quickly reject this nomination and tell the president to pay attention to what voters overwhelmingly want—public lands that are protected and managed for our kids and grandkids.”

The nomination comes seven months after Trump’s former pick, Kathleen Sgamma, the head of an oil industry trade group, withdrew from consideration following reporting that she had privately criticized Trump in 2021.

The Trump Public Lands Agenda

Democratic politicians have also expressed concern over the Pearce nomination, including Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary under President Joe Biden, who called him a “dangerous choice.”

During her four-year tenure at the Interior Department, Haaland oversaw BLM’s operations and helped enact the 2024 Public Lands Rule, which placed conservation on equal footing with uses such as natural gas drilling, mining, ranching, grazing, timber production and recreation. In September the Trump administration declared its intent to rescind the rule.

“In New Mexico we value our lands and waters, and we need a manager who would be a good steward. Steve Pearce however, has a record of threatening New Mexico’s public lands, putting profits over people, and neglecting the needs of our state,” Haaland, who is now running for New Mexico governor, said in a statement. “He is the wrong choice to serve in this role.”

Since Trump re-entered office in January, the administration has coordinated an aggressive rollback of environmental laws and policies in the United States in a push to ramp up extractive activities on public lands.

In July, the White House began the process of changing how the landmark National Environmental Policy Act is implemented across the federal government in a manner that allows the fast-tracking of fossil fuel, mining and other industrial projects. One of the first to benefit from these streamlined reviews is a gold mine project in Nevada, with far less opportunity for public comment on its permitting. Opponents fear the lack of review will threaten key aquifers and land for vulnerable animals such as the sage grouse.

Along with fast-tracking permits, the Trump administration is opening more lands for oil drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Dan Ritzman, the director of conservation at the nonprofit Sierra Club, expects Pearce would run BLM in line with this pro-extractive agenda.

“Steve Pearce is right in line with the Trump’s administration’s vision that the most important use and the people that should have the most say in our public lands are oil and gas industry executives,” Ritzman said.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.

“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House. “It’s totally logical that his nominees would align with the agenda the President was elected to implement and have a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1496818/story_image/AP25309760864310.jpg?1762533172,N,,2025-11-09 16:03:44.497260

However, in a surprising strategic shift, the company is pinning its hopes on a miniature vehicle for the Japanese market. This unexpected move raises a critical question: can this new direction stabilize the company's declining share value?

European Operations Offer a Silver Lining

As challenges mount in its home market, BYD's international business is experiencing explosive growth. Overseas revenue surged by an impressive 160 percent during the third quarter of 2025. Europe has emerged as a particularly bright spot, with BYD now commanding 30 percent of all Chinese automobile sales in Western Europe.

The company achieved a historic milestone by leading Chinese brands past their Korean competitors in Western European markets for the first time. The United Kingdom serves as a strategic bridgehead for further regional expansion. Despite this success, vehicle margins contracted to 21 percent, indicating that even BYD's vertically integrated battery manufacturing cannot completely offset industry-wide pricing pressures. Additional complications arise from regulatory uncertainties and ongoing compliance disputes.

Third Quarter Performance Disappoints

Recent financial disclosures for Q3 2025 revealed the depth of BYD's current challenges. The company reported a 3.05 percent decline in revenue, which fell to 194.985 billion yuan. More concerning was the net profit figure, which plummeted by 32.6 percent to 7.823 billion yuan.

Ad

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying BYD?

October vehicle sales dropped 12 percent to 441,706 units, reflecting the brutal price competition in China's EV sector. Rivals including Geely and Great Wall Motor are gaining market share through aggressive discount strategies.

Valuation metrics present additional concerns. BYD's price-to-earnings ratio of 21.9 significantly exceeds the industry average of 9.6, creating vulnerability for the stock should growth continue to weaken.

Japan Strategy: The Raccoon Initiative

In a dramatic departure from its established premium vehicle approach, BYD has announced the ""Racco"" – named after the Japanese word for raccoon dog (tanuki). This compact car specifically targets Japan's unique Kei-Car segment with the following specifications:

* Compact dimensions measuring 3.5 meters in length and approximately 2 meters in height

* 20 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack

* Scheduled market debut in summer 2026

* Direct competition with Nissan's Sakura model

This strategic pivot demonstrates BYD's willingness to explore niche markets beyond its traditional rivalry with Tesla, potentially opening new revenue streams as domestic pressures intensify.

The electric vehicle startup has a series of videos on its YouTube page giving some insight into the development, and the latest looks at the extensive hot-weather testing prototypes – and their engineers – have to endure.

The video depicts testing that took place during the summer in some of the desert regions of Nevada. Not only do the prototypes have to survive the heat, they also need to keep their cool – quite literally – while doing activities that stress key systems like the battery and electric motors. One of the tests involved towing a trailer up a steep grade while also carrying a payload.

Conditions like extreme heat or cold can take a toll on an EV's powertrain. For example, a battery that's too warm will have its ability to deliver power diminished. And when the battery gets too cold, range can be reduced significantly. To get around this, modern EVs are equipped with special heating and cooling systems designed to keep the vehicles operating at optimal temperatures.

Prices Subject To Change

Slate is the Jeff Bezos-backed, Michigan-based startup developing a small bare-bones electric truck that at its debut in April, was promised with a final price of less than $20,000 after factoring in federal incentives. Those incentives have expired since the debut, and Slate's website has since been updated with an expected price in the mid-$20,000 bracket. The first examples are due for delivery toward the end of 2026, and Slate states that pricing could still change further.

As the name suggests, the Slate Truck will be a sort of blank slate that customers will be able to personalize – and Slate is promising plenty of options that no doubt will quickly inflate the sticker. For example, all Slates will start out life with the same gray finish, but the company will offer wraps for anyone wanting to add color. There will also be an SUV kit that will turn the standard two-seat truck into a five-seat SUV. This kit will also come in three different flavors: either a standard SUV body, a sporty fastback body, or an open-top body with no roof or windows.

Key Specifications

The Slate Truck measures just 174.6 inches long, making it only slightly longer than a compact Nissan Leaf. Despite the small size, the bed will still be a decent five feet, which is the same for some configurations of midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger and Nissan Frontier. Slate quotes a maximum payload of 1,433 pounds and towing capacity of 1,000 pounds, so don't expect to do any heavy lifting with this truck.

The Slate Truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. It comes standard with a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery (estimated 150 miles of range), with an optional 84.3-kWh pack boosting range to about 240 miles. Charging is handled via a Tesla-compatible NACS port, with DC fast-charging up to 120 kilowatts, allowing 20%-80% charging in about 30 minutes, according to the company's website.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/slate-truck-4.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-09 15:18:51.844835

In Germany, a troubling debate is gathering pace: could Stuttgart, the heart of the country’s car industry, follow Detroit’s path? Experts are divided. Some argue Germany moved too slowly on electric vehicles and now risks surrendering its lead. Others believe Stuttgart can still avoid a crash if it keeps a steady balance between established manufacturing and emerging technologies.

Jürgen Dispan of the IMU Institute in Stuttgart treats Detroit less as a verdict and more as a warning. He notes that the region rests on a broader industrial base—from mechanical engineering to R&D and engineering centers. Yet, in his view, survival depends on keeping development and production tightly linked to maintain momentum through electrification. That alignment is not a slogan; it will decide who sets the pace.

The challenge is sharpened by high labor costs and shorter working hours, which make German cars more expensive. Researcher Stefan Bratzel recalls that these very factors once sped Detroit’s decline, as American brands reacted too late to market pressures. The parallel with Detroit is hard to ignore.

For now, the notion of a German Detroit remains a hypothesis, but the concern is justified. The global auto industry is being remade: the software-defined, electric, automated vehicle is no longer a question of if. For Stuttgart, the issue is not timing but readiness to lead the next era.

Stuttgart is unlikely to become a second Detroit, but the time for deliberation is over. If Germany intends to preserve its leadership, it will need to stop defending the past and start building the future.",https://speedme.ru/uploads/en_materials/big_webp/zRwDXMHBhEiUgGllb4wt.webp,N,,2025-11-09 16:18:25.703318

Opinion | How to Fix America’s Soaring Electricity Prices | The New York Times (gift link)

The cost of electricity is a highly salient political issue now. Tyler Norris has some ideas for how to bend the curve and, as usual, there’s a Texas angle.

For the moment, higher power bills stem mostly from volatile natural gas prices and the costs utilities are passing on to customers to modernize the aging grid and rebuild power lines and substations damaged by wildfires in the West, hurricanes along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and other extreme weather.

Electricity markets are also beginning to feel the squeeze from an explosive growth in new users. Take the country’s largest power market, serving the Mid-Atlantic and some of the Midwest, where tight supply and dozens of new data centers have led to a nearly tenfold jump in the cost of guaranteeing enough power supply when it’s most needed.

The new electricity demand doesn’t automatically raise bills. A recent study showed that states where electricity use grew fastest often saw average household prices fall, while states with flat or declining use saw prices rise. The impact depends, in significant part, on how cleverly the existing grid is managed — and whether that new energy demand occurs at times when the grid is already strained.

…[In] Texas, regulators are beginning to require large users to be the first to cut their power use during emergencies, helping spare households from outages.

The federal government is now validating this approach. In an extraordinary move, on Oct. 23 the Department of Energy directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to propose a rule that would allow new data centers and factories to plug into the grid years sooner if they agree to lower their use during the rare hours when supplies run tight. The proposal has drawn strikingly broad, bipartisan support.

Some data centers that specialize in instant, on-demand services — like web search, streaming or chat — may find it impractical to dial back during peak hours. But even then, similar benefits can be achieved if data centers pay residential and business electricity consumers to shift their use during extreme peak hours with smart thermostats, networked appliances and battery systems that can adjust automatically. That could provide the same relief for the system while data centers compensate other users directly. (emphasis added).

I covered this idea of data centers paying for electricity demand – and cost – reductions on the podcast with Astrid Atkinson of Camus Energy and recorded one with Tyler on data center flexibility as well.

China’s clean-energy revolution will reshape markets and politics | The Economist (gift link)

The Economist did a fantastic job in a series of articles exploring China’s energy dominance.

The US absolutely could provide a meaningful counterweight – something I explored with American solar manufacturer T1 – but it would require broad political consensus to pursue an all-of-the-above strategy that includes both molecules and electrons, fossils and renewables.

The scale of the renewables revolution in China is almost too vast for the human mind to grasp… The 22m tonnes of steel used to build new wind turbines and solar panels in 2024 would have been enough to build a Golden Gate Bridge on every working day of every week that year…

In the context of the cold war, the distinctive measure of a “superpower” was the combination of a continental span and a world-threatening nuclear arsenal. The coming-together of China’s enormous manufacturing capacity and its ravenous appetite for copious, cheap, domestically produced electricity deserves to be seen in a similar world-changing light. They have made China a new type of superpower: one which deploys clean electricity on a planetary scale.

China is exporting its revolution to the rest of the world. America’s current government rejects renewable technologies. In Europe industry is hollowing out and voters are rebelling against expensive green policies. But it is in developing countries that the fight against climate change will be won or lost, and it is there that Chinese renewables will make the most difference.

China is now making more money from exporting green technology than America makes from exporting fossil fuels. This trend will continue simply because renewables are cheap; if you doubt the appeal, count the solar panels on Pakistani roofs.

Even if you don’t care about climate change at all for national security and economic reasons alone, the US needs to have a share of the renewable export market. If it happens, Texas will play a major role – and reap the benefits of having both electrons and molecules to export.

Most of these lawsuits have been launched by blue cities and states in friendly jurisdictions, banking on judges to link state consumer protection and nuisance laws with global climate change.
Research by economist Wayne Winegarden indicates that combining energy lawsuits seeking damages at (a conservative) $100 billion equates to a 31 cents per gallon price increase for consumers at the pump — meaning an extra $326 per household per year.
President Trump has vowed to put an end to the climate lawsuits, but his executive orders can only go so far.
v. Suncor Energy argues the court should recognize lawmakers’ role in regulating emissions and swat away state-level attempts at punishing oil and gas firms for climate change.","The Trump administration is taking a well-earned victory lap after successfully delaying a carbon tax on the shipping and logistics industry at a United Nations meeting in London last month.

“The U.S. achieved a diplomatic victory and successfully rallied a coalition to stop the body’s proposed ‘net-zero framework,’” wrote Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the effort to delay by one year a proposal to implement new climate rules at the International Maritime Organization.

Our diplomats are right to celebrate Americans being shielded from new taxes on their energy consumption coming from abroad, but right here at home, new costs are being folded into household energy budgets every day. Anyone with a gas tank to fill or house to heat is feeling it.

For the last decade in local courts, municipalities and states have waged their own legal battles against American energy providers to extract massive settlements over their alleged failure to acknowledge culpability in global climate change.

Most of these lawsuits have been launched by blue cities and states in friendly jurisdictions, banking on judges to link state consumer protection and nuisance laws with global climate change. It is no coincidence that most cases have been launched in places like Colorado, California and Hawaii, and progressive college town enclaves such as Carrboro, N.C., where more sympathetic district judges might allow cases to proceed.

These efforts have been coordinated by well-connected groups of state attorneys generals, university law programs and millions of dollars in funding from philanthropists who believe that climate litigation will help “bankrupt” oil and gas firms. David Bookbinder, a director at the Environmental Integrity Project who formerly was on the legal team in the suit launched against oil firms by the city of Boulder, Colo., recently admitted as much.

For many climate activists who have turned to the courts, the use of tort law is a deliberate attempt to weaponize America’s litigation addiction to further their goals of reining in fossil fuel companies, no matter the cost to consumers. It’s a carbon tax by another name. Research by economist Wayne Winegarden indicates that combining energy lawsuits seeking damages at (a conservative) $100 billion equates to a 31 cents per gallon price increase for consumers at the pump — meaning an extra $326 per household per year.

We all pay for this. And although a lot of attention has been given to the role that data centers are playing in local debates about energy bills, not enough has been said as to the adverse effect of ideological climate lawfare.

Where does this all end? President Trump has vowed to put an end to the climate lawsuits, but his executive orders can only go so far.

The Supreme Court has so far declined to take up the matter or force disputes to federal courts, but Congress has made its opinion known. A recent amicus brief filed by Republicans in County Commissioners of Boulder County. v. Suncor Energy argues the court should recognize lawmakers’ role in regulating emissions and swat away state-level attempts at punishing oil and gas firms for climate change.

If that brief ends up convincing members of the high bench, it will be to the advantage of American consumers, who depend on affordable energy to power their lives. If these lawsuits can continue unabated, there is no telling what the economic consequences will be. At the very least they cause a slow, almost invisible drag on the economy.

Whatever happens, Americans need to know that backdoor carbon taxes and shakedown schemes are being cooked up regularly by international bureaucrats in faraway capitals, and many more are brewing here at home, right in our own courts.

India is set to become an expert in the domestic wind power manufacturing sector","As the world faces increased pressure on the energy sector, several nations are turning to wind power to alleviate the stress. Most nations have some degree of flexibility in their energy portfolios; however, some nations have stagnated in their embrace of the renewable energy sector. One nation that has become a global leader in wind power component manufacturing is India. India has an exceedingly large population, which means that demand for energy outpaces supply most of the time. As such, the Indian government has called on the domestic manufacturing sector to pick up the pace.

India’s government has called on the wind power sector to increase manufacturing

Several prominent Indian officials have called on the domestic wind manufacturing sector to increase production dramatically. At a recent wind power event, India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, said that domestic value addition is crucial for the nation to foster a competitive wind power component manufacturing sector that can compete with the rest of the world.

“With indigenisation and high local content, India can capture 10 percent of the global wind supply chain by 2030 and further to 20 percent by 2040. For India is among the five countries that manufacture the most wind components domestically.” – India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi

India has some of the worst emission numbers on the planet, with several cities being blanketed in a cloud of smog that is equivalent to smoking several packs of cigarettes a day, on a good day. As a result, the nation has planned to increase spending on renewable energy production, like wind power. Additionally, India is leaning on the extensive and often overlooked work ethic of its populace to become a global leader in manufacturing wind power components.

India’s government has called for an increase in wind component production to 85%

At the recent 7th edition of ‘Windergy India 2025’, government officials called on the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMS), or any other wind power component manufacturers, to increase domestic production from the current levels of 65% to an astonishing 85% in order to effectively compete with other nations.

Wind energy currently accounts for nearly one-fifth of India’s energy generation capacity, and the government wants to increase that reliance on the sector dramatically. India has become an essential provider of crucial wind components for the world, as many nations struggle with China’s dominance in the supply chain.

““Amidst evolving global dynamics and rising geo-political challenges, it is necessary to align with the vision of the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat in clean energy. The goal is to achieve the renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030, in which wind power will play a crucial role by contributing 100 GW or more.” – India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi

The minister also noted that India already has a foothold in the international wind power supply chain, with orders in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Brazil, not to mention that India is challenging China’s supply chain with orders from several Asian nations.

How can there be such a contrast? The truth is that while the US president’s posture on climate change represents an extreme, few people in the US really believe that such a transformation of the energy system is possible. This is true, I think, even of the advocates for that transformation. I am one of those advocates, and even I haven’t fully believed in its possibility. I was more likely to believe that the truth lay closer to a declaration by Mark Mills, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, that a transition away from society’s dependence on hydrocarbons “is not feasible in any meaningful time frame”.

Why was I so skeptical that this transformation could take place? Those realists who doubt that it can occur within a reasonable time frame point to several facts. First, energy transitions in the past have taken a century, not decades. And they have never been complete. Coal replaced wood, but dependence on wood lingered on for many people. Oil replaced coal, but coal continued to be used in massive amounts. Natural gas pushed some coal and oil aside, but those fuels still sell in massive quantities. And nuclear energy surged for two or three decades but never pushed coal aside.

They also point out that while solar and wind power are surging throughout the globe — it is often said that nearly all new power generation in recent years has been wind and solar — the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has continued to rise at about the same pace as it has for almost 70 years.

Also contributing to my own skepticism was the poor arguments the enthusiasts for wind and solar made for the economic viability of these renewables. They claimed that it had been proved that wind and solar were the cheapest forms of energy. But as evidence for that claim, they cited levelized cost-of-energy comparisons performed by a financial firm, Lazard Freres. Comparisons on that basis of wind and solar with coal, gas, and nuclear are, however, apples-to-oranges comparisons because they don’t consider the whole system cost.

Such biased and incomplete arguments for wind and solar on the part of too many of its advocates, often made with an attitude of complete certainty, as if these were undeniable scientific facts, provoked skepticism.

But I have changed my mind. This change of mind was cemented by a book I just read, Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change — in 50 Questions and Answers, by Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist and senior researcher at the University of Oxford and deputy editor at Our World in Data. Ritchie does not express the exaggerated aspirations that overenthusiastic renewables advocates proclaim; she is more realistic about the energy transition. She advises the enthusiastic advocates to “stop obsessing over arbitrary targets (such as, for example, ‘net zero by 2050’) and focus on how you can help to reduce our carbon emissions as quickly as possible”. She says, “A completely fossil-free world is not going to happen overnight. Not even in the next 20 years. We should be upfront about that. It is a transition, not an on-off switch.”

The truth is that while the US president’s posture on climate change represents an extreme, few people in the US really believe that such a transformation of the energy system is possible

But then she shows in 50 concise chapters how the transition can take place, perhaps even soon, and it is all credible. Technologies for some of them are not ready yet, and many are still too expensive. But it makes Mills’ statement “not feasible in any meaningful time frame” seem far too pessimistic.

As for China’s coal plants, she points out that “China has been using its coal plants less and less. In the early 2000s, plants were running around 70 percent of the time, but this has since dropped to around 50 percent and will keep falling”. China is using its coal plants in the same way that the US is using gas, to deal with the intermittency of renewables — that is, to generate electricity when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Solving this problem in the long run will require better and lower-cost batteries, and long-distance transmission lines, on both of which China is a leader. And it will likely require large quantities of nuclear energy too, the construction of which China again leads.

We find it hard to believe that a transition away from the energy systems we have all been used to for many decades will really happen. The habit of extrapolation is in human nature. What we have been doing is, we feel intuitively, likely to be what we will be doing, no matter the hype around artificial intelligence, or the energy transition, or climate change itself. It may be advisable to pay some attention to this intuition when it comes to AI, but not when it comes to climate change and the energy transition.

Ritchie makes a seemingly unremarkable but highly pertinent observation toward the end of the book that wraps it up well: “We accept that changes have happened in the past but are skeptical that tomorrow, next year or the next decade will be much different. When it comes to climate technologies, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Things are changing quickly.”

These infrastructures will increase the volume of natural gas transport and contribute to price reduction through economies of scale.
: What is the role of natural gas in Europe’s green transition?
Natural gas acts as a stabilizer of the system.
Energean has demonstrated that natural gas production can be done with a very low carbon footprint, as shown by our activity in Israel.","The new geopolitical and energy landscape emerging after the transatlantic conference in Athens, attended by top American and European officials, signals a clear upgrade of Greece’s role as a strategic partner of the United States in Southeastern Europe. The strengthened American presence confirmed Washington’s intention to further deepen relations with Athens, highlighting our country as a key energy and geopolitical point between East and West.

The total valuation of the agreements supported by the new era in Greek-American relations exceeds €30 billion, as it rests on two parallel pillars of cooperation.

The first concerns the natural gas and LNG infrastructure sector, with an estimated value of about €26 billion over 20 years, while the second relates to accelerating cooperation in hydrocarbons, which could yield investments of €5 to €10 billion under certain conditions, at least regarding the Ionian block, into which ExxonMobil recently entered. The scale of these investments will be multiple if discoveries are made in the blocks south and southwest of Crete, which will open the way – provided licensing obstacles and potential legal disputes are overcome – for the country to become a natural gas producer for the first time.

What the conference brought

The first pillar is implemented within the framework of the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation (P-TEC), where the close energy ties between the two countries were transformed into specific agreements for the supply and absorption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) quantities ranging from 0.7 to 4 billion cubic meters per year, with prices calculated based on current natural gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub (€33/MWh).

This first multi-year contract with the USA in Europe is acquired by Atlantic See LNG Trade S.A. This is the newly established joint company between Aktor and DEPA Commercial at 60%-40%, which on Friday signed the 20-year supply contract with the American Venture Global – one of the largest LNG players based in Louisiana. This is an agreement that Americans link to the Alexandroupolis terminal (FSRU), in which the company participates with a capacity of 25%.

Konstantinos Xifaras, Alexandros Exarchou, and the representative of Venture Global Inc sign the twenty-year American LNG import contract

Through the FSRU infrastructure, Greece aims to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from the USA for export through the so-called Vertical Corridor, which connects Greece with Ukraine via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. Greece’s role in natural gas transportation is expected to increase further when the EU proceeds with a complete ban on Russian supplies, as decided from 2028. When the transit of Russian gas through Turk Stream (the main gateway of Russian gas to Southeast Europe) ends, it is estimated that about 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas will need to be immediately replaced, while together with neighboring countries’ needs, the quantities are estimated at 20 to 22 bcm.

Agreements with the countries of the Vertical Corridor (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Moldova), with which individual negotiations will follow to finalize quantities, foresee a minimum annual supply of up to 700 million cubic meters, which will serve as a consumption and absorption threshold for the system’s viability. This minimum quantity ensures stable flows and predictability for infrastructure investments, allowing banks and institutional financiers to safely support transport and storage projects. A key role in this sector is played by the DFC (Development Finance Corporation). The US State Development Bank is considering having an active role in the agreement linked to the DEPA Commercial – Aktor joint venture, which is Greek-based and operates in seven countries in the region.

According to information, the American presence will not be limited to simple lending but will include equity participation and board representation in the company, making it the US arm in Southeast Europe for energy security matters. The presence of the DFC is expected to act as a multiplier of trust and stability for the broader investment structure, facilitating access to capital and the participation of American and European banks.

The significance of the deal for Aktor

The agreement for American LNG marks a new era for Aktor as well, expanding its activity beyond construction into energy, with a deal that strengthens its position as a national energy player with an international footprint. From a company that built infrastructure projects, it is transformed within a few years into a group actively participating in energy production and distribution, representing the most ambitious project the company has ever undertaken, placing it at the center of developments for the coming decades.

The plan even includes investment in LNG transport ships, with a total cost of about €1 billion. The company will need to evaluate in the coming period whether to charter or purchase LNG transport vessels from the US, given that the transport cost is estimated at €30–40 million per year.

Contract duration

The start of the long-term contract to supply the countries of the Vertical Energy Corridor with American LNG is set for 2030, with intermediate phases in 2027–2028, when the final withdrawal of Russian natural gas from the European market is expected. Already, at the end of 2026, DEPA Commercial’s contract with Gazprom expires. Although the last negotiation with the Russians, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement due to a long-standing dispute over gas pricing, provides for an extension, a plan is being promoted for the gradual termination of Russian gas flows by 2027.

As well-informed sources report, the United States clearly intends to cooperate with a unified and reliable partner in the region. The Greek company, in which DEPA and Aktor will participate, will fulfill this purpose, functioning as the US energy arm for Southeast and Central Europe. For the success of the project, it is emphasized that long-term contracts are required, such as the 20-year contract with Venture Global, which will provide investment security and allow financing of new infrastructure, such as floating regasification stations (new FSRUs) and new interconnection pipelines. These infrastructures will increase the volume of natural gas transport and contribute to price reduction through economies of scale.

On the discussion table is also the prospect of constructing a pipeline between Alexandroupolis and Ukraine, which would further strengthen the region’s energy security. Although considered an ambitious plan, it is emphasized that guaranteed transport volumes supported by geopolitical developments and significant financing are required. In the new energy map shaped by the withdrawal of Russian gas from the European market, Ukraine is also considered a country of strategic importance due to its large storage capacity (about 30 bcm), corresponding to 15% of total European storage capacity. Utilizing this capacity provides stability in gas supply and will enhance Europe’s energy autonomy, especially after progressive disengagement from Russian gas.

The drilling rigs

The second pillar of Greek-American cooperation concerns accelerating research and investments in hydrocarbons. ExxonMobil, with a 60% stake in Ionian Block 2, proceeds in collaboration with the Greek side, with the remaining 30% allocated to Greek Energean, which manages the Prinos field in Kavala, and 10% to Helleniq Energy (formerly Hellenic Petroleum). The American upstream giant has also undertaken the processing of 3D seismic data for the offshore blocks “Southwest” and “West of Crete,” also with Helleniq Energy.

ExxonMobil Vice President John Ardill stated in recent days that the data processing will be completed in the first half of 2026 so that a decision can be made on whether an exploratory drilling will take place in 2027 in the “Southwest Crete” block. This issue remains open for the company, which has been present in Greece since 2019, confirming that the reality of hydrocarbons is far more complex than usually presented.

INTERVIEW

Mathios Rigas: CEO of Energean

“A discovery in Block 2 will have a catalytic effect on Greece’s development”

$80 million investment in exploratory drilling, multiples if a field is found – Potential resources 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Ionian

An investment of $80 million for exploratory drilling, which will be multiple if a field is found, opens with the participation of Americans in the Ionian concession. Energean and ExxonMobil are proceeding with exploratory drilling in Block 2, west of Corfu, one of the most promising areas of the Mediterranean, with potential resources reaching 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Energean CEO Mathios Rigas explains to THEMA the significance of the agreement, the next steps, and the role of natural gas in the new energy reality.

Marianna Tzanne: What does your cooperation with ExxonMobil for Block 2 signify?

Mathios Rigas: The agreement is of strategic importance both for Energean and for the country. ExxonMobil participates with 60%, Energean with 30%, remaining operator in the first phase, and HelleniQ Energy with 10%. The fact that a global energy giant trusts us to manage the critical exploratory drilling shows our technical competence and reliability.

The cooperation was based on data from the 2022 three-dimensional seismic survey, covering an area of over 2,200 square kilometers. After a year of negotiations, an $80 million investment was set in motion – an important step for Greece’s energy independence. If a discovery occurs, the investments will be multiple, while ExxonMobil will undertake the development phase.

The presence of American officials at the signing of the agreement underlines that this is a move with geopolitical dimension, integrated into the US strategy for energy stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

M.T.: What are the next steps and what challenges do you foresee for Block 2?

M.R.: The first crucial step is exploratory drilling, expected at the end of 2026 or early 2027, if the licensing procedures proceed without delays. The big challenge is European bureaucracy: regulations have become more complex, imposing checks that often act as a disincentive.

Balance, transparency, and responsibility are needed, but without harming competitiveness. Europe must maintain the ability to attract investments, especially in the energy sector. The example of Prinos shows that in Greece we can combine production and environmental protection: it has operated for 45 years in full harmony with tourism and fishing, something we are proud of.

M.T.: How does this project fit into Greece’s energy security strategy?

M.R.: Greece has progressed in diversifying energy sources and routes, but still depends on imports. The existence of domestic fields is not just an economic issue; it is a matter of national power and independence.

The development of Block 2 and other fields can strengthen an energy security network connecting Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, and Italy. This is also the essence of Energean’s strategy for the Mediterranean: creating a stable regional pillar.

In 2024, Energean produced 7.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Mediterranean, a quantity greater than the country’s current consumption. This experience gives us confidence that we can contribute substantially to Greece’s energy self-sufficiency.

M.T.: What is the role of natural gas in Europe’s green transition?

M.R.: For years we talked about energy transition, meaning replacing fossil fuels with cleaner forms. Today, however, reality is different: needs are increasing, networks require stable power, and renewables cannot yet meet demand without a reliable baseload source.

Natural gas acts as a stabilizer of the system. Globally, more than $4 trillion is expected to be invested in the energy sector in the coming years. The issue is not simply “transition” but the “addition” of clean and reliable energy.

Energean has demonstrated that natural gas production can be done with a very low carbon footprint, as shown by our activity in Israel. With the carbon dioxide storage project in Prinos, we take another step toward the green transition.",https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/xrwma-deals-1.jpg-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 14:03:35.015931

TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2025 /CNW/ - Global trade upheavals, rapid technological change, and the clean transition are reshaping the world economy. Canada's economic strategy must adapt--and fast. Budget 2025: Canada Strong is our plan to make our economy stronger, more self-sufficient, and resilient to global shocks. It will catalyse over $1 trillion in investment over the next five years, driving growth in nuclear, hydro, wind, energy storage, and grid infrastructure to make Canada a leader in the low-carbon economy.

Investing in a clean future is both a moral imperative and the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. As the world moves toward net zero, Canada's climate competitiveness will define Canada's leadership on the world stage. By 2035, the clean technology market will triple, and demand for clean electricity will double. To compete, Canada's investment must keep pace.

Today, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, outlined the government's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy at the Pearl Street Energy Centre in Toronto. The strategy, which positions Canada to compete and win in this new global landscape, is anchored by three pillars:

Boosting investment through Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits to make it more affordable for Canadian industries to transition to clean energy, modernise electricity grids, expand renewables, increase energy storage, and strengthen power connections across provinces. Our plan will:

Implement the 15% Clean Electricity investment tax credit and remove the conditions imposed on provincial and territorial governments for their Crown corporations to be eligible.

Expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the 30% Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit.

Supercharge affordable, net-zero energy projects with the following tax credits:

Clean Technology, expanding eligibility to include systems that produce electricity, heat, or both electricity and heat from waste biomass and changed the eligibility requirements for small nuclear energy.

Clean Hydrogen, introducing availability for hydrogen produced from methane pyrolysis under this tax credit.

Extend the full value of the Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage investment tax credit by five years through 2035.

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing to reduce emissions and provide long-term certainty for businesses and investors. Effective industrial carbon markets are integral to driving investment in clean growth and emissions reductions. We are committing to improving carbon markets across the country to provide the confidence and predictability that industry requires to invest and grow. Our plan will:

Engage with provinces and territories to develop a post-2030 carbon pricing trajectory. We will set an industrial carbon price trajectory that supports net-zero by 2050, giving businesses the confidence they need to make long-term investments in climate competitiveness.

Engage with provincial and territorial governments on improvements to the federal benchmark. This process will ensure pricing systems across the country are working effectively and enable the implementation of a strengthened benchmark. Additionally, we will explore opportunities to harmonise or link carbon credit markets.

Apply the federal backstop whenever a provincial or territorial system falls below a strengthened federal benchmark, to ensure a stringent price signal and level playing field across the country.

The Canada Growth Fund will continue to issue contracts for difference as a means of further improving future carbon price certainty for investors making large, long-duration capital investments.

Clarifying greenhouse gas regulations, including finalizing enhanced methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. By tightening these regulations, we will significantly reduce emissions across Canada, while providing clarity and predictability for industry. We will also finalise new methane regulations for landfills. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases--80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period--and one of the easiest to reduce.

In parallel, Canada's new government is investing in the critical minerals that will power the clean energy future. Budget 2025 commits over $2 billion in new investments over five years to accelerate production, create thousands of new-high-paying careers, and strengthen our position in this strategic global market. Through a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, the First and Last Mile Fund, and expanded eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we will bring more Canadian critical minerals projects into production and unlock the next generation of clean technology supply chains, from electric vehicles to advanced manufacturing.

Combined, these measures form a bold new strategy to supercharge Canadian competitiveness in the global transformation to clean energy. By investing in our people, technologies, and natural resources, we can strengthen our economy today, build resilience for the future, and position Canada as a clean energy superpower in a net-zero world.

Quotes

""Canada must act with urgency, unity, and determination. At this critical moment, we have a choice: lead--and seize the opportunities of the energy transition--or get left behind. With the Climate Competitiveness Strategy, we are positioning climate action and economic growth as inseparable, aiming to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more competitive Canada for decades to come. This will help us take action in a way that prioritises affordability for Canadians and strengthens our economy.""

– The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

""Canada is securing our place as a global energy and resource superpower--and by doing it responsibly and sustainably, we are securing wins for Canadians and the planet. We know what a strong economy and clean environment require, and our Strategy provides it: clarity and predictability that drives innovation, attracts investment, and mobilises capital. We have a responsibility to protect Canada's environment and economy for generations to come, and that delivery starts now.""

– The Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources

Quick facts

The Strategy outlines clear rules that will cut emissions, drive innovation, and attract investment. Public and private capital will be mobilised toward a net-zero economy, establishing sustainable investment guidelines, a Sustainable Bonds Framework, improving climate disclosures in collaboration with provinces and territories, and amending anti-greenwashing provisions to improve investor certainty.

Our government's commitment to a low-carbon economy is reflected in the work of the Major Projects Office (MPO). One of the criteria for designation as a Project of National Interest is how a project will contribute to clean growth and to Canada's objectives with respect to climate change. This office will continue to evaluate projects for fast-tracking based in part on their contributions to clean growth and Canada's climate goals.

The first unit of the Darlington New Nuclear Project will provide reliable and affordable clean power to 300,000 homes, and position Canada as a global leader in the deployment of this technology worldwide.

Expected to be the first net-zero copper project in Canada, the McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project will strengthen Canada's supply of critical minerals, creating hundreds of new careers across local economies.

The Red Chris Mine expansion will increase Canada's annual copper production by over 15% and reduce the mine's greenhouse gas emissions by over 70% when operational.

Wind West could be Canada's first offshore wind development and will set the scale, direction and trajectory for future growth. Unlocking 5,000 MW in the first phase could produce 24 TWh of clean energy every year and drive billions in new investment and economic activity across Canada, led by the private sector. This Eastern Energy Partnership could include important projects like interties between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, transmission cables between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick as well as Quebec's and Newfoundland and Labrador's further development of Churchill Falls and Gull Island.

Alto High-Speed Railway, spanning approximately 1,000 km from Toronto to Quebec City and reaching speeds of up to 300km/hour to cut travel times in half and connect close to half of Canada's population. This project targets 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings, the creation of 51,000 new jobs and 63,000 new housing units along its route.

This approach also extends beyond those industries. In homebuilding, factory-built homes will give more Canadians an affordable place to live while cutting emissions by over 20% compared with traditional construction methods.

Carbon pricing systems are a major component of Canada's clean investment landscape. Seventy major decarbonization projects across the country, collectively worth over $57 billion, are supported by industrial carbon markets. Around $4.3 billion in annual clean energy investment is linked directly to the existence of carbon pricing for large industrial emitters.

Budget 2025 commits to implementing the 15 % Clean Electricity investment tax credit, which will be available once legislation is passed and guidance finalized. This can cover 15 % of capital costs of eligible investment in equipment related to low-emitting electricity generation, electricity storage and interjurisdictional transmission projects.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

The government will provide transparent updates on progress and introduce new metrics to measure how businesses and households are cutting emissions, how the clean economy is expanding, and how Canadian exports are tracking to achieve world-leading emissions intensity.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like wildfires, drought, floods, and more severe storms. Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5 to 6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says that extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses in 2024.

Nations’ emission reduction commitments, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), have collectively fallen short of the Paris Agreement goals, according to the U.N.’s latest NDC Synthesis Report. As such, Palau on behalf of the Association of Small Island States has proposed an agenda item to accelerate near-term climate ambition especially as the danger of surpassing the crucial 1.5 degrees Celsius goal is evident. Countries will also need to reach agreement on indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation, an issue made more urgent by dire climate impacts already unfolding and most acutely harming the lowest income nations. Scaling up climate finance to at least $1.3 trillion by 2035 is the focus of the Baku to Belém Roadmap to support lower-income countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change.

The Trump administration is unlikely to send an official delegation to COP30, which would be a COP first, while the United States’s formal exit from the Paris Agreement will take effect in January 2026. A contingent of U.S. leaders representing states, cities, Tribal nations, businesses and other institutions will be in Belém to demonstrate continued commitment to the goals of the Agreement.

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). She has more than 20 years of experience working on international climate and energy issues, is a regular attendee of the annual U.N. climate talks and is attending COP30.

“World leaders coming to Belém must face up to the undeniable scientific and real-world evidence of their grossly insufficient efforts thus far to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. At COP30, they must commit to meeting their responsibilities to sharply cut heat-trapping emissions, ensure widespread access to affordable renewable energy, invest in a just phase out of fossil fuels and protect people from the ravages of climate change-fueled disasters. Breaching 1.5 C also has enormous consequences for climate Loss and Damage, as poorer nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis endure a steep toll resulting primarily from richer nations’ failure to adequately curtail their heat-trapping emissions.

“It’s in every nation’s self-interest to limit dangerous climate change and embrace the economic and public health benefits of a clean energy transition—and it’s in the global collective interest. The rest of the world must isolate the Trump administration in its deeply harmful actions and anti-science rhetoric and forge ahead to secure an ambitious global consensus. The time for further delay, zero sum thinking and hiding behind other countries’ inaction is over as the planet teeters on the brink of overshooting 1.5 C of warming.”

Below is a statement by Kate Cell, senior climate campaign manager at UCS and Climate Action Against Disinformation steering committee member and policy working group co-chair.

“This COP’s proposed action agenda is the first to include information integrity as a key objective, creating a critical moment to demand that online search engines and platforms be held to the basic requirements of transparency, safety and accountability that regulate other products. The actions of some of the world’s richest people—leaders from the Big Tech sector—are contributing to climate denial, deception and delay just as leaders of the fossil fuel industry do. In much of the world, billions of daily online queries and interactions are an opportunity for Big Oil to serve dis-informing content with Big Tech’s connivance. As the world faces increasing climate risk, most acutely experienced by the people least responsible for breaching 1.5 C, Big Tech billionaires have proved they are not to be trusted with a livable future for the generations to come. It is past time for systemic solutions to the problem of our polluted information ecosystem.”

Below is a statement by Dr. Astrid Caldas, senior climate scientist for community resilience at UCS.

“The biodiversity impacts of climate change have been multiplying at an alarming rate as wildfires, drought, extreme heat and ocean acidification take a toll on the health of forests, oceans and species globally. Meanwhile, deforestation and changes in land use for agriculture and oil extraction have consequences not only for the environment but for Indigenous and traditional communities that have historically lived off and stewarded the land. Loss of species and other natural resources of cultural significance are undermining these communities’ ability to live in their traditional ways. Action to prevent further warming is essential to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, which in turn helps prevent more future warming. At COP, nations must also commit to well-funded actions to protect forest ecosystems that recognize the rights of Indigenous peoples and directly include their participation in decision-making.”

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-11-09 17:00:38+00:00,The Nevada Independent,Almost all Nevada film tax credits aren't used by film companies. Here's why.,"undefined, thenevadaindependent.com, eric-neugeboren, tabitha-mueller",,,,,https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/almost-all-nevada-film-tax-credits-arent-used-by-film-companies-heres-why,"But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.
Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program.
In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees.
Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits.
Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.","For years, those looking to expand Nevada’s film tax credit program have touted their potential to bring jobs, diversify the state’s economy and even provide funding for pre-K programs.

But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.

In the more than 10-year history of Nevada’s film tax credit program, more than 98 percent of the credits have been transferred from movie studios to other companies. In total, the state has issued more than $35 million in tax credits, but only about $600,000 have not been transferred.

In Nevada, film tax credits offered by the state are transferrable by law, meaning that studios qualifying for the credits are allowed to sell the credits to other businesses for cash (usually for less than the value of the credits), which can then use them to offset their own tax liability. The three tax types that the credits can be used for are not significant burdens on film companies, which is why they rarely use it themselves.

That structure is not novel — federally, these kinds of credits have been created for projects ranging from clean energy to low-income housing, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, Nevada lawmakers could massively expand the film tax credit program by twelve-fold in the upcoming fall special session, prompting concerns from progressive groups and economists opposed to film tax credits that it could functionally serve as a handout to already wealthy corporations and prevent the state from using its dollars on other programs.

“The only purpose to make these tax credits transferable is to launder subsidy payments through other businesses’ tax returns,” said James Hohman, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based nonprofit that advocates for limited government. “The derogatory term ‘launder’ may seem extreme. That's exactly what is going on in the situation.”

UNR Economics Professor Elliott Parker disagreed with Hohman’s characterization, saying it’s a frequently used tool for economic development, and referred to the transferable structure as more of a “sleight of hand” budgeting maneuver.

“We’re making it look like we're giving them a break on the taxes that they pay,” Parker explained. “But in fact, what we're doing is we're allowing them to make money by selling it to other firms that would have been paying those taxes.”

But he said the proposal to set aside $120 million in tax credits each year for the next 15 years would undoubtedly have an effect on the state’s budget and ability to collect taxes and that’s something lawmakers need to consider.

Proponents of film tax credits have said transferable credits are preferred by governments as a means to attract and sustain economic activity because they do not require a direct cash appropriation to a company, which is prohibited under state law.

David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes — the developer behind the proposed studio project — said the legislation is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” that requires $1.8 billion in investments from companies before they receive the credits, and the whole idea is for the state to meet economic goals and create jobs it wouldn’t get without the tax credits.

“The proposed legislation doesn’t hand out cash — it rewards private investment and local hiring,” O’Reilly said. “These are precisely the kinds of smart, performance-based incentives that will help future-proof Nevada’s economy and keep our most talented residents working here at home.”

How the transferring works

As is the case with Nevada’s existing film tax credit program, the proposal likely to be discussed during the upcoming special session could be used to offset payments related to the state’s insurance premium tax, gaming license fees or modified business tax (which is assessed on payroll).

However, film studios are only subject to the payroll tax, meaning that the credits would likely be sold for cash to gaming or insurance companies to offset their own tax burden.

Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program. That means it could take considerable time for the tax credit to be redeemed in full, according to the film office. The credits must be redeemed within four years of being granted.

It is also standard practice for film production companies to use outside groups to facilitate payroll for their employees, meaning those third parties would be subject to the tax rather than the film production company.

In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees. Credits used for the modified business tax are a distant third.

Notably, the state considers the individual details of these transfers to be confidential, leaving the public in the dark about which companies are buying the tax credits and how much in cash the film studios are receiving in return. Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits. The companies that purchase credits at a discount, however, receive the full face value of the credits off their tax bills — so they effectively get a tax break.

Hohman, who opposed a similar proposal in Michigan, added that the confidentiality of these transactions “is a travesty.”

“People should know who's collecting their taxpayer money,” he said.

What the proposal says

Under the proposal likely to come up in this special session — sponsored by Assms. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) — the state starting in 2028 would set aside $120 million in annual transferable tax credits for the industry for the next 15 years, an exponential increase from the existing $10 million annual limit.

Of this pot of money, $95 million would be set aside annually for productions at a yet-to-be-built studio in Las Vegas’ Summerlin community, while the remaining $25 million would be available for productions elsewhere in the state. There’s likely more opportunity for developers to use the tax credits themselves on that larger-scale project.

The base amount of credits that a film production company could receive is 30 percent of all qualified expenses, which can cover anything from set construction to facility leasing. However, that number could be lowered if the company does not hire enough Nevada workers or does not provide sufficient training or work opportunities to underrepresented groups.

An amended version of the bill also put forward new spending requirements for production companies, including investments of $900 million in construction by the end of 2029 and $1.8 billion in capital investment by the end of 2038. If they fail to meet these milestones, the amendment could require a lien be placed against the remaining undeveloped land in an amount equal to the shortfall. Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.

The credits would expire six years after they are issued, an increase from the four-year limit that is in place with the existing program.

Because of this leeway in using the credits, opponents say it could be a pain point for the state budgeting process. If production companies chose to redeem tens of millions of dollars worth of credits in the same year, that would mean less revenue coming into the state, potentially imperiling other initiatives that require state dollars.

“We could see significant [redeeming of credits] during an economic downturn when the state faces its own revenue challenge,” said UNLV economist Michael Brown, the former head of the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/10/70659a9f-studio-union-rally-101525-10.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:58:35.053965

And, while it’s still not too late for many Americans to go solar, contractors in North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona say their 2025 calendars are jammed.

Back in August, EnergySage noted a 205% year-over-year increase in homeowners actively working with solar installers, and observed an all-time high in solar customer inquiries immediately following the passage of the OBBA — a sentiment echoed by installers everywhere.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bryce Bruncati, director of residential sales at 8MSolar in Raleigh, told WFAE in Charlotte. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

In states like Arizona, installers are seeing a similar rush from residents hoping to sneak their systems in under the wire.

“An average system might be around $25,000,” explains Tyler Carlyle, the owner of Bright Home Energy in Phoenix. “You start doing the math, 30% for federal tax credit, $1,000 from state, you’re talking $10,000 in savings by going solar now purchasing the system.”

But more demand means less supply, and running out of solar panels is only one of the issues slowing down lead times, which have been stretching from weeks to months recently, and whether you want to blame that on a lack of federal agents processing imports, a growing trade war limiting the amount of materials contractors can work with, or ongoing the ICE raids that are exacerbating a national construction labor shortage by illegally targeting hardworking Americans because of the color of their skin, the fact remains that many homeowners are eager to lock in the full 30% federal solar tax credit are finding installers short supply, and many installers are scrambling to install systems before the December deadline.

FOMO is real

As we recently discovered, taking advantage of tax credits and saving money are not the primary drivers for home solar adoption among Electrek readers. But while it’s obvious that Electrek readers are objectively better people, that doesn’t mean they don’t like saving money — and the window to do so on a home solar project is rapidly closing.

“Every month you wait puts your incentives at risk,” reads the copy at Florida Power Services. “The permitting process, equipment supply, and installer availability are already creating challenges for homeowners across Pinellas County.”

The site goes on to note that Pinellas County solar installation plan reviews are already delayed more than four weeks, and every week that passes adds to the backlog. “Your system could get stuck in permitting and never make it to installation before incentives expire,” reads the copy. “By starting early, you secure your place in line and give your project the best chance to be completed on time.”

Don’t lose hope, but don’t get stuck

While it may seem like it’s already too late (and, for some of you, it might be), don’t lose hope. Remember that under IRS Form 5695 for systems installed on existing homes, the credit is available in the tax year when the system is “placed in service,” but what exactly that means and whether interconnection or utility “permission to operate” (PTO) is strictly required to meet that “place in service” standard depends on various state and local rulings — and there seems to be plenty of wiggle room in there.

What’s more, I was able to find at least one private-letter IRS ruling said a solar project could qualify as “placed in service” even though utility interconnection (or, “tie-in”) was not yet complete, which could imply that there’s some wiggle room for eligibility baked in at the national level, as well.

As ever, I want to close this one out with a disclaimer and remind you that your favorite journalist (me, obviously) is not an attorney. Especially when it comes to big dollar stuff like this, connect with local experts who do this stuff every day, and maybe consult a tax professional, too, to be on the safe side.

It has a direct influence on construction cost, system sizing, occupant comfort, and building performance and resilience.","The following is a Viewpoint written by Amit Gupta, chief executive at Aeroseal.

As New York prepares to implement its 2026 All-Electric Buildings Act, the transition to clean, efficient electric technologies marks a bold step toward a low-carbon future. Heat pumps and other innovations will redefine how buildings are powered and heated—helping to cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Yet, to fully realize the promise of electrification, attention must also be given to something far less visible: air tightness.

Even the most advanced electric heating and cooling systems can only perform at their peak when the building envelope and ductwork are properly sealed. Air leaks dilute efficiency gains, drive up energy costs, and make it harder to deliver the comfort and performance these systems are designed to achieve.

In July, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council approved the new all-electric standards. When they take effect in 2026, they’ll apply to most new residential buildings seven stories and below and commercial buildings over 100,000 sq ft, expanding in 2029 to include taller residential and smaller commercial buildings.

While the change has been long anticipated—and many in the industry are ready to lead the charge—it brings both opportunities and learning curves. The goal isn’t just compliance; it’s ensuring these buildings are healthy, affordable, and as efficient as possible. Achieving that means pairing electrification with strong air sealing practices so that conditioned air stays where it should, systems run efficiently, and residents enjoy greater comfort.

Professionals across the architect, engineer, and contractor (AEC) community have seen how uncontrolled air leakage can undermine performance—allowing air to move between units or to the outdoors, raising energy use, and forcing oversized mechanical systems. By contrast, sealing those leaks can reduce energy use by more than 30%, enabling smaller, more cost-effective systems that deliver sustained savings and superior comfort.

Electrification is the future of buildings. Air sealing is what ensures that future performs as promised, and the evidence is clear. In a UC Davis-led field demonstration and modeled study of 18 new multifamily homes in Minnesota, aerosol-based envelope sealing resulted in leakage reductions of 67% to 94% and a reduction in heating costs by as much as 25%. Envelope air tightness ranged between 0.2 to 1.4 ACH50, with half of the units exceeding code requirements by more than 80%.

Of course, not all air sealing methods deliver the same results. Traditional hand-applied sealants can be effective, but their reach is limited. Reaching the micro-leaks hidden behind sheathing, framing, or junction boxes is nearly impossible by hand, and once ductwork is behind walls and ceilings, it is completely unattainable without demolition.

Advanced aerosolized sealing technologies can find and seal those leaks automatically, taking the elements of human error and inaccessibility out of the equation. For example, in a U.S. Department of Energy study of 40 residential units in North Carolina, the ductwork in 20 homes was sealed manually and achieved a 59% leakage reduction. The other 20 homes were sealed using Aeroseal’s aerosolized process and achieved a 90% reduction, cutting leakage to roughly 1.5 CFM / 100 ft²—over four-and-a-half times tighter than the manual sealing results of 7.0 CFM/100 ft2. This difference translates directly into smaller, efficient HVAC systems, operating cost savings, and verified performance.

The same dynamic is playing out in projects across the country. On New York’s Upper West Side, progress on the 32-unit 153rd Street Apartments was stalled because the team couldn’t meet Passive House Standard air-tightness requirements—a rigorous, above-code benchmark for building energy efficiency and comfort. Previous manual sealing attempts had been expensive and ineffective. But with advanced envelope air sealing technology, the site sealed all 32 units to the standard in just eight days, enabling the project to move forward.

On a much larger scale, managers of the 600-unit, all-electric Soleil Lofts in Herriman, Utah, wanted to cut energy consumption in half to meet Net Zero performance standards. Units were sealed to 1 ACH50, enabling the use of smaller 1.5-ton VRF heat pumps instead of 3.5-ton gas furnaces. HVAC costs dropped by 50%. And the energy savings made the deployment of rooftop solar economically viable.

Both projects–and hundreds more like them–illustrate a broader truth: air tightness should be treated as a central design and performance factor, not an afterthought. When buildings leak, every other system must work harder. Costs go up. Performance goes down. When buildings are sealed, HVAC loads shrink, renewables become more viable, and residents enjoy lower bills and healthier indoor environments.

As the building industry moves toward all-electric new construction, air tightness should be treated as a core design priority. It has a direct influence on construction cost, system sizing, occupant comfort, and building performance and resilience. For developers, that means recognizing it as an investment that could drive down overall project and long-term operating costs. For the AEC community, it means planning construction timelines and coordination so sealing happens at the right time, leveraging the right technologies to exceed stringent local building standards, emerging code, rigorous certification requirements, and broader performance goals.

For a rapidly evolving industry, the message is clear: the clean-energy transition depends on getting this invisible layer right. By prioritizing advanced sealing techniques, developers and contractors can not only meet New York’s new mandate but also gain an edge in a market that increasingly rewards projects that perform as promised.

Electricity is often channelled to power private utilities, while not delivering on promises of new local jobs. The result is growing public distrust that could derail the energy transition itself.

In Kenya, poor consultation with local communities led to a landmark ruling that revoked the licence for a proposed geothermal project. In India, a 1-gigawatt (GW) solar project funded by the Asian Development Bank was cancelled in 2025 after protests by tribal communities, who reported a lack of proper consultation and faced the displacement of 20,000 people.

In Chile, wind farms built for green hydrogen exports are meeting resistance as residents say such projects threaten ecosystems and livelihoods. In the Philippines, the Tumandok Indigenous people oppose a mega-hydropower project. They say the project risks flooding their ancestral lands and sacred sites, and has violated their right to free, prior and informed consent. And in Pakistan, the 4-GW Dasu Hydropower Project has already uprooted more than 7,000 people, leaving 34 villages abandoned.

With clean energy mega-projects becoming the norm, as shown in a recent report by CAN International, such conflicts are only likely to increase in number unless things change.

Growth without justice

Despite record expansion, deployment of renewables remains far too slow and far too unequal. Many developing countries are constrained by debt and limited fiscal space, while rich nations continue to over-consume energy.

Even where renewables are rising, the benefits often flow to foreign corporations. And power fed back into national grids frequently enriches independent power producers while leaving consumers with high bills.

For Indian women workers, a just transition means surviving climate impacts with dignity

Egypt illustrates the dilemma. To meet its green hydrogen targets and bring in hard currency to service its debt, the country needs to install 41 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and 114 GW by 2040 – five to fifteen times its current renewable capacity. Four percent of Egypt’s land has been designated for green hydrogen production, even as droughts and water scarcity worsen.

Under the EU-led Global Gateway initiative, some of this electricity could be exported to Europe through the GREGY interconnector. Meanwhile, Egypt is becoming a hub for ‘green’ data centres, even as rural areas and public healthcare facilities face rolling blackouts.

“Some of the world’s largest solar projects are in Morocco and Egypt – but they’re built mainly for export, not to meet domestic needs,” says Mohamed Kamal, executive director of Greenish, an Egypt-based civil society organisation. “The real challenge now is governance: how to ensure that new investments serve local people first, especially in regions that still lack the infrastructure for consistent energy supply.”

“As we build the renewable energy economy, we must not repeat the mistakes of the fossil fuel era,” he adds. “We cannot look to those failed models for inspiration or replicate their structures of control within the renewable energy value chain.”

A just transition mechanism for renewables at COP30

At COP30 in Belém, civil society networks including Climate Action Network are calling for the Belém Action Mechanism (BAM) for a Just Transition under the UN climate process to make a fair transition real.

COP30 could confront “glaring gap” in clean energy agenda: mining

BAM would bring together the many initiatives now working in isolation, from practitioner alliances to community projects or programmes led by intergovernmental organisations. This will help countries change course by removing structural barriers such as debt, unfair trade rules and limited technology transfer that keep developing countries at the bottom of renewable supply chains.

It will also unlock public finance to support worker upskilling, green industrial policies and inclusive ownership models and distributed renewable systems. Furthermore, it can create structured dialogue between governments, workers and communities to share best practices, strengthen participation and scale up solutions that deliver.

Such a mechanism could help countries develop not only more renewables, but better ones – people-centred, community-led and domestically owned.

Restoring trust, accelerating transition

Globally, the world is not on track to triple renewable capacity by 2030 – as agreed at COP28 – and fossil fuel emissions remain stubbornly high. Unless the renewable transition becomes fairer, it will also become slower.

From rooftop-solar schemes in India that cut bills and spare land, to initiatives in the Philippines, where a coalition of civil society, faith-based and industry groups has launched a “Ten Million Solar Rooftops” challenge, examples are emerging across the world of what fair, people-centred renewables can look like.

In Canada and Australia, projects led by communities or Indigenous people are showing the same spirit. In Western Australia, the Aalga Goorlil “Sun Turtle” Community Power Project – led by the Djarindjin Aboriginal Corporation – aims to reduce the community’s reliance on non-renewable energy and has already become a symbol of self-determination since the community’s official recognition last year. In Bolivia, solar power is strengthening food and economic security for local farming and fishing communities.

Self-taught mechanics give second life to Jordan’s glut of spent EV batteries

A global just transition mechanism could scale up such efforts, restoring trust and placing equity at the centre of decarbonisation and access to quality energy for everyone.

“Justice isn’t an add-on,” says Mohamed Kamal. “It’s the condition for progress. Without it, the transition won’t hold.” As negotiators prepare for COP30, the question is not only how fast the world can build renewables, but who they are built for and how.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/CHN-pic-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:58:28.176169

When Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina in September of 2024, many of our projects and clients were immediately impacted. In the Town of Burnsville, the hurricane caused a significant infrastructure failure, leaving the town’s water system crippled. Floodwater washed away 2,200 linear feet of influent piping and the raw water pumps supplying the treatment plant. Knowing the critical risks involved with these infrastructure issues, Harper teams mobilized immediately alongside local engineers, trade partners, and town officials.

Harper’s team worked quickly to engineer and install a temporary two-stage diesel pump system, restoring 950 gallons per minute of flow to the treatment plant. This was achieved despite working over steep terrain and through ongoing storm impacts. A second phase added a hybrid electric-diesel backup system, powered by a custom transformer, to adapt the town’s single-phase grid to the three-phase power required for the pumps.

“Coordinating the logistics to reach the location with the necessary equipment and materials was a significant task that required collaboration,” stated Kate Dotten-Holder PE, Charlotte Regional Director. “We are grateful to United Rentals, Cooper Sand and Gravel, and Charles Underwood for their support. It is incredible to have trade partners who were just as eager to help us restore water service.”

Within a week of landfall, clean water was flowing again. Crews also cleared fallen trees, reopened driveways, and delivered food, fuel, and heating supplies to residents.

Finance

Adequate quality climate finance is critical to closing the ambition gap and turning climate commitments into real action on the ground. At COP30, countries must adopt a credible Baku-to-Belém Roadmap to reach the USD 1.3 trillion finance goal agreed at COP29. The Roadmap should speak to relevant actors and highlight relevant reforms to ensure climate finance is high quality and reaches the most vulnerable countries without exacerbating debt, and inequalities

COP30 must underscore the moral imperative and obligation of historic emitters to support vulnerable nations. And the type of finance matters deeply. Grants and concessional finance should form the backbone of climate finance to support vulnerable nations, especially for adaptation and loss and damage action.

Julius Mbatia, global climate justice programme manager with ACT Alliance, says: “Alternative and innovative financing does not replace the legal obligations of developed countries to provide finance to address the climate crisis in developing vulnerable nations. Private financing cannot just flow on its own nor can it replace the role of public finance and interventions. The responsibility of developed countries to provide international public finance must be delivered to bridge the financing gap and mobilize additional quality finance.”

Mitigation and NDCs

The climate crisis is accelerating and continues to hit the most vulnerable communities hardest, especially in regions where ACT Alliance members work. Africa, for example, contributes only 4% of global emissions yet faces some of the most severe climate impacts. Meanwhile, the world’s largest emitters, responsible for about 80% of global emissions, must make deep and rapid cuts.

Current national climate plans (NDCs) are not enough to keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C within reach. According to the 2025 NDC Synthesis Report, countries’ latest pledges would reduce emissions by only 17% by 2035. This is far below the roughly 60% reduction needed to maintain a viable path to 1.5°C.

ACT Alliance will advocate for major emitting countries to treat their current NDC commitments as the baseline, not the ceiling, and to clearly outline how they will increase ambition in the next NDC cycle. Further, the alliance will advocate to remind parties that the implementation of NDCs as commitments cannot set us on the pathway below 1.5 degrees unless they are acted on.

Mattias Söderberg, Global Climate Lead at DanChurchAid, says: “The world is sleepwalking toward a dangerous future. We cannot solve the climate crisis by avoiding its cause. Fossil fuels must be part of the discussion if we are serious about protecting people and the planet.”

Adaptation

For too long, adaptation efforts have been underfunded and overlooked. Nearly half the world’s population already lives in highly climate-vulnerable hotspots, yet progress on financing, planning, and implementation remains far behind.

At COP30, our priorities include boosting support for adaptation through the Baku to Belém Roadmap and ensuring the successful adoption of the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), one of the conference’s key deliverables. GGA indicators to enable transparent, measurable, and globally comparable tracking of adaptation efforts.

Means of Implementation (finance, technology transfer and capacity-building support) is a fundamental inclusion in GGA indicators. Adaptation progress must not be judged solely by national efforts but also by the adequacy of international cooperation and support provided to enable action. ACT Alliance believes that time is right to double down on adaptation support by setting a new and ambitious adaptation finance target beyond 2025

Data must inform action, not create reporting burdens for vulnerable countries. GGA indicators should fundamentally highlight what is already being implemented on the ground, identify where additional support is needed, and highlight gaps where action is insufficient. It should lead in increased action, not just mere reporting.

Loss and Damage

The new climate finance target agreed at COP29 did not include L&D as a subgoal. The COP30 Presidency is not prioritising L&D posing a serious risk to sideline it in future negotiations. The Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), a UNFCCC fund, is operational but yet to disburse any funds. This is alarming.

The FRLD must be filled and bring justice to the frontline climate impacted people. Its resource mobilisation strategy, which was expected to be adopted by 2025 and delayed now, must be adopted with the objective of ‘escalating’ FRLD’s contribution to responding to loss and damage in the developing countries through contributions from a wide variety of resources of funding, including grants and concessional loans from public, private and innovative sources.

Grants should be prioritised as the primary financial instrument to capitalise and replenish the FRLD, ensuring it meets the scale and pace of needs in the Global South. The FRLD should focus on grant provision only during its start-up phase, with the first disbursements scheduled for 2025–2026 under the Barbados Implementation Mechanism.

Nushrat Chowdhury of Christian Aid says: ‘’It remains disappointing that the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage does not have sufficient funding, pledges are far below the estimated loss and damage needs in developing countries and even the full pledged money has not yet been paid in. Amidst this, the fund is forced to resource mobilize as developed countries push back on providing resources to the fund.’’

Gender

COP29 ended with a decision to extend the Lima Work Program on Gender for an additional ten years. In Bonn, negotiations started to work on the content of the new Gender Action Plan. These negotiations will continue in Belem with a view to adopt a new GAP by the end of the COP30. This new GAP must usher in a new phase in building a climate framework that treats gender equality not merely as a guiding principle, but as a fundamental prerequisite for inclusive, effective, equitable, and transformative climate action.

Elena Cedillo, program executive for climate justice with the Lutheran World Federation, says: ‘’COP30 must send a clear signal for a gender-just climate action, and to explicitly refer to and incorporate key GAP components in NDCs and NAPs, including to collect and use gender-disaggregated data and to use gender markers, and gender budgeting.”

Just transition

Building on the outcomes of the GST in 2023, COP30 must continue to emphasise the need for a fair and equitable phase-out of fossil fuels. Simply including fossil fuel language in the final text is not enough. What is needed is a commitment to justice in the energy transition, balancing responsibility and capability, and on fostering real economic transformation. The world’s largest emitters, primarily the richest countries, must lead by reducing emissions drastically by 2035, and achieving net-zero by 2050, and providing support to middle-income countries to follow soon after. Poorer nations should transition at a pace aligned with their capacities and national circumstances, receiving full financial, technical, and capacity-building support to decarbonize their economies and implement NDCs while ensuring access to clean energy and poverty eradication in their countries.

ACT Alliance members will advocate for elimination of fossil-fuels subsidies and fossil fuel phase-out pathways that go hand-in-hand with the Just transition principles. At COP30,The JTWP must champion people-oriented and rights-based transition pathways and Developed countries must commit to investing in and expanding energy access through decentralised renewable energy systems that create local jobs, empower women and youth, and deliver clean power to off-grid communities. Public finance should take the lead in driving this transition to prevent the accumulation of unsustainable debt, and these commitments must be firmly embedded within the Baku to Belém Roadmap.",https://actalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSCF5605-700x467.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:58:37.101400

Delegates from over 190 countries, NGOs, Indigenous representatives, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, alongside COP President André Corrêa do Lago, will all participate in this year's high-stakes climate negotiations.

Missed Targets and Weak Ambition: It's Now or Never

With 2024 confirmed as the hottest year ever on record, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and the massive financial shortfalls left by lackluster negotiations at COP29, this year's climate talks are pivotal.

A 2024 report by the UN revealed that current policies put the planet on track to reach a catastrophic 3.1°C warming by 2100 (Emissions Gap Report). This scenario would expose 600 million people to flooding, reduce food yields by half, cause severe water shortages, lead to insurmountable habitat and biodiversity loss, create month-long brutal heatwaves and wildfires, heighten the risks of insect-borne diseases, and profoundly deepen inequalities.

Progress will be stalled unless the global climate investment gap can be closed and pledges are finally turned into real investments.

At last year's summit, it was agreed that at least $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance would be mobilized for developing countries by 2035. This funding is intended to support a just transition to clean energy, climate adaptation policies, and addressing loss and damage from climate change.

Tackling the climate crisis is IMPOSSIBLE without adequate funding. Since President Donald Trump took office, at least $18 billion has been stripped from climate finance—6% of the new global $300 billion annual target. The current pace of financing is entirely insufficient to meet the agreed-upon goals.

At COP30, all members of the UNCCC are expected to publish their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining their national plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate impacts.

The NDC Synthesis Report was released in October 2025, which, according to Melanie Robinson, global climate, economics, and finance program director for World Resources Institute, ""lays bare a frightening gap between what governments have promised and what is needed to protect people and planet.""

Progress will be stalled unless the global climate investment gap can be closed and pledges are finally turned into real investments. This will prove even more difficult as militarization grips the planet. NATO has increased its spending commitments to an unprecedented 5% of GDP, and the EU Special Debts for Rearmament will further siphon money into warmongering, posturing, and weapons stockpiling.

A new initiative, the Global Ethical Stocktake, launched by the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, and the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, aims to integrate ethical considerations into climate negotiations, an aspect that has previously been omitted.

Jaded by a lack of action in previous COPs, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, along with other influential figures such as Mary Robinson and Christiana Figueres, labelled the current climate policy process ""no longer fit for purpose.""

Finally, a COP President with Credentials: André Corrêa do Lago

This year's COP president holds higher hopes than others. He is a veteran climate diplomat and serves as the current secretary for climate, energy, and environment at the Brazilian Ministry of External Affairs.

He has worked with Brazil's diplomatic corps since 1982 and has represented Brazil in similar negotiations, including as chief negotiator at Rio+20, COP28, and COP29.

In a positive initial call to action, he has called on all stakeholders in the climate negotiations process to ""act decisively in the face of climate urgency through an ambitious and integrated Action Agenda at COP30.""

A COP Built on Deforestation: Brazil Controversy

The location of this year's climate summit is highly contentious. Destroying thousands of acres of rainforest to make way for a new four-lane highway, which is intended to ease congestion for COP visitors, is a blatant contradiction. This is the very environment Brazil has pledged to protect.

Rather than addressing the concerns, classic greenwashing terms like 'sustainable"" are being used to describe the 8-mile road. Cutting through the Amazon rainforest, the road will fragment the ecosystem, disrupt the movement of wildlife, affect the livelihoods of local communities, and be inaccessible to those who live on either side of the highway. It will, however, have bike lanes and solar-powered lights!

The lack of infrastructure in the area means that more than 30 large-scale construction projects will be taking place to accommodate and prepare for the 50,000 expected visitors. The port is being redeveloped for cruise ships, and $81 million will be spent on expanding the airport to double its current capacity.

Emissions, emissions, emissions!

The expansion of the fossil fuel industry seriously contradicts the Brazilian government's climate narrative and threatens the country's credibility at COP30.

After three climate conferences in countries with restrictions on protests, Amazonian leaders and social movements are wary that their participation may be discounted and silenced. Since February, Indigenous groups have been occupying the Secretary of Education and blocking roads that cut through their territories. The protests have already begun.

Brazil is also no climate leader, but rather an empire built on oil. Its vast mining, fossil fuel, and agribusiness sectors mean that Brazil is responsible for more than 4% of total global emissions. In 2023, it emitted 2.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases, making Brazil the world's fifth worst polluter.

In this country of deep inequalities, the poor are disproportionately affected by climate change, including sea-level rise; heatwaves; and heavy, erratic rainfalls.

Just weeks before the conference begins, a new bill to dismantle Brazil's environmental license framework was passed. It eases restrictions on oil exploration and road development in the Amazon. A self-licensing process enables fossil fuel and construction companies to act with impunity and avoid the need for impact studies and mitigation measures.

Immediately after the bill change, Petrobras, the country's majority state-owned, scandal-ridden oil company, began drilling for oil a mere 200 miles away from Belém. The license was previously denied due to the risk of widespread biodiversity loss in this fragile ecosystem in the event of a spill. A new report reveals that since 2024, big banks have provided $2 billion in new financing for oil and gas in the Amazon.

Estimates suggest that up to 60 billion barrels of oil may exist in the Brazilian Amazon. If burned, they could emit 24 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide—more than Brazil's emissions over the past 11 years. The expansion of the fossil fuel industry seriously contradicts the Brazilian government's climate narrative and threatens the country's credibility at COP30.

Key vesting targets emphasize Full Self-Driving software, Robotaxi networks, Optimus humanoid robots, and Megapack energy storage, projecting trillions in value from high-margin, non-automotive innovations.

With strong shareholder approval, the package underscores investor belief in Tesla as a Silicon Valley disruptor, eclipsing traditional automakers and aiming for a $10 trillion enterprise by 2035.

In a move that underscores the audacious ambitions of one of the world’s most polarizing CEOs, Tesla (TSLA) shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a compensation package for Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion, vesting over the next decade if the company meets a series of escalating performance milestones. This isn’t merely a reward for steering Tesla through its electric vehicle dominance; it’s a resounding endorsement of the company’s pivot from a car manufacturer to a multifaceted technology powerhouse, betting everything on artificial intelligence, robotics, and energy innovation. At a time when Tesla’s automotive sales face intensifying competition from legacy automakers and Chinese rivals, this package crystallizes the investor conviction that the firm’s future valuation – projected to balloon into the trillions – lies in disruptive tech ecosystems, not assembly lines.

The sheer magnitude of the deal speaks volumes. Structured as 12 tranches of stock options, the package could grant Musk up to 25% of Tesla’s equity, or roughly 423.7 million shares, contingent on hitting targets that propel the company’s market cap from its current $1.43T/$432.03 levels toward unprecedented heights. Unlike traditional CEO pay tied to quarterly earnings or unit sales, Musk’s incentives are calibrated for exponential growth: revenue thresholds in the hundreds of billions, production ramps for non-vehicle products, and operational benchmarks in AI deployment. For context, his previous 2018 package – once the largest in history at $56 billion – fueled Tesla’s EV surge but fell short of fully capturing the robotics and autonomy visions. This new iteration escalates the stakes, requiring Tesla to grow by trillions in enterprise value, a feat unattainable through cars alone, where global EV penetration is projected to plateau below 50% by 2030 according to industry forecasts.

Central to this transformation is Tesla’s aggressive foray into AI and autonomy. The pay package’s milestones explicitly hinge on advancements in Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and the Robotaxi network, which Musk has positioned as the company’s “next big thing.” With FSD subscriptions already generating recurring revenue – outpacing hardware sales in some quarters – these technologies promise a software-like margin profile, potentially 90% gross margins versus the 20-30% from vehicles. Investors aren’t rewarding Musk for building more Model Ys; they’re compensating him for orchestrating a fleet of millions of autonomous vehicles that could monetize through ride-hailing, data licensing, and even urban planning integrations. Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer, designed to train AI models on petabytes of real-world driving data, further cements this shift, positioning the company as a direct competitor to Nvidia (NVDA) in AI hardware.

Robotics amplifies the signal. The Optimus humanoid robot, unveiled as a factory worker but eyed for consumer applications, represents Tesla’s bid to capture the $10 trillion labor automation market by 2040. Package vesting requires scaling Optimus production to thousands of units annually, integrating it with Tesla’s AI stack for tasks from warehouse logistics to household assistance. This isn’t ancillary; Musk has stated that robotics could eclipse automotive revenue within five years, a claim now baked into his trillion-dollar upside. Energy storage rounds out the triad: Megapack deployments for grid-scale batteries have already hit record deployments in 2025, with milestones demanding gigawatt-hour outputs that rival entire national power sectors. These segments – AI, bots, energy – collectively drove 40% of Tesla’s valuation premium in recent analyst models, far outstripping its 2 million annual vehicle deliveries.

Critics may decry the package as executive excess, especially amid Tesla’s recent profit dips from price wars. Yet, with 75% shareholder approval, the vote reflects a calculated risk: Musk’s track record of defying odds, from reusable rockets to neural interfaces, justifies aligning his wealth to Tesla’s moonshot aspirations. Traditional automakers like Ford (F) or GM (GM) cap CEO pay at $20 – 30 million annually, tethered to finite markets. Tesla’s board, by contrast, has engineered a mechanism that vests fully only if the company transcends Detroit’s playbook, achieving 25% founder control to ward off activist dilution.

By 2035, when the package matures, Tesla could command a $10 trillion enterprise if these bets pay off – dwarfing Apple’s (AAPL) current scale through a constellation of AI-driven services. The $1 trillion payout isn’t hubris; it’s a litmus test for Tesla’s reinvention. Gone are the days of it being “just a car company.” This is the compensation architecture of a Silicon Valley titan, rewarding the architect of tomorrow’s intelligent economy. Investors, it seems, are all in.

Covering Katy News was first to report in March that Tesla was locating its Megapack battery manufacturing facility in Brookshire after Waller County Commissioners Court and the Brookshire City Council approved tax abatement agreements.

The Waller County Commissioners Court approved the tax abatement agreement on Wednesday, March 5, followed by the Brookshire City Council's approval on Thursday, March 6.

Tesla Plans 1,500 Jobs by 2028 in Waller County

Tesla has committed to employing at least 375 people at the facility in Empire West Business Park by the end of 2026, according to the company's tax abatement agreement with Waller County Commissioners Court. That figure increases to at least 750 by the end of 2027 and at least 1,500 by the end of 2028. Tesla must maintain at least 1,500 employees through the remainder of the 10-year abatement period, which begins Jan. 1, 2026.

The Austin-based electric vehicle manufacturer expects to pay more than $1 billion in employee salaries over the 10-year period.

What Tesla Will Manufacture in Brookshire

The Empire West industrial park is located on Woods Road between Highway 90 and Interstate 10, a short distance from Katy.

During a March commissioners court meeting, a Tesla representative said the company plans to replicate its Lathrop, California, facility, which manufactures utility-scale batteries called Megapacks. The California facility produces 10,000 Megapacks annually, equal to 40 gigawatt hours of energy storage.

Tesla Megapacks are used to store electricity for large renewable energy projects which are not consistent producers of power. Solar does not produce energy at night when it's dark, and wind energy does not produce electricity when the wind isn't blowing and the turbines aren't spinning. Tesla's Megapacks store power for use during times when renewable energy sources aren't generating electricity.

Tesla's $200 Million Investment in Empire West Business Park

Tesla will lease two buildings in Empire West Business Park, which is being developed by Dallas-based Stream Realty Partners. The company leased the 1.04 million-square-foot Building 9 in 2022, though a third party was occupying the building as of March.

Under the tax abatement agreement, Tesla will spend $44 million on improvements to Building 9, located at 111 Empire Blvd., and approximately $150 million on manufacturing equipment including automated robotic welding cells, robotic assembly stations, automatic conveyors and gantry trains.

Tesla also plans to lease Building 10, which has not yet been constructed. The 616,463-square-foot building will be located at 103 Empire Blvd. Stream will spend $31.5 million on improvements to Building 10, while Tesla plans to spend approximately $5 million on warehouse equipment.

Tax Abatement Agreement Details

Tesla will receive tax abatements of 60% on the value of the improvements and buildings from both Waller County and the city of Brookshire.

""This is another excellent example of our spec building program, which has been used by Waller County since 2010 to attract new investment to the area,"" Yokom said. ""Brookshire also implemented a similar program for Stream Realty to expand Empire West.""

Stream Realty built the so-called ""spec"" building at its Empire West business park with no tenant on speculation that it would attract jobs and economic development. Stream will also oversee the construction of the new 600,000-square-foot distribution facility with some manufacturing capabilities. When completed, Tesla will occupy both buildings.

The deal has been developing for months, but Tesla has held the lease on the building since October 2021 where third-party logistics company DB Schenker handled Tesla parts. Schenker will be moving out, and Tesla will be moving into that building which will be used to manufacture Tesla's Megapacks.

This expansion follows Tesla's headquarters relocation from California to Texas in December 2021, after opening its 4 million-plus-square-foot Gigafactory in Austin.

Brookshire Emerging as Clean Energy Manufacturing Hub

The Brookshire area has attracted several clean energy manufacturing operations recently. TMEIC Corp. Americas broke ground this year on its third manufacturing facility in Brookshire, a 267,000-square-foot plant on a 20-acre site that will produce uninterruptible-power supplies and medium-voltage drives.

Turkey-based solar manufacturer Elin Energy moved into a 225,000-square-foot facility in Twinwood Business Park, and international water pump manufacturer Grundfos is more than doubling its production capacity in Brookshire. Indian solar panel manufacturer Waaree also has a presence in Waller County near Brookshire.

""This was a great partnership effort between Waller County and the city of Brookshire. I want to thank Joe Esch, who represented Brookshire and currently oversees the city's economic development program. He was instrumental in making the deal a success,"" Yokom said.",https://coveringkaty.com/downloads/3332/download/Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%206.58.56%E2%80%AFAM.png?cb=98efd65a7fb56c8f2b30f9fb5a6e1301&w=934,N,,2025-11-09 13:18:53.000694

Gov. Josh Shapiro and lawmakers negotiating a spending plan are tight-lipped about what is and isn't on the table. But Republicans, who control the state Senate and have rejected Democratic budget proposals, have staunchly opposed the carbon reduction program.

Now, environmentalists claim, Senate Republicans are refusing to act on a budget as schools and social programs desperately wait for state funding until Shapiro and Democratic lawmakers agree to repeal the regulations entering Pennsylvania into RGGI.

""As the governor himself has often said, this is a false choice between a healthy environment and our economy, and now our environmental champions in Harrisburg, many of whom are standing behind me today, must resist,"" Molly Parzens, executive director of Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Thursday.

A spokesperson for Shapiro said Thursday his office would not comment on budget negotiations. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman's (R-Indiana) office did not respond to a request for comment.

RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade.

It has cut carbon emissions from power plants in half by placing an enforceable declining cap on the amount of climate pollution that fossil fuel power plants are allowed to emit. Participating states have seen more than $9 billion in investments and it's projected that consumers will save $20 billion in energy costs as a result.

Former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered Pennsylvania into the program in 2019 by executive order. Republicans, who controlled both chambers of the General Assembly at the time, argued it infringed on their legislative authority and argued it amounts to an illegal tax on energy.

The state Supreme Court heard arguments last May from the Shapiro administration that controlling carbon emissions is within the state Department of Environmental Protection's broad authority to control air pollution. Lawyers for Senate Republicans said the regulations encroach into policy decisions about the state's energy economy that are the domain of lawmakers, not the executive branch.

A decision in the case could come at any time.

Robert Routh, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at the news conference in Philadelphia that withdrawing from RGGI before the court's decision would be shortsighted, as the decision will not abrogate the administration's ability to regulate emissions.

""Regardless of how the court rules, the Supreme Court decision will affect how Pennsylvania can design rules to control climate pollution under the Air Pollution Control Act, not whether the state can do so,"" Routh said.

""And there is, of course, the possibility that the court finds in favor of RGGI, upholds the constitutionality of the rule as currently designed, and delivers a massive victory for Pennsylvanians that will lower costs, cut pollution and create jobs,"" Routh said. ""I urge people to recognize that giving away this possibility at the goal line would be a costly mistake.""

On the 100th day of the impasse last month, House Minority Leader Jesse Topper, R-Bedford, told reporters that budget discussions were outside the realm of economic reality in Pennsylvania. GOP lawmakers have objected to Shapiro's proposal to spend down the state's budget surplus and dip into its $7 billion rainy day fund, arguing that doing so ignores a structural deficit.

To avoid that, the state needs sustained economic growth, and Topper argued the way to achieve that is by unleashing Pennsylvania's fossil fuel resources.

""What we have underneath our feet in terms of natural resources would make any state in the union green with envy, and yet we continue to miss our opportunities,"" Topper said, arguing that RGGI is the cause of instability in the state's energy markets.

""We have to get out of RGGI once and for all,"" he said, noting House Republicans planned to file a discharge motion to force a floor vote on the Senate's bill to repeal RGGI regulations.

The same day, House Democrats ratched up pressure on Senate GOP leaders before passing a $50.6 billion spending plan, in a response to the Senate's flat funding proposal in July. Majority Leader Matt Bradford, D-Montgomery, told reporters that Democrats were willing to compromise on ""every single issue.""

""There are 102 Democrats that would be heartbroken by almost every one of those compromises, but we will do them because government must be open and it must work,"" Bradford said.

Asked whether the openness to compromise extended to the Senate RGGI bill, Bradford acknowledged two areas where his caucus would not budget. One, he said, was taxpayer funded private school tuition vouchers.

The other: ""No, we're not getting out of RGGI without taking care of our environment, period full stop.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/pennsylvania_climate_budget.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:58:42.438984

New York Governor Kathy Hochul finally relented and on Friday handed a major award for Tulsa-based Williams Cos.to see light at the end of the day as it seeks approval for a 24-mile pipeline to supply New York City with natural gas.

She signed a permit advancing the the Northeast Supply Enhancement line, a total reversal of her previous rejections of the project. Williams had previously been denied twice its requests for approval of the line. The company secured what are known as Clean Water Action 401 and 404 permits from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and a Section 401 Water Quality Certification and related permits from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

“We’re proud to move NESE forward and do our part in providing New Yorkers access to clean, reliable and affordable natural gas,” said Chad Zamarin, president and CEO of Williams. “This project reflects our commitment to deliver clean and reliable energy, while lowering energy costs and supporting economic growth and environmental stewardship.”

“As Governor, a top priority is making sure the lights and heat stay on for all New Yorkers as we face potential energy shortages downstate as soon as next summer,” Hochul said in a statement, according to multiple reports. “We need to govern in reality. We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.”

The NESE project is designed to improve energy affordability and reliability in New York City by expanding access to critical natural gas infrastructure and displacing high-emitting and costly fuel oil, which is delivered into New York City by diesel trucks. NESE will enhance energy security, lower costs, and reduce emissions, and the project is expected to generate over $1 billion in investment, create thousands of construction-related jobs, and deliver long-term benefits to New York residents and commercial energy users.

In parallel, Williams continues to advance the Constitution Pipeline project, a pipeline in upstate New York that will serve markets in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Maine. The company has withdrawn its current water permit application with NYSDEC and is preparing to follow up with additional filings to ensure that this critical infrastructure project obtains the regulatory approvals needed for construction and operation.

“There is increasing recognition that energy affordability directly impacts everyday affordability,” said Zamarin. “Natural gas is one of our nation’s lowest-cost resources, with U.S. natural gas produced at a cost equivalent to less than 50 cents per gallon of gasoline. Expanding natural gas infrastructure is vital to lowering costs and increasing economic opportunity, and the NESE and Constitution projects are important to connecting energy to opportunity in the Northeast.”

The NESE project is designed to meet market needs of New York, providing $1.8 billion in economic development, delivering gas to 2.3 million homes, and reducing CO2 emissions by over 13,000 tons per year; equivalent to removing 2,800 cars from the road each year. NESE also supports over 3,000 jobs and generates millions in gross state product (GSP) and state tax revenues for the state. During the construction phase of the project, the state of New Jersey will experience an increase in economic activity, including direct and indirect job creation and an increase in state and local tax revenue.

Constitution is designed to provide low-cost, low-emissions energy supply to the Northeast to support economic growth and energy affordability across the region. According to a new S&P Global study, Constitution would generate up to $11.6 Billion in total savings by lowering natural gas prices in the Northeast and support nearly 2,000 jobs annually over a 15-year period. The study also finds that energy savings from the pipeline could stimulate up to $4.4 billion in additional GSP across Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island and could generate $432 million in federal and state tax revenues.

The project has been hotly contested by some Congressional New York Democrats, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and others urging Hochul to consider the environmental impacts of the pipeline on Oct. 15.

Hochul’s decision to finally approve the line came after President Trump bashed her over a delay on the permits.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England.","The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

Danger signs

The planet’s annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.

Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia’s Siberia.

Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.

Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan,China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.

Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That’s the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.

Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world’s seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it’s enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.

Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.

Success in bending the curve

But there’s also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.

Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.

“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. “You cannot hold back the tides.”

In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.

But that’s nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement’s overarching goal.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,” Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.”

A report examining dozens of indicators of progress — such as solar and wind power installations — in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.

The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.

“Technologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,” said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. “But it’s not nearly fast enough for what’s needed.”

Pollution keeps growing

Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.

Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China’s going up 15.5% and India’s soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.

Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. “Unfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can’t say it’s failed. But then nor can you say it’s dramatically succeeded.”

But if it is more expensive than cleaner alternatives, its share of the electricity mix will decline on its own.
This approach will end the volatile pendulum that has characterized coal policy (and energy policy as a whole) over the past decades.
While punitive rules on coal should be repealed, reasonable regulations can still play an important role in coal policy.
By 2021, coal plants' mercury emissions were about 90 percent lower than pre-MATS level along with significant reductions from other hazardous air pollutants.","Policymakers shaping America's coal policy can learn something important from the 2025 economics Nobel Prize winners about creative destruction, the process by which new technologies replace older ones through innovation. Just as smartphones overtook flip phones and cars displaced horses, such progress has improved our daily lives.

Instead of government subsidizing or transitioning away from coal, America should let companies develop new energy technologies that can freely compete with -- and potentially replace -- coal energy to power homes and businesses.

This obvious concept should be universally welcomed. If coal is reliable and affordable, it will continue to power our grid. But if it is more expensive than cleaner alternatives, its share of the electricity mix will decline on its own.

This approach will end the volatile pendulum that has characterized coal policy (and energy policy as a whole) over the past decades. The same government levers used to wage war on coal, along with other fossil fuel energy sources, are then used to subsidize them when political leadership changes.

While allocating trillion-dollar subsidies to preferred green energy industries, the Biden administration tried to eliminate coal through punitive regulations such as the requirement for coal plants to capture 90 percent of their carbon emissions by 2032. This impossible standard would have forced nearly all coal plants into retirement.

The Trump administration was correct to propose repealing these burdensome rules and open 13 million acres of federal land for coal development. But it went further by providing $625 million in subsidies for coal plants, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided a tax subsidy for metallurgical coal.

Though the subsidies are not long-term solutions, Trump's actions were understandable responses to New Green Deal proponents who attempted to phase out fossil fuel while subsidizing wind and solar, destabilizing the grid. Many U.S. regions are at ""elevated risk,"" which means that electricity shortfall can occur in extreme conditions, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Washington can put an end to this partisan battle over coal by embracing this approach rooted in creative destruction, free of subsidies and excessive regulations.

While punitive rules on coal should be repealed, reasonable regulations can still play an important role in coal policy. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule protects the environment. By 2021, coal plants' mercury emissions were about 90 percent lower than pre-MATS level along with significant reductions from other hazardous air pollutants.

Policymakers could also remove government barriers that hinder other energy sources from competing freely with coal. For example, rather than blocking permits for natural gas pipelines that deliver cleaner fuel, states could approve such projects. New York can cooperate with the Trump administration to advance the 125-mile Constitutional and 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement pipelines that were previously rejected. Other projects such as transmission line expansions and power plants should be able to advance under an efficient permitting process.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled back many green energy tax credits, but the legislation failed to repeal completely the clean electricity credits that drive renewable deployment. Congress should complete the task of repealing all energy subsidies.

Meanwhile, competition between energy producers will determine coal's role in the power mix. If emerging technologies like large-scale battery systems outperform coal, its decline simply means that America has found better ways to power homes and businesses. This possible scenario may lead to job losses in the coal industry, but it also creates new opportunities in innovative energy sectors.

Coal continues to have an important place in our energy mix domestically and globally. It provides 15 percent of total American electricity generation. Globally, coal has been the leading source of electricity production for over 50 years. Its instrumental role in energy supply and economic progress in the past and present may not continue, but its future should be determined not by government but by competition.

But this bill would virtually assure that all viable, affordable, and reliable energy sources - including nuclear power and natural gas - remain in the nations energy mix.
Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.
Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.","While the House of Representatives has understandably been quiet during the government shutdown, not everyone has been idle.

While most members of Congress were home in their districts, Rep. Troy Balderson, an Ohio Republican, quietly introduced a short, potentially consequential piece of energy legislation called ""The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act.""

""We the People"" will celebrate our nations 250th birthday next Independence Day. And truth be told, we are crossing this milestone birthday showing our age. We are politically bipolar. We are in debt. Our infrastructure is crumbling and our schools are a mess. We are in need of several new leases on life.

For starters, if America is to be made great again - by anyones definition - it will require a commonsense reordering of our approach to energy and electricity generation. Troy Baldersons approach offers the kind of clear-eyed vision we need.

Aimed as a corrective to the ""Green New Deal"" priorities that took hold during the Biden administration, the ARC would direct federal agencies to reorder their policies with attainable objectives aimed at increasing attainable and cost-effective domestic energy production - and providing benchmarks allowing for effective congressional oversight.

The bill would formally require government regulators to prioritize these three words when evaluating energy projects: Is it affordable? Is it reliable? Is it clean? Most politicians give lip-service to these concepts, but under current law they are left open to interpretation by the executive branch and they shift from one administration to the next, Balderson points out. His bill would essentially codify a true ""all of the above"" energy approach - and would benefit all Americans regardless of their ideological leanings.

If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, his legislation would require the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress within 180 days documenting what they are doing to incorporate all-of-the-above into our national energy strategy. Windmills and solar farms wouldnt be suddenly sidelined. (On the other end of the energy scale, neither would coal.) But this bill would virtually assure that all viable, affordable, and reliable energy sources - including nuclear power and natural gas - remain in the nations energy mix. In other words, it replaces old habits and ideological fads with practicality as a way of supporting American families and businesses.

I dont question liberals commitment to a cleaner environment. But Democrats campaigned this autumn on the need for ""affordability"" - and found a receptive electorate. This legislation would turn that rhetoric into action. And just as important to poor and middle-class families, it fuels our nations efforts to rebuild and onshore the energy sector that fuels economic growth.

Greater reliance on natural gas and nuclear power will deliver green and clean dividends. ARC is a win, win, win. The status quo is a lose, lose, lose.

Mine is a nonpartisan appeal for making this bill law. Legislators of America, lets meet in the middle of the aisle. Without the re-ordering of energy interests in this bill - affordability first, reliability second, and clean third - our rate cards are going to go through the roof. The economy, the hopes of the American people, and their pursuit of happiness are predicated on considerably lower rates.

The American ratepayer is the American family. And ""We the People"" - the payers - are suffering unnecessarily, and it is not by the hand of foreign actors beyond our democratic reach and control. It is being done by those who are supposed to represent us.

My fellow Americans, lend me your ears for an ADHD minute. In the recent past, we have been governed by a shackling set of priorities. Clean energy has been in the driver seat, followed by affordability, and then reliability. This ""CAR"" approach has not delivered on its promises. And it is structurally incapable of getting us over the fast-approaching AI demand hill.

The status quo CAR approach and mindset cant even service the status quo. Look no further than New Jersey, which is having a voter revolt partly because of rising electricity costs. This is not a only a blue state problem. Georgia sent an affordability message last Tuesday that should be a wake-up call for all red states, which like Texas have chased green subsidies. The rate increases are coming due for all.

If we continue to follow our current energy priorities, brown-outs, economic stagnation, and out-migration to energy-rich states will follow. ""We the People"" will all benefit from the passage of ARC Energy Security. Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters will all benefit.

What is our short-term future if we do nothing new? Take your present energy bill and multiply it by 2.3, which is the variance between American and British ratepayers in the business sector.

New Jersey, whats the mid-term future of sticking with CAR? Give your present rate card woes about a 100% increase. This is what German ratepayers are gouged for - around 40 cents per kilowatt hour - to underwrite their countrys march towards deindustrialization.

Texas and Florida - states with lower energy costs and the beneficiaries of out-migration from blue states that have gone green crazy - deduct money from your energy bill and think about what that money can do in the hands of citizens spending it in your state, and investing for retirement.

AIs appetite for reliable energy will require an energy-capacity building boom. The ARC approach will get us there; CAR will not. John Fetterman, Congressman Balderson needs a co-sponsor in the Senate. Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.

In the second Trump administration, the president has issued various executive orders, and Cabinet secretaries have put out their directives while incoming Democratic governor Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility costs. Theres a better way to govern - a better way to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.

As electricity became more available, we saw a steady rise in standard of living across America.

In summer driving to the coast in our 1955 Buick Special for a week on the beach was to me like being in heaven. Life was good and getting better.

As demand for more energy grew in the 1970s, there was much debate about filling future US energy needs. Historically, electricity generation was mostly coal, hydro and natural gas. Concern for the environment was also on the rise. As part of these concerns, nuclear power plants were being built across the country.

At this same time, Amory Lovins, an American physicist, said the world was now at an energy crossroads. Either we continue with fossil fuels and nuclear, both of which he said had “serious environmental risks” or adopt a “soft energy path” comprised mainly of wind and solar. Though unproven, he convinced many that the future was the soft energy path.

In 1976 President Jimmie Carter came out against nuclear and had solar panels installed on the Whitehouse. Later, the Obama administration defunded (undoubtedly for political reasons) construction of the Yucca Mountain used nuclear fuel storage facility. This extended the hiatus in further nuclear development and use to over fifty years.

In 1988 James Hansen, a NASA scientist, made a presentation to the U.S. Senate that implied global warming was occurring due to a slight continuing increase (about 2 ppm/yr.) in anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Data suggested that warming was now occurring at a rate of about 1 degree Celsius increase every 100 years.

John Kerry and the UN spent the next 30 years highlighting this as an immediate crisis and existential threat. Their proposed solution? Reduce CO2 by killing use of coal, oil, natural gas and replacing with wind and solar electricity.

This has been the path for 50 years, although after spending trillions of dollars, CO2 continues to rise about 2-3 ppm per year. This approach has also always ignored the elephant in the room with wind and solar: that they are intermittent, non-dispatchable and have very low-capacity factors. We also continue to spend millions of dollars pursuing hydrogen, fusion and geothermal, all of which have major technical limitations that likewise get ignored.

Natural gas and nuclear power are both proven and will reduce CO2 emissions, given nonetheless that the slow rise in CO2 above today’s 427 ppm is neither a crisis nor an emergency.

So, here we are in 2025 at another energy crossroad. Looking back on 50 years of history, it seems hard to me to not conclude that killing nuclear and pursuing the soft energy path was a mistake. With natural gas and nuclear we can for the foreseeable future produce clean, affordable, abundant, on-demand electricity critical to maintaining an acceptable standard of living in middle America.",https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/qyxjoi/picture306933066/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Energy%20Northwest%20morning%20light,N,,2025-11-09 11:21:25.939887

Liheap helps struggling households keep their heat and lights on by helping eligible families pay their utility bills.
Under normal circumstances, states would already have received Liheap funding.
However, because of the shutdown, most states are operating using limited carryover funds from last year’s budget or support from state emergency dollars.
States spend roughly 80% of Liheap funds during the winter months, when heating costs are highest.","As the stalemate over government funding and healthcare benefits continues, winter is approaching – but federal heating assistance, blocked by the shutdown, isn’t arriving in time. Millions of American families are about to face an impossible choice: heating their homes or putting food on the table. As the senator for a state known for its volatile winters and as executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, we call on states and utilities to choose a different outcome for those families and shut off the shutoffs. A nationwide freeze on utilities’ ability to disconnect customers from heat for nonpayment isn’t about politics – it’s about public safety.

The breakdown in federal budget negotiations has frozen the release of funding for many of the essential services families rely on nationwide, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap). Liheap helps struggling households keep their heat and lights on by helping eligible families pay their utility bills. With those dollars locked up in Washington gridlock, America’s seniors and working families are now at risk of losing power – just as temperatures start to plummet.

That’s why we’re calling on electric and gas utilities across the country to immediately suspend shutoffs for nonpayment until Liheap funds are released. This isn’t unprecedented: during the early months of the Covid pandemic, we called on utilities to stop shutoff for nonpayment due to the nature of the crisis, and many states and utilities did voluntarily pause disconnections to protect public health. Many states already have a regular practice of pausing disconnections during cold winter months – including Massachusetts, which is leading the way by starting the shutoff moratorium earlier to protect people hurt by the shutdown.

Under normal circumstances, states would already have received Liheap funding. However, because of the shutdown, most states are operating using limited carryover funds from last year’s budget or support from state emergency dollars. Depending on how long the government is closed, full funding may not arrive until well after most states would normally begin to help households pay heating bills.

That delay matters. States spend roughly 80% of Liheap funds during the winter months, when heating costs are highest. Without early funding, millions of low-income households could fall behind on their bills and face their power getting turned off by their utility. And for the 9% of households nationwide who rely on delivered fuels like heating oil or propane which aren’t regulated by public service commissions, a funding delay could mean no heat at all.

Families are getting squeezed on every side by the shutdown. The Trump administration has already fired most of the staff responsible for administering the program, and even recommended eliminating Liheap entirely in its budget proposal.

At the same time, energy prices are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Electricity costs are up 10% nationwide since January, and heating bills are expected to rise nearly 8% this winter. More than 210 electric and natural gas utilities have either already increased rates or proposed rate increases within the next two years. Those increased costs are hitting consumers hard: household energy debt has ballooned to $23bn, up 31% in just 18 months, and one out of every six American households is behind on energy bills. And we’re expecting to see 500,000 more households get shut off this winter compared to last year.

Energy insecurity has become one of America’s most overlooked emergencies. For low-income families, a missed payment isn’t just a financial inconvenience – it’s a crisis. When the power goes out, so do essential medical devices, space heaters, and refrigerators storing insulin and other medicines. In the richest country on earth, no family should have to face a freezing night or an avoidable emergency.

Beyond the shutdown, we need longer-term solutions, like the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, to increase funding and improve outreach for Liheap, so that no household is left behind. Until that happens, utilities have a duty to protect their customers.

This year’s begins on Monday in the Brazilian rainforest city of Belem.

But what exactly happens at these annual summits? Here’s what you need to know:

WHAT IS A COP?

The annual conference is known as a COP, which stands for Conference of the Parties that signed the 1992 U.N. climate treaty.

The treaty, called the U.N. Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), committed countries to working together to fight climate change – a problem they acknowledged all countries faced and was best tackled together.

The treaty also established the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, meaning the rich countries responsible for most of the planet-warming emissions bear a greater responsibility in solving the problem.

The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the summit agenda and works through the year to rally governments toward shared action and goals. It then hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to the issue while giving national leaders a chance to swap ideas and hold one another accountable.

Over the years, the annual summits have become a major hub of geopolitical and financial discussion – projecting the idea of a “global village” that welcomes all countries, civil society groups, businesses and financiers.

WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT COP30 THIS YEAR?

For many, this year’s 30th climate summit marks as a full-circle moment.

Brazil had hosted the Rio Earth Summit where the UNFCCC treaty was signed 33 years ago. This year, the country insisted the event would return to its roots in acknowledging the world’s most vulnerable including indigenous groups, with some joining the talks.

Brazil has asked countries to work on realizing past promises, such as a COP28 pledges to phase out fossil fuel use, rather than making new ones. COP30 is also the first to acknowledge failure in meeting the past goal of preventing warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Brazil opted to hold COP30 in the Amazon city of Belem – hoping to symbolically underline the importance of world forests that remain targets for logging and industries including mining, farming and fossil fuel extraction.

WHO ARE THE MAIN PLAYERS AT THE SUMMIT?

Most national governments send teams to the talks. Often, countries speak together in groups with similar interests.

Some of the more prominent voices include the Alliance of Small Island States facing an existential threat from rising seas, and the G77+China bloc of developing countries.

Also influential are the Africa Group and the BASIC Group consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.

The U.S., which pledged in January to quit the Paris Treaty on climate change, has stepped away from its past leadership role. China, Brazil and others have stepped in to fill the void.

TWO WEEKS SEEMS A LONG TIME – WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SUMMIT?

The sprawling COP campus is often a hive of activity, with campaigners trying to draw attention to their causes while corporations lobby policy change and seek business deals.

This year has been unique in sloughing off the usual side events and leaving financiers to meet in Sao Paulo while local leaders huddled in Rio de Janeiro. Those events, along with a meeting of world leaders in Belem, were staged before the November 10-21 COP30 in hopes of generating support and momentum for climate action for the actual talks.

During the summit’s first week, country negotiators will lay out their priorities and gauge one another’s positions. Themes should begin to emerge, while countries and companies announce action plans and pledges of financing for projects.

Negotiators are typically joined by national ministers during the second week, to haggle over final decisions including legal and technical details.

THAT SEEMS EASY, RIGHT?

COPs rarely run smoothly, with countries jockeying for deals in their national interest and drawing red lines. The talks can sometimes stall out and lead to acrimony.

Toward the end, negotiators often spend frantic all-night sessions seeking compromises. Countries then reconvene to approve decisions – by consensus, not unanimity.

The closing session, when the hammer of a gavel marks the end of the summit, is almost always delayed – sometimes by several days. Bring snacks.

Is it too late to buy the stock?
Rivian remains a high risk/high reward stock, and after the surge in price following its earnings report, I would probably pump the brakes on the stock for the moment and wait for it to cool down before adding shares here.","The share price of Rivian Automotive (RIVN +0.07%) skyrocketed after the electric vehicle (EV) maker returned to being gross-margin positive and offered upbeat commentary about the upcoming launch of its R2 SUV next year. The stock is now up nearly 50% over the past year after the surge.

Let's take a closer look at the company's results and prospects to see whether or not it's too late to buy the stock.

The R2 remains in focus

The key to Rivian becoming a profitable company that generates free cash flow largely centers around the launch of its new, lower-priced R2 next year. Its current R1 SUV can cost upward of $100,000 when fully loaded, and is thus more in the niche luxury EV SUV market. With a starting price around $45,000, the R2 will appeal to a much broader audience given its more affordable price.

That's only half the story, though. The R2 is also expected to have much better gross margins despite its lower price tag. The reason is that it will have much lower material costs than the R2, which are already contractually locked in with suppliers, and volumes are expected to be much higher, so the cost of building them will also be cheaper per vehicle, because fixed costs get absorbed across more units.

The R2 is expected to drive significant revenue growth for the company starting next year. Management aims to begin manufacturing R2 SUVs for validation by year-end, followed by building them for sale in the first half of next year, before ramping up production in the second half of 2026. In the past, the company has talked about reaching breakeven on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2027.

In the third quarter, revenue soared by 78% year over year to $1.6 billion despite fewer vehicle deliveries. The company produced 10,720 vehicles and delivered 13,201 in the quarter, compared to 13,157 vehicles produced and 10,018 delivered a year earlier.

Automobile revenue climbed by 47% year over year to $1.14 billion, while software and service revenue skyrocketed 324% from $98 million to $416 million. About half of its software and service revenue came from its joint venture with Volkswagen.

Importantly, the company was able to return to positive gross margins, posting a gross profit of $24 million. Rivian has worked hard to revamp its manufacturing and lower material costs, with its biggest breakthrough switching to a zonal architecture system that reduces the number of electrical components and wiring needed for a vehicle.

The company was able to shrink its adjusted EBITDA loss from $757 billion a year earlier to $602 million. It also reduced its free cash outflows to $421 million from $1.15 billion a year ago.

Management narrowed its delivery forecast from between 40,000 and 46,000 units to a new range of 41,500 to 43,500. It continues to expect an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $2 billion to $2.25 billion.

The company intends to finish a new factory in Georgia that will be able to make 400,000 vehicles a year. It expects it to come on line in late 2028 and be able to manufacture its planned future R3 crossover vehicle.

Is it too late to buy the stock?

Rivian has been doing a lot of good things, getting to gross margin positive and setting itself up for future success with the R2. Meanwhile, partnerships with Volkswagen and Amazon, together with a large government loan, give a long runway of cash to scale up production.

It also faces some headwinds, though, both with tariffs and the end of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. But management said the impact of tariffs is down to only a few hundred dollars per vehicle, so it is dealing with the situation well.

There was a pull-forward in demand due to the end of the EV tax credits, and it doesn't expect to benefit from the sale of regulatory tax credits next year, which are pure profit.

Review: The Rolls-Royce Spectre Is The Ultimate EV Right Now

Given the car’s $422,000 starting price, the gesture borders on comic relief. The discount feels more like a voucher toward optional extras than any real saving.

Most Rolls-Royce buyers already pour considerable sums into personalizing their cars, a habit that has long been a reliable source of profit for the BMW-owned marque.

According to Cars Direct, the incentive appeared in a recent dealer bulletin distributed by Rolls-Royce. It applies to 2025 and 2026 model-year Spectres leased through November 30.

The brand has quietly trimmed the lease offer from $7,500 to $5,000, with financing carrying an effective interest rate of about 4.6 percent APR.

Even with the credit, the U.S.-spec Spectre still costs more than it did during the now-ended $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That benefit, like the current lease credit, never extended to those who purchased the car outright.

The all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre has been part of the lineup since 2023 and now comes in two versions. The base car produces 577 hp (430 kW / 584 PS), while the Black Badge version pushes output to 650 hp (485 kW / 659 PS), making it the most powerful model from Goodwood to date. Both use a 120 kWh battery, providing up to 266 miles (428 km) of range on 23-inch wheels.

Other Discounted EVs By High-End Brands

While a $5,000 reduction on a Rolls-Royce is unlikely to sway potential buyers, other luxury automakers are showing far more enthusiasm when it comes to incentives.

Maserati, for instance, has rolled out a substantial $50,000 offer for anyone purchasing or leasing the GranTurismo and GranCabrio Folgore, along with a $25,000 discount on the Grecale Folgore SUV.

Central Health, a taxpayer-funded organization that provides health and wellnessservices for uninsured patients in Travis County, piloted the transitional dialysis program in November 2022. The goal was to provide in-center/outpatient dialysisfor Travis County residents who lacked insurance coverage.

When investigators reviewed data from November 2022 to December 2024 on the 101 patients who enrolled in the program, they observed that there was asignificant decline in the number of days patients utilized emergency dialysis in the hospital prior to finding an outpatient facility. Additionally, within 1 year of starting dialysis, most patients were able to obtain permanent dialysis access with either an arteriovenous fistula or a peritoneal dialysis catheter. Once accepted into the program, Central Health provided an insurance plan to cover outpatient dialysis and transplantation. To date, 18 patients have been listed for kidney transplantation, and 2 have received living donor transplants.

""The program has successfully facilitated dialysis access placement and transplant evaluation,"" said corresponding author Michelle Lubetzky, MD, of The University of Texas, Austin. ""Since Texas has no safety-net plan for patients who do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, the program has the potential to providea cost-effective solution and decrease in utilization of health care resources for those without medical coverage who develop kidney failure. It can be a model for other states and cities that alsolack safety net plans.""

[source: Redwood Materials]","Critical materials such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and copper are indispensable to the modern American economy. They form the backbone of technologies ranging from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers.

However, the United States currently imports almost all of these essential minerals, often sourcing them from volatile regions or geopolitical rivals. Redwood’s mission is fundamentally aimed at transforming this dependency and establishing a secure, domestic supply.

Redwood is rapidly becoming a pivotal domestic producer of critical minerals. The company is now comparable to the largest U.S. source of nickel and stands alone as the only large-scale domestic source of cobalt. Furthermore, its operations represent one of the most significant, and virtually sole new, domestic sources of lithium and copper to emerge in decades.

With approximately 90% of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America passing through its facilities, Redwood’s Nevada Campus produced over 60,000 metric tons of materials last year, establishing it as one of the nation’s most vital sources of critical minerals, whether mined or recycled. The company is now expanding its capacity with the initial startup of its South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.

The extraction of critical minerals is expensive, and the global supply chain remains fragile and dominated by China. Yet, as one of the world’s largest consumers of EVs, consumer electronics, and power tools, America already possesses a tremendous internal reserve of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese, currently locked inside everyday products.

For instance, the U.S. fleet of five million electric vehicles alone contains an estimated 2.25 million metric tons of these materials. These resources can first be unlocked through reuse in stationary storage systems and subsequently through the full recovery and refining of the underlying minerals.

Redwood’s objective is to keep these resources within the United States—recovered, refined, and redeployed for the nation’s strategic advantage. This strategy effectively converts yesterday’s imports into tomorrow’s strategic stockpile, making the U.S. more competitive, resilient, and less susceptible to foreign supply chain controls.

Access to critical minerals is not merely an economic concern; it is a vital matter of national security. The same materials powering batteries are essential for the technologies that ensure the nation’s operations and security.

Nickel and Cobalt are necessary for specialized aerospace and defense alloys.

Copper forms the foundation of industrial wiring and power transmission.

Cobalt and Copper are also critical components in the manufacturing of semiconductors and advanced electronics.

By providing domestic access to these materials, Redwood helps ensure the U.S. maintains the resources necessary for military readiness, technological leadership, and energy resilience at home.

South Carolina: The Next Hub for Recovery and Refining

The company has successfully commenced operations at its 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, with the first facility already recovering critical minerals. This initial step marks a significant beginning toward what is planned to become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses. Redwood is committed to continued growth in South Carolina over the next decade, which is projected to create more than 1,500 high-quality jobs.

South Carolina, a long-standing leader in advanced manufacturing across textiles, automotive, and aerospace, is now taking its next strategic step into critical minerals. By securing and processing these resources domestically, the state strengthens both its economy and the national interest, contributing to the rebuilding of American industry through high-value manufacturing, energy security, and local job creation.

By achieving large-scale recovery of critical minerals, Redwood is laying the foundation for American leadership in advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and the high-power technologies of the future. With recycling operations now running in South Carolina, the company is actively helping to transform the U.S. into a nation capable of securing and reusing its own essential resources.

In only two years since joining OGMP 2.0, SierraCol reached Level 5 reporting across its material assets and met all criteria for the Gold Standard – a distinction recognizing companies with the highest quality measurement-based methane data and verified mitigation performance. According to UNEP’s An Eye on Methane 2025 report, “SierraCol and Kiwetinohk reported assets at Level 5 in their second year of membership”, achieving the Gold Standard within two years of joining the initiative.

SierraCol’s achievement represents not just an environmental milestone but also a demonstration of leadership in operational excellence and responsible growth. The company’s discipline in setting NPV-positive decarbonization initiatives – each with a payback in the short term – reinforces that emissions reduction can create measurable economic value and align with business performance.

“Reliable methane measurements drive high-impact decarbonization – guiding investment toward projects that deliver quick, measurable, and lasting value” said Juan Carlos Lopez Ballen, Head of Decarbonization and water footprint, at SierraCol Energy.

SierraCol’s rapid progress builds on its early recognition in the An Eye on Methane 2024 report, where UNEP highlighted its “best-in-class implementation plan” among first-year participants – including robust reduction targets, comprehensive mitigation plans, and a clear roadmap for Level 4 and Level 5 reporting across material assets.

To achieve this year’s milestone, SierraCol partnered with Insight M as its technical solutions provider for Level 5 measurement campaigns. Insight M employed integrated, measurement-based methodologies – combining site-level screening and source-level quantification – to reconcile methane emissions across diverse field conditions. This approach enhanced the accuracy and reliability of SierraCol’s OGMP 2.0 data and provided the measurement integrity necessary for UNEP’s Gold Standard verification.

“SierraCol’s success demonstrates how rigorous measurement and innovative technical design can transform methane management from a compliance task into a leadership advantage,” said David Bercovich, Chief Executive Officer at Insight M. “Our collaboration shows that strong data and practical implementation can deliver both climate impact and economic performance.”

SierraCol’s advancement exemplifies how credible data, reliable measurement, and strong governance can accelerate progress toward measurable methane reduction. Together, SierraCol, Insight M, and OGMP 2.0 are helping define what meaningful, verifiable methane leadership looks like across the energy sector in Latin America.

Buncombe County served 1,529 households through the program last year, 221 of those were elderly or disabled according to Kimberly Fullerton, program administrator for the county’s health and human services department.

The program provides a one-time payment to utility companies such as Duke Energy or French Broad Electric to help eligible households pay their heating bills.

Summer Tonizzo, senior media relations manager for the NC Department of Health and Human Services, told BPR in an email that households who are part of the elderly or disabled group may automatically be approved again this year.

“If the government shutdown continues, no additional funding will be available, and new applications will not be accepted,” Tonizzo said. “Only those who are pre-approved will receive assistance.

County officials add that unless there's a budget passed at the federal level, there is no more funding.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1233658/2147483647/strip/true/crop/837x439+0+75/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F13%2F57c84c4b4f1f9085baf7b096049e%2Fscreenshot-2023-08-02-144443.png,N,,2025-11-09 07:00:15.954249

COPENHAGEN, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, November 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Norrsent, a global leader in enterprise risk and compliance technology, today announced two milestone initiatives that redefine how organizations manage risk in an age of transformation: the launch of its AI-native Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) platform and the debut of its Climate Partner Program, a global effort to support organizations pursuing decarbonization and sustainability goals.

“Risk management has long been about hindsight. We’re making it about foresight. Our new ERM platform uses AI to learn from your data, predict emerging risks, and guide leaders toward smarter, faster decisions—while the Climate Partner Program ensures that climate innovators can access the same tools without financial barriers.”

AI Meets ISO 31000:

Built on the ISO 31000 framework and deployed on secure AWS multi-AZ cloud infrastructure, Norrsent’s new platform transforms risk management from a compliance exercise into an intelligent, adaptive system.

Organizations can model risks across subsidiaries, assets, and projects with role-based access, customizable risk matrices, and immutable audit trails.

Key capabilities include:

- AI-assisted risk identification and mitigation workflows

- Dynamic dashboards with contextual AI Copilot insights

- KRI tracking, control management, and incident reporting

- One-click reporting to Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and PDF

- Enterprise-grade RBAC and SSO integration for full governance

- Every customer environment runs in an isolated schema, ensuring complete data segregation and compliance across jurisdictions.

Introducing the Norrsent Climate Partner Program:

In parallel with the platform launch, Norrsent announced its Climate Partner Program—an initiative to empower decarbonization leaders with free access to Norrsent ERM for their first year.

Through the program, qualifying organizations in sectors such as renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS), green hydrogen, and sustainable manufacturing will receive:

- Full platform access for 12 months, with no user or feature limitations

- Dedicated climate risk support and decarbonization-specific templates

- Membership in a global community of climate leaders

- Expert guidance on multi-project and multi-subsidiary risk frameworks

“Decarbonization projects face a perfect storm of policy uncertainty, technology risk, and financial complexity. Our Climate Partner Program gives pioneers the visibility and control they need to move fast without compromising governance.”

Built for Climate Complexity and Scale:

Decarbonization projects introduce layers of risk—from evolving regulations to supply-chain dependencies. Norrsent ERM enables organizations to consolidate all climate-related risks within one adaptive framework, linking operational metrics to strategic outcomes.

Whether managing a single pilot or an international portfolio, the system scales seamlessly with each organization’s ambition.

Qualified participants can continue under standard enterprise pricing after the first year, ensuring continuity as projects expand.

That means Prospect Park cut its annual carbon emissions by about 1,620 metric tons, roughly the output of 378 gasoline cars in a year.
Wedged between the University of Minnesota's St. Paul and Minneapolis campuses, Prospect Park is perhaps best known for its Witch's Hat tower.
John Wike, another Prospect Park resident, said he came across Britton's campaign in the neighborhood email.
""We feel Prospect Park is the leading example,"" Gosiewski said.","MINNEAPOLIS -- Mary Britton remembers the distress she felt in the summer of 2019, when images of huge wildfires in Spain and Australia flared up on the internet.

The fires were made worse by climate change, studies showed. Britton, a financial analyst living in Minneapolis, responded by reducing her own carbon footprint.

She insulated her attic, replaced her gas water heater with an electric one and made other energy efficiency upgrades to slash the amount of natural gas she burned to heat her home. She also began sharing information about the upgrades with fellow Prospect Park neighborhood residents and pointed them to the local and federal rebates available to save money on the work.

The effort paid off. Residents of Prospect Park used 29 percent less natural gas between 2019 and the end of 2024, according to CenterPoint Energy, while citywide gas use fell by 20 percent during that period. That means Prospect Park cut its annual carbon emissions by about 1,620 metric tons, roughly the output of 378 gasoline cars in a year.

The Trump administration has turned away from the collective fight to slow global warming, shunning efforts by the United Nations and reversing federal policies that encouraged clean energy. In response, some Minnesotans who care about climate action are turning their attention to changes they can make locally.

Britton said she's already in talks with other neighborhood associations and nonprofits to do similar work in their communities.

""That's the exciting thing -- these people feel part of something bigger,"" she said. ""Everybody waiting for somebody else to do something ... that's not going to work.""

In July, Congress rescinded hundreds of billions of dollars in federal tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the affected credits are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. Claiming those incentives can save homeowners up to 30 percent off the total cost for various home improvements, including replacing windows, putting in new insulation and installing heat pumps or solar panels. Those credits, which were previously available until 2032, now expire at the end of the year.

Wedged between the University of Minnesota's St. Paul and Minneapolis campuses, Prospect Park is perhaps best known for its Witch's Hat tower. The hilly neighborhood of 875 residential properties spans roughly a square mile.

For Britton, focusing on the changes she can make at the local level, even just in her neighborhood, has helped her cope with the Trump administration's cuts to federal climate and clean energy programs this year, she said. Some of her neighbors expressed similar sentiments.

Nan Kari, who lives down the street from Britton, said the work she's done to reduce the carbon emissions of her home have been cathartic for her. After coming across Britton's campaign, she said, she replaced 11 windows and a door. She also replaced her old HVAC system with a heat pump and a backup furnace.

""That's what it takes, citizen action ... for a larger public good,"" Kari said, adding that she believes local action is especially important ""in the absence of federal leadership -- or corporate leadership, for that matter.""

John Wike, another Prospect Park resident, said he came across Britton's campaign in the neighborhood email. It persuaded him to install insulation in his walls and attic last year. He also insulated part of his roof this month, he said, and will soon install an electric water heater.

Helping the environment was his primary motivation, but the home improvements have also made his century-old house more comfortable, Wike said. ""Especially with insulation in an older house in Minnesota, it's made a huge difference with cold drafts in the winter and heat in the summer,"" he said.

""One of our dogs has passed away recently, but we're getting another dog. And it's like, you don't want to have dogs in the house, where it's 90 degrees in the kitchen,"" Wike said.

The improvements weren't cheap. Both Kari and Wike each spent tens of thousands of dollars for the work, even with the local and federal rebates. But the incentives were a big help, they said, saving them each about $11,000 total. Wike said he expects the federal credits alone to save him $2,400.

CenterPoint Energy said in a statement that Prospect Park is one of the neighborhoods where the company is seeing increased participation in its rebate programs. The utility also noted that 2019 was a below average year for temperatures, while 2024 was an above average year, which influenced the amount of gas used by homeowners.

Still, Prospect Park residents like Kari and Wike view the outcome as a testament to Britton's hard work, which involved regular email blasts through the neighborhood association and visits to local events and church services.

Britton said one thing that she believes helped her campaign was that she never told people what to do -- she only provided them with information and resources.

""People want to do the right thing, but they don't want to be lectured,"" Britton said. ""I never told people to turn down their thermostat.""

Minneapolis residents in other parts of the city are taking note of Britton's campaign as well.

""We've been copying Mary's approach from Prospect Park to engage neighbors in my own Corcoran neighborhood,"" said Sean Gosiewski, executive director of Resilient Cities and Communities, an environmental advocacy group. At least 10 residents in his neighborhood have installed heat pumps this year, thanks to the outreach, he said.

They learned the principles of environmental justice, then returned to their divisions as in-house experts.
Dr. Marva King was a contracting officer for the Department of the Navy when she read an environmental policy book and first learned about, and became interested in, environmental justice.
The archive now preserves not just the story of one woman’s career but a record of how environmental justice became a federal commitment.","Dr. Clarice Gaylord was surprised when she received a call from President Barack Obama’s office in 2008. He was attempting to coax her out of retirement to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. “What part of ‘retirement’ don’t you understand?” she recalled asking his team, with a laugh. “I’ve done my work.”

Her refusal was based on one thing: She was ready to rest. By then, Gaylord had spent decades shaping federal environmental policy. Her story is one of bureaucratic persistence and the ability to turn exclusion into strategy, and strategy into national policy.

When Gaylord began her federal career in the 1960s, she was a research scientist studying the causes of breast cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Her work was meticulous and well-regarded, but her upward mobility stopped at the laboratory door.

“One problem I had at the cancer institute was dealing with the superficial prejudice against hiring women and minorities,” she recalled. “They’d hire you for a position, but not a major one.” Determined not to be sidelined, Gaylord applied for a job in personnel. If the system wouldn’t move her, she would move the system.

In 1980, a high school friend had been offered a leadership role at the Environmental Protection Agency but was finishing her PhD and couldn’t accept. She passed Gaylord’s name along to the hiring official, and soon, Gaylord found herself in an interview with Charles Grizzle, the agency’s assistant administrator.

After scanning her resume, Grizzle asked, “Why would a PhD scientist be interested in a job in personnel?” Gaylord recalled telling him that she really wasn’t but wanted to ensure that no other woman or minority was held back from ascending the federal career ladder. Grizzle, stunned but delighted, replied, “This is wonderful. You have a job.”

At the EPA, one of her first acts as personnel director was to analyze where people were, and weren’t, advancing within the agency. The data told a story she already knew: The lowest ranks were filled with women, most of them secretaries, who rarely had the credentials to move into higher-paying technical or administrative positions.

Rather than accept that as immutable, Gaylord established a training partnership between the EPA and a nearby community college, offering courses that would qualify secretaries for higher-grade positions, paid for by the agency. Some managers threatened to fire secretaries who applied. Gaylord, unfazed, marched into their offices to remind them that supporting their staff’s professional growth wasn’t optional.

The program worked. Secretaries became administrators. Some became managers. Gaylord’s own assistant enrolled in the program and later moved up the ranks. Across the agency, women started envisioning careers that stretched decades ahead. And that was just the beginning for Gaylord.

In the early 1990s, EPA administrator William Reilly called Gaylord into his office with an unexpected proposal. He wanted her to create something that didn’t yet exist: A federal program focused on environmental equity and justice.

At the time, from protests in Warren County, North Carolina, to marches in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, the battle for environmental justice had started to intensify in the streets and in the courthouse. Within the EPA, though, efforts to address environmental injustice were viewed as an intrusion, something that would complicate the current long-standing programs. But Gaylord knew there was a bigger picture.

With a skeleton staff and almost no budget (she was given just $400,000 to cover a national initiative), she set about defining what environmental justice would mean inside the federal government. Her first move was structural. She created the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), modeled on the scientific advisory boards she’d worked with at the cancer institute. The council would bring together experts, community leaders, and academics to ensure that research and funding reached the communities most affected by pollution.

She also established a program linking historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) with major research institutions like Harvard and Yale. The idea was simple but revolutionary: Pair universities that had access to federal grants with those that had access to communities. “White researchers told me, ‘They don’t want to talk to us,’” Gaylord recalled. “I told them, ‘That’s why you’ll work with Black colleges.’”

Through her efforts, HBCUs gained new visibility and funding in environmental research. She also launched a paid internship program for Black college students, ensuring that environmental policy would no longer be shaped without them in the room.

Resistance came swiftly. When President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 in 1994, directing all federal agencies to develop strategies for environmental justice, many at the EPA dismissed it as an “unfunded mandate.” Offices responsible for clean air, clean water, and toxic waste argued that they already had laws to follow. Gaylord’s initiatives, they said, were redundant.

To build consensus around the initiative, she invited staffers to spend six months embedded in her department. They learned the principles of environmental justice, then returned to their divisions as in-house experts. “They didn’t want to do it at first, and they asked, ‘Who’s going to pay for this?’” she recalled. But soon, they saw the advantage.

Dr. Marva King was a contracting officer for the Department of the Navy when she read an environmental policy book and first learned about, and became interested in, environmental justice. “There was a program for women that wanted to break the ceiling, and I thought this could help me,” King said. “Then, I found out that they had just started a program at the Environmental Protection Agency called the Office of Environmental Justice and had hired Clarice Gaylord to be the director.” Soon enough, Gaylord had hired King.

Gaylord and King made the perfect pair, ensuring that communities had a seat at the table and that their voices were heard in the conversation on environmental justice. But navigating the politics of a federal agency as a Black woman wasn’t easy. “People are always doubting what you’re doing or not doing and also not respecting and appreciating you, and the way you are as a person,” King said. “Black women, especially those of us who manage others, get this a lot.”

The work came with an additional emotional toll as well. King said, “I’ve been to communities where I saw men come home and take their work clothes off on the porch and leave them. . . . They were trying to do what they could, but it made no difference because that pollution was still coming over from across the road, into their homes, their backyards, the schools, the churchyards. They were eating food from the contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water.”

By the time Gaylord retired in 1999, environmental justice was written into the EPA’s mission. The office she’d started in a basement, without even a phone line, had become one of the agency’s most influential programs. Under her direction, law schools received funding to train students in civil rights–based environmental law, and community programs documented exposure in low-income neighborhoods. Her commitment inspired a generation of environmental leaders who built on Gaylord’s foundation by tackling air pollution at the community level. Many of the EPA’s current environmental-justice programs still trace their frameworks directly to Gaylord’s initiatives.

Gaylord has received more than 30 awards, including from the State of Connecticut and Howard University’s Distinguished Alumni award. Yet she kept most of them tucked under her bed. “They were heavy,” she joked, “and I was done carrying things.”

When the Library of Congress called in 2024 to acquire her papers, she and her daughter, Altoria Gaylord, packed boxes of photographs, memos, speeches, and correspondence from her decades of public service. “We signed the paperwork donating mom’s work for the betterment of the American people,” Altoria said. The archive now preserves not just the story of one woman’s career but a record of how environmental justice became a federal commitment.

Gaylord’s advice for the next generation of environmental-justice workers? “It’s one thing to identify a problem,” she said. “But you have to be strategic and take action to see progress. It’s important to keep people informed on how to do the work, both now and in the future.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-09 07:19:18.860004

Here's why.,"undefined, thenevadaindependent.com, eric-neugeboren, tabitha-mueller",,,,,https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/almost-all-nevada-film-tax-credits-arent-used-by-film-companies-heres-why/,"But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.
Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program.
In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees.
Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits.
Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.","For years, those looking to expand Nevada’s film tax credit program have touted their potential to bring jobs, diversify the state’s economy and even provide funding for pre-K programs.

But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.

In the more than 10-year history of Nevada’s film tax credit program, more than 98 percent of the credits have been transferred from movie studios to other companies. In total, the state has issued more than $35 million in tax credits, but only about $600,000 have not been transferred.

In Nevada, film tax credits offered by the state are transferrable by law, meaning that studios qualifying for the credits are allowed to sell the credits to other businesses for cash (usually for less than the value of the credits), which can then use them to offset their own tax liability. The three tax types that the credits can be used for are not significant burdens on film companies, which is why they rarely use it themselves.

That structure is not novel — federally, these kinds of credits have been created for projects ranging from clean energy to low-income housing, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, Nevada lawmakers could massively expand the film tax credit program by twelve-fold in the upcoming fall special session, prompting concerns from progressive groups and economists opposed to film tax credits that it could functionally serve as a handout to already wealthy corporations and prevent the state from using its dollars on other programs.

“The only purpose to make these tax credits transferable is to launder subsidy payments through other businesses’ tax returns,” said James Hohman, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based nonprofit that advocates for limited government. “The derogatory term ‘launder’ may seem extreme. That's exactly what is going on in the situation.”

UNR Economics Professor Elliott Parker disagreed with Hohman’s characterization, saying it’s a frequently used tool for economic development, and referred to the transferable structure as more of a “sleight of hand” budgeting maneuver.

“We’re making it look like we're giving them a break on the taxes that they pay,” Parker explained. “But in fact, what we're doing is we're allowing them to make money by selling it to other firms that would have been paying those taxes.”

But he said the proposal to set aside $120 million in tax credits each year for the next 15 years would undoubtedly have an effect on the state’s budget and ability to collect taxes and that’s something lawmakers need to consider.

Proponents of film tax credits have said transferable credits are preferred by governments as a means to attract and sustain economic activity because they do not require a direct cash appropriation to a company, which is prohibited under state law.

David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes — the developer behind the proposed studio project — said the legislation is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” that requires $1.8 billion in investments from companies before they receive the credits, and the whole idea is for the state to meet economic goals and create jobs it wouldn’t get without the tax credits.

“The proposed legislation doesn’t hand out cash — it rewards private investment and local hiring,” O’Reilly said. “These are precisely the kinds of smart, performance-based incentives that will help future-proof Nevada’s economy and keep our most talented residents working here at home.”

How the transferring works

As is the case with Nevada’s existing film tax credit program, the proposal likely to be discussed during the upcoming special session could be used to offset payments related to the state’s insurance premium tax, gaming license fees or modified business tax (which is assessed on payroll).

However, film studios are only subject to the payroll tax, meaning that the credits would likely be sold for cash to gaming or insurance companies to offset their own tax burden.

Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program. That means it could take considerable time for the tax credit to be redeemed in full, according to the film office. The credits must be redeemed within four years of being granted.

It is also standard practice for film production companies to use outside groups to facilitate payroll for their employees, meaning those third parties would be subject to the tax rather than the film production company.

In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees. Credits used for the modified business tax are a distant third.

Notably, the state considers the individual details of these transfers to be confidential, leaving the public in the dark about which companies are buying the tax credits and how much in cash the film studios are receiving in return. Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits. The companies that purchase credits at a discount, however, receive the full face value of the credits off their tax bills — so they effectively get a tax break.

Hohman, who opposed a similar proposal in Michigan, added that the confidentiality of these transactions “is a travesty.”

“People should know who's collecting their taxpayer money,” he said.

What the proposal says

Under the proposal likely to come up in this special session — sponsored by Assms. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) — the state starting in 2028 would set aside $120 million in annual transferable tax credits for the industry for the next 15 years, an exponential increase from the existing $10 million annual limit.

Of this pot of money, $95 million would be set aside annually for productions at a yet-to-be-built studio in Las Vegas’ Summerlin community, while the remaining $25 million would be available for productions elsewhere in the state. There’s likely more opportunity for developers to use the tax credits themselves on that larger-scale project.

The base amount of credits that a film production company could receive is 30 percent of all qualified expenses, which can cover anything from set construction to facility leasing. However, that number could be lowered if the company does not hire enough Nevada workers or does not provide sufficient training or work opportunities to underrepresented groups.

An amended version of the bill also put forward new spending requirements for production companies, including investments of $900 million in construction by the end of 2029 and $1.8 billion in capital investment by the end of 2038. If they fail to meet these milestones, the amendment could require a lien be placed against the remaining undeveloped land in an amount equal to the shortfall. Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.

The credits would expire six years after they are issued, an increase from the four-year limit that is in place with the existing program.

Because of this leeway in using the credits, opponents say it could be a pain point for the state budgeting process. If production companies chose to redeem tens of millions of dollars worth of credits in the same year, that would mean less revenue coming into the state, potentially imperiling other initiatives that require state dollars.

It further called for 80 percent of climate finance to be directed toward locally led adaptation efforts.","COP30 Leaders’ Summit concluded with the adoption of the ‘Call of Bel&eacute;m for the Climate’, a declaration urging accelerated global efforts to confront the worsening climate crisis. Meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém—33 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement—heads of state reaffirmed their commitment to multilateral climate action, solidarity, and sustainability.

The declaration underscored that “climate change is no longer a threat of the future—it is a tragedy of the present.” Leaders highlighted the urgent need to address intensifying floods, droughts, and wildfires that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. The Call of Bel&eacute;m emphasized bridging the “ambition, implementation, and means-of-implementation gaps” that continue to hinder progress toward the 1.5°C target.

The declaration outlined several key priorities, including tripling adaptation finance by 2030 and fully operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund. It also emphasized implementing the Baku–Belém Roadmap, which aims to mobilize $1.3trn annually by 2035 for developing countries. Leaders stressed the need to strengthen climate governance, reform global financial systems, and expand fair, grant-based climate finance.

Furthermore, the declaration called for advancing the transition away from fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while integrating technology transfer, digital innovation, and inclusive development into all aspects of climate action.

Nepal highlighted its rapid transition toward electric mobility and clean energy, and its strong policy frameworks through NDC 3.0 and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP)

‘Climate crisis is our daily reality’

Representing Nepal at the summit, government officials reaffirmed the country’s leadership in nature conservation and sustainable development despite its negligible carbon footprint.

“Nearly 46 percent of Nepal’s land remains under forest cover, protected in partnership with local communities and Indigenous Peoples,” Nepal’s statement read. “Home to Mount Everest and the Himalayas, our country sustains vital ecosystems that provide clean air and fresh water to billions downstream,” said Rajendra Prasad Mishra, Secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment.

Nepal highlighted its rapid transition toward electric mobility and clean energy, and its strong policy frameworks through NDC 3.0 and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Earlier this year, the country hosted the Sagarmatha Sambaad, a global dialogue that reinforced collective commitment to multilateralism and keeping global warming below 1.5°C.

However, the statement warned that for mountain nations like Nepal, “the climate crisis is not a future threat but a daily reality.” Over 300 lives were lost this year alone to floods, landslides, droughts, glacial lake outbursts, and forest fires intensified by extreme temperatures.

Nepal called on COP30 to deliver concrete outcomes, including the realization of the Baku–Belém Roadmap for mobilizing $1.3trn in climate finance, tripling adaptation finance, and fully operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund with simplified and direct access for vulnerable countries. “We no longer have the luxury of delay,” Nepal’s statement concluded. “Let us act now—together—to safeguard our people, their livelihoods, and our planet.”

Youths call for climate justice and inclusion

Youths have called for urgent and equitable climate action through a pre-COP30 discussion with government representatives including Madan Prasad Pariyar, Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development. The dialogue “From the Himalayas to the Amazon: Understanding Climate Negotiations and Nepal’s Engagement” highlighted youth priorities and Nepal’s climate agenda, connecting voices from the Himalayas to the Amazon. For young people in Nepal, a country contributing less than 0.1 percent of global emissions yet among the most climate-vulnerable, the climate crisis is not a future concern but a lived reality. Melting glaciers, erratic rainfall, and worsening floods and droughts have already threatened livelihoods, ecosystems, and our collective future.

In Nepal, youth are already leading the way, organizing climate campaigns, promoting clean energy, and advancing resilience in communities. Yet, their inclusion in decision-making remains limited. Genuine youth participation must be institutionalized, not symbolic, so that young people are recognized as partners in shaping climate policy and solutions, they say.

The event, organized by Clean Energy Nepal, Nepalese Youth for Climate Action (NYCA), and in collaboration with other youth networks, aimed to strengthen youth understanding of international climate processes and align youth advocacy with Nepal’s national climate priorities. “This initiative gave us the platform to translate our concerns into concrete policy recommendations. Nepalese youth are not only demanding change, we are helping shape it,” said Aakriti Dotel, Network Coordinator of NYCA.

The declaration underscored that “climate change is no longer a threat of the future—it is a tragedy of the present”

During the meeting, youth representatives presented a joint statement outlining collective priorities for Nepal’s engagement at COP30. In their official submission to the Ministry, they urged the government to keep 1.5°C alive by upholding science-based ambition, emphasizing that every fraction of a degree matters for mountains and communities.

They called for climate justice, prioritizing fairness for the Global South and ensuring that vulnerable nations receive support rather than debt. The statement highlighted the need for grant-based finance, technology transfer, and capacity building to enhance adaptation and resilience, alongside the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund for recovery from unavoidable climate impacts. It further called for 80 percent of climate finance to be directed toward locally led adaptation efforts.

The youths also emphasized the importance of advancing the Dushanbe Glacier Declaration 2025, integrating the mountain agenda into global policy, and institutionalizing the participation of youth, women, and Indigenous Peoples in all climate processes. Additional priorities included promoting clean energy and a just transition through renewable energy and green jobs, recognizing the linkages between climate change, health, and sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), and upholding accountability and human rights in line with the ICJ ruling obligating all nations to align their actions with the 1.5°C target.

Minister Pariyar welcomed the youth recommendations, assuring that their perspectives would be integrated into Nepal’s COP30 position. “Youth voices are vital in shaping effective climate strategies. The government will continue to create platforms for young people to contribute meaningfully to climate action,” he said.",https://annapurnaexpress.prixacdn.net/media/albums/COP30_Nepal_aQSUEXX7Ma.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:58:32.813196

This as the average global renewable power capacity growth falls short of the required trajectory to achieve the tripling target by 2030.

For the tripling of renewable power capacity to reach 11.2 terawatts (TW) in 2030, an average of 1122 gigawatts (GW) per annum is required between 2025 and 2030. Whereas in 2024, 581.9 GW of new renewable power capacity was added, representing a 15.1 percent annual growth rate, this represented an increase of just 0.7 percentage points compared to the 14.4 percent growth reported in 2023.

If the growth rate seen in 2024 continued for the remaining years of the decade, only 10.3 TW of renewable power capacity would be installed by 2030, falling 0.9 TW (7.7 percent) short of the target, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has revealed.

In October, IRENA published a report in which it assessed the progress of the COP28 historic UAE Consensus. The COP28, 2023 consensus, in which 133 countries pledged to triple global installed renewable power capacity by 2030 compared to 2022 levels, has a critical milestone for keeping the 1.5°C goal within reach.

Since capacity additions in both 2023 and 2024 fell short of the required 16.1 percent growth rate, renewable capacity must now expand even faster (16.6 percent annually) in the remaining six years of the decade to deliver 6.7 TW of installed renewable power capacity.

Whereas only nine countries, all in the European Union, had targets covering power, heat and fuels, just a few countries, such as Montenegro, Ukraine, and Slovenia, announced or updated renewable heat targets. Elsewhere, some, like Japan, the Philippines and Poland, revised their biofuel mandates in 2024.

“An assessment of national energy plans and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) shows that NDCs collectively target 5.8 TW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, 22 percent less than the national energy plans and policies of 7.4 TW target. This misalignment between domestic policy and NDC targets can signal a mismatch between domestic priorities and commitments to the international community,” the IRENA report discloses.

An analysis of the NDC targets for Least Developed Countries’ (LCDs) shows that of the 60 GW of additional capacity targets by 2030, 38 GW (or 60 percent) are conditional on receiving international financial assistance.

Elsewhere, 65 percent of targeted capacity from small island developing states (SIDS) were also conditional (2.8 GW), with 56 percent as well conditional in sub-Saharan Africa (34 GW).

However, an estimated $71b out of $116b (or 61 percent) of the investment is required from international sources as concessional finance to meet the required investment for capacity additions.

The report also detailed how national plans and targets for renewable power generation capacity have increased by just 2.0 percent following the adoption of the tripling of renewable power goal at the COP28 held in the UAE in 2023.

A quantification of the renewable power targets in NDCs submitted as of 1 October 2025 revealed that existing targets aim to collectively increase total renewable energy capacity to approximately 5.8 TW by 2030, from 4.4 TW today. Little wonder, Mr Francesco La Camera, director-general, IRENA, says energy efficiency improvements have been negligible.

The equitable deployment and distribution of this renewable power will depend, La Camera added, on the international community’s ability to unlock additional financing for renewables, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies.

Last week, IRENA launched the second Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA) Investment Forum in Freetown, Sierra Leone, aiming to scale up investments and advance the energy transition and green industrialisation across APRA countries.

The two-day event built on the success of last year’s inaugural forum in Nairobi, Kenya, which mobilised a project pipeline valued at $2.7b and around 1 GW of potential renewable power generation capacity. The forum aimed to bridge the gap between Africa’s renewable potential and the pace of its deployment by mobilising investment and facilitating matchmaking between project promoters, developers, and potential investors.

Every year, countries that have joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meet to measure progress and negotiate multilateral responses to climate change.

Today, there are 198 Parties to the Convention. The UNFCCC is a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992 shortly after the first assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system.”

Since entering into force in 1994, the UNFCCC has provided the basis for international climate negotiations, including landmark agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015). COPs have created global milestones for the climate movement.

In 2024, 581.9 GW of new renewable power capacity was added, representing a 15.1 percent annual growth rate, an increase of 0.7 percentage points. The capacity growth still falls short of the trajectory required to achieve the tripling target by 2030.

“Interconnection wait times have spiked in some markets where grid planning has not taken into account the tripling goal. Grid constraints have also become more impactful, with technical curtailment growing,” the report says.

In least developed countries (LDCs), energy access deficits tend to remain high, financing costs are exorbitant, and debt-to-GDP ratios are among the highest in the world. Annual average investments in renewable power capacity between 2025 and 2030 must increase by 2.3 times to around $1.44 trillion per year compared to $0.6 trillion in 2024.

Total global investment in renewable power generation capacity reached $624b in 2024. However, this growth rate is well below the 28 percent growth observed in 2023. While the technological maturity of renewables and supportive policies have positioned the industry at the heart of climate and energy strategies, there is still a substantial investment and financing gap in the volumes needed for the tripling goal globally.

According to Dr Kandeh Yumkella, Energy Sector Lead, chairman of the Presidential Initiative on Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Food Security (PI-CREF), substantial investment is essential for the energy transition ambitions of African nations to be realised.

Africa, which is home to 17 percent of the global population, has received less than 2.0 percent of worldwide investments in renewable energy in the last decade. Changing this will require reformed and enhanced public finance at all levels, Dr Kandeh told delegates at the 2025 APRA Investment Forum.

Africa requires an average annual investment of $70b in renewable energy, yet investments in 2023 reached only $15b, a record high, but still just 2.3 percent of global investment in the sector. Through the Nairobi Declaration, African countries aim to install 300 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 to meet the increasing demand and drive Africa's transition to a low-carbon future.

On the sidelines of the conference, Dr Fadhel Kaboub, associate professor of Economics, Denison University, said only deliberate structural transformation, partnerships and collaboration among African countries will help them to achieve their targets.

“We must start thinking about joint industrial policies, which require strategic planning, long-term cooperation with partners that have the technology, and a win-win scenario for the African continent, for the APRA countries, and for the partner countries from the industrialised world,” Dr Kaboub said.

“The structural transformation requires policies that simultaneously address the root causes of external debt, but all of these are climate adaptation policies. Investing in renewable energy sovereignty, and in real green industrialisation that gets us out of the bottom of the hierarchy as exporters of raw materials, is the real deal,” he added.

In October, IRENA launched the second Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA) Investment Forum in Freetown, Sierra Leone, seeking to scale up investments to advance the energy transition and green industrialisation across APRA countries.

African countries are gearing up for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, not just with a climate agenda but a new and broader model of continental cooperation aimed at tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling the energy efficiency by 2030.

Last week, African leaders, including policymakers, senior government leaders, central bank officials, economists and development partners, met for the G20 conference in Dakar, Senegal, to discuss how the continent can consolidate and protect its gains.

Currently, Africa has only 70 GW of installed renewable power capacity, representing 1.6 percent of the global total. However, to meet growing electricity demand, IRENA says electricity generation will need to increase by 36 percent by 2030, and to triple by 2050, compared to 2023 levels.

Under the 1.5°C Scenario, the unlocking of sustainable renewable energy resources to meet the 2030 target would require a quadrupling of capacity to around 300 GW by 2030, in line with the 2023 Nairobi Declaration, it states.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s external debt stock reached $863b in 2023, equivalent to 169 percent of total exports, with average bond yields at 9.8 percent. Debt-service costs now consume 16 percent of export revenues, a massive drain on future development.

Addressing illicit financial flows (IFFs), which cost the continent an estimated $88b annually, and establishing regional financing mechanisms such as the African Monetary Fund and the African Stability Mechanism, are crucial to restoring fiscal stability.

Last week, Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk based on operational and valuation milestones over 10 years. Rivian said the plan will retain its founder and keep him focused on growth and profitability as the automaker, known for its R1S SUVs and R1T pickups, prepares to launch its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 will compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover. Rivian's board also doubled Scaringe's base salary to $2 million, saying the changes were made with input from an independent compensation consultant and designed to better align pay with shareholder returns. Separately, Scaringe was granted 1 million common units in Mind Robotics, a newly formed Rivian spinoff with external funding developing industrial AI technology.

That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.
“The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles — they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.” That’s where advanced recycling comes in.
The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.
“Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment.","Welcome to the economic future of the United States: Big Tech, Big Data — and Big … Recycling?

That’s the conclusion of a new analysis from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which says that if America dominates the coming advanced recycling industry the same way it has dominated technology, the results could be billions in economic activity and tens of thousands of jobs.

The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg. What’s needed is a new mindset. “Recycling is really manufacturing.”

Instead of looking at used plastics as a problem to be solved, he says, they should be seen as a resource to be monetized. That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.

“Mechanical recycling is tried and true,” Eisenberg said, but it can’t handle many of the most common forms of plastic. “The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles — they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.”

That’s where advanced recycling comes in. Unlike mechanical recycling, advanced recycling turns plastics into a gas or liquid raw material — “reducing them back to molecules,” Eisenberg says — which can then be turned into “brand-new plastics for use in virtually any product or packaging type, including food- and pharmaceutical-grade plastics.”

Similar to the way the mining industry supplies raw materials that are turned into consumer products, recycling plastic into its raw form can supply industries with raw materials while removing massive amounts of plastic from the waste stream.

The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.

A 2021 Government Accountability Office report touted the technology. “Chemical recycling can produce raw materials of virgin quality, thereby decreasing demand for fossil fuels and other natural resources,” the report states. “Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment. Chemical recycling creates a market for plastic waste and a new way to reuse some plastics.”

The ACC analysis suggests that widespread use of advanced recycling would create 173,200 jobs with a total annual payroll of $12.8 billion. It could also add $48.7 billion in total economic output — the combined value of goods and services produced directly and indirectly as a result.

“Essentially the same economic contributions annually of the milk industry in the United States,” Eisenberg said.

The challenge is no longer technology, but regulation, Eisenberg says. Calling the current political landscape a “plethora of regulatory barriers,” he urged state and federal governments to consider the advanced recycling of plastics as manufacturing instead of waste incineration. Any plastic produced through this process would be subject to recycling regulations.

“We think that would really help unlock some of the private investment that has been waiting to go,” he said.

The ACC is calling for a consistent national framework with clear standards, funding, incentives, infrastructure build-up and public education. Eisenberg said those standards would help with the recycling process and recycled materials, along with waste reduction.

The plastics industry still faces plenty of skepticism from environmental groups and lawmakers. Organizations such as Greenpeace USA have claimed very little plastic is being recycled, and the World Wildlife Fund has called for a ban on single-use plastic cups and cutlery by the end of the year. More than 500 U.S. communities have banned single-use plastic bags, and a dozen states have done likewise.

According to Environmental Protection Agency data, 32% of disposable items are recycled annually. Raising that rate to the EPA’s goal of 50% by 2030 will require major changes in how plastics are processed.

Critics are stuck in the past, Eisenberg says, adding that the plastics industry has changed. Plastic products are now designed with “end of life” in mind from the outset of production. It’s an approach that, with the aid of new technology, can promote recycling and stimulate the economy.

“Obviously, there’s an environmental component to this,” Eisenberg says. “We want to clean up the environment. But there’s also a jobs component to this, and we don’t want that to be ignored.”

The Stanford researchers recommended improved, broader public messaging about the benefits of solar panels and backup battery systems.","According to a new study, the proposed termination of federal clean energy tax credits will impact the payback period for people who own solar panels.

When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates currently available tax credits at the end of 2025, solar panels will become less economically viable for many people.

As Stanford University shared, researchers recently assessed the affordability of solar and backup battery systems in the U.S. They found that most U.S. households can reduce their energy costs with these clean energy solutions in the current market. However, costs are set to increase due to recent federal policy changes.

According to the study, the lost tax credits would bring the percentage of U.S. households for which solar/battery systems make financial sense down from 60% to 32%.

After analyzing more than 500,000 representative households, the Stanford University researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Energy.

They also suggested that ""people may need to buy the equipment by Dec. 31"" to ensure their new rooftop solar panels and battery packs will reduce electricity bills. Taking advantage of the tax credits could also help provide cost-effective energy resilience during power outages.

As the researchers noted, another factor to consider is how much homeowners will get paid for excess solar, which can affect how long it will take for them to recoup their investment.

In some states, homeowners will see less money when selling their excess electricity to local utility companies, which can lengthen the time it will take to earn the money back for the initial installment of the panels. As Stanford shared, ""More than one-third of homes today are in states that pay residential solar owners based on how much their electricity saves the local utility, which is almost always lessen paying homeowners their full electricity rate. The number of states adopting this policy is rising.""

The researchers noted that in some states, such as Iowa, Idaho, and Washington, utility companies are still required to pay homeowners the higher price for their excess solar power.

This research is insightful because it highlights the impressive cost-saving potential of solar energy while preparing homeowners for the realities of selling excess electricity. It also emphasizes the urgent need for pro-climate policies that support a sustainable planet for the future.

Meanwhile, other research teams have been sharing what they've discovered about the decreasing costs of solar power. Recent technological breakthroughs could make solar panels even more efficient as well.

If you act now, you could still qualify for valuable solar tax incentives and start saving money on your monthly bills.

With or without those tax credits, EnergySage is helping homeowners save up to $10,000 on their solar installations. EnergySage's free services include a local installer quote comparison tool and a mapping tool that shows incentives in each state.

If buying solar panels isn't within your budget, consider leasing them for no money down through Palmetto's LightReach program.

Pairing solar panels with a heat pump can save you even more on your energy bills. Mitsubishi can help you find the heat pump and installer that's right for you.

The Stanford researchers recommended improved, broader public messaging about the benefits of solar panels and backup battery systems. They also noted that low adoption in rural and disadvantaged communities only worsens historical inequities.

""Rooftop solar and battery storage, deployed together or separately, offer promising adaptation solutions as they may help to reduce electricity bills, provide backup power during outages, and lower carbon emissions,"" they wrote. ""Policymakers can directly shape this landscape through tariff design, incentive programs, rate approvals, and industry regulations.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panel-adoptionimage-recRhnXYVTtdEj14I-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 03:19:27.444893

Energy Fuels Inc. (TSX: EFR / NYSE: UUUU) has emerged as a cornerstone player in North America's pursuit of critical mineral self-sufficiency. The company's evolution from uranium-focused operations to a comprehensive Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain architect represents a fundamental shift in how Western economies approach strategic mineral security. This dual-commodity positioning addresses both immediate energy needs through uranium production and long-term technological independence through rare earth element processing.

The convergence of geopolitical tensions and clean energy transitions has created unprecedented urgency around domestic mineral processing capabilities. Furthermore, Energy Fuels occupies a unique position at this intersection, leveraging existing infrastructure and regulatory approvals to address supply chain vulnerabilities that have developed over decades of offshoring critical mineral processing to China.

Revolutionary Domestic Processing Infrastructure

White Mesa Mill: America's Strategic Asset

The White Mesa Mill in Utah stands as the only licensed facility in North America capable of processing monazite mineral concentrates into separated rare earth oxides. This facility holds dual licensing from the Utah Division of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, providing the regulatory framework necessary for handling radioactive materials inherent in monazite processing.

Current Production Specifications:

• Phase 1 Capacity: 1,000 metric tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide annually

• Expansion Targets: 4,000-6,000 metric tons with Phase 2-3 developments

• Heavy Rare Earth Timeline: Commercial production targeted for Q4 2026

• Strategic Coverage: Capability to produce six of seven oxides currently subject to Chinese export restrictions

The facility's monazite processing capability represents a critical breakthrough in Western supply chain independence. Moreover, monazite concentrates contain approximately 3-12% thorium content, requiring specialised handling expertise that Energy Fuels possesses through its uranium milling operations. This technical knowledge barrier has historically limited Western rare earth processing development, making the White Mesa Mill's operational status particularly significant.

Advanced Separation Technology Implementation

Energy Fuels employs sophisticated chemical separation processes that transform raw monazite concentrates into high-purity rare earth oxides meeting stringent manufacturing specifications. In addition, the Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain processing involves multiple technical stages:

Acid Digestion Phase: Monazite dissolution using hydrochloric or sulfuric acid systems to separate rare earth elements from gangue minerals

Thorium Isolation: Radioactive thorium separation and containment following NRC regulatory protocols

Selective Precipitation: Individual rare earth oxide separation through controlled crystallisation chemistry

Calcination Processing: Final oxide purification to achieve 99.5%+ purity levels required for permanent magnet applications

The company has successfully qualified its high-purity NdPr oxide for use in permanent magnet manufacturing applications. This represents a crucial milestone in establishing complete domestic supply chain control from raw materials to finished components, particularly relevant to current critical minerals energy transition initiatives.

Multi-Continental Feedstock Security Strategy

Diversified Supply Architecture

Energy Fuels has constructed a geographically diverse feedstock acquisition strategy that reduces dependency on any single supplier or region. This approach directly addresses concentration risks that have historically plagued Western rare earth supply chains.

Feedstock Source Location Material Type Annual Capacity Target Development Status Chemours Partnership Florida/Georgia, USA Monazite concentrates 1,000-1,500 t NdPr oxide Operational Donald Project Victoria, Australia Heavy mineral sands 7,000-8,000 t concentrates Late 2027 target Toliara Deposit Madagascar Monazite-bearing sands Under assessment Evaluation phase Brazilian Operations Brazil Heavy mineral sands Development pending Planning stage

The Chemours partnership represents an innovative circular economy application, transforming previously discarded phosphate production byproducts into valuable rare earth feedstock. However, this arrangement provides immediate operational feedstock while Energy Fuels develops international mining partnerships for long-term supply security.

Heavy Mineral Sands vs. Monazite Processing

The Donald Project in Australia introduces xenotime-bearing heavy mineral sands to the Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain, complementing existing monazite processing capabilities. Furthermore, xenotime contains significantly higher concentrations of heavy rare earths (dysprosium, terbium, yttrium) compared to monazite, addressing critical supply gaps in the most strategically important rare earth elements.

Processing Differentiation:

• Xenotime Chemistry: Requires different acid digestion and separation sequences than monazite

• Heavy REE Concentration: Contains 30-60% heavy rare earths versus 5-10% in monazite

• Supply Reliability: Production tied to established heavy minerals mining operations rather than chemical industry byproducts

Addressing Critical Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Breaking Chinese Processing Monopoly

China currently controls approximately 85-90% of global rare earth processing capacity, creating significant strategic vulnerabilities for Western manufacturers. This concentration has increased despite growth in mining capacity in other regions, highlighting the critical importance of processing capabilities over raw ore availability.

Recent Chinese export control actions have demonstrated the weaponisation potential of rare earth supply chains:

• August 2023: Restrictions implemented on gallium and germanium exports

• July 2024: New export controls requiring government approval for rare earth processing exports

• September 2024: Graphite export restrictions expanded critical minerals export control strategy

The United States currently imports approximately 100% of refined rare earth oxides and has zero domestic processing capacity for rare earth separation outside of Energy Fuels' operations. Consequently, this dependency creates single-point-of-failure risks where geopolitical actions can disrupt supply chains for defence systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy infrastructure.

Domestic Content Compliance Solutions

Energy Fuels' domestic processing capabilities enable manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent domestic content requirements across defence and clean energy sectors. The Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain provides:

Supply Diversification: Alternative sourcing to Chinese processors reducing geopolitical concentration risk

Regulatory Compliance: Domestic processing enables ""Buy American"" and critical minerals procurement regulation compliance

Supply Chain Transparency: Complete traceability from feedstock to finished oxides meeting defence sector requirements

Strategic Independence: Access to materials not subject to potential foreign export restrictions or trade disputes

These capabilities align with the broader critical minerals strategy being implemented across Western economies.

Financial Architecture and Investment Implications

Capital Deployment Strategy

Energy Fuels' $700 million convertible debt offering represents the scale of capital investment required to establish rare earth processing capabilities in Western markets. This financing structure provides operational flexibility during the ramp-up phase whilst offering future equity participation for investors.

The convergence of geopolitical tensions, clean energy growth mandates, and defence modernisation requirements creates favourable conditions for Western rare earth suppliers. However, investors should carefully evaluate the speculative nature of revenue projections and the complexity of executing integrated supply chain development across multiple jurisdictions.

Investment Timeline Considerations:

The Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain development represents a multi-year investment thesis requiring patience for project execution and market development. Near-term financial performance will likely remain dominated by uranium operations whilst rare earth revenues gradually scale toward projected levels.

Disclaimer: This analysis contains forward-looking statements and projections that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected outcomes due to market conditions, execution challenges, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond company control. Investors should conduct independent due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

The transformation of North American critical mineral independence through companies like Energy Fuels represents a fundamental shift in global supply chain architecture. Success in this transformation will depend on sustained execution, favourable market conditions, and continued geopolitical support for domestic supply chain development initiatives.

US automakers are beginning to scale back their EV manufacturing plans following the untimely demise of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, so now is probably not the best time to beef up the domestic supply chain for EV batteries. Nevertheless, the leading Indian energy storage firm Epsilon Advanced Materials has locked in a supply of precursors to feed its forthcoming graphite anode factory in North Carolina. EAM anticipates that the new facility will pump out enough product to supply about 1 million made-in-the-USA EVs per year, once it achieves full production capacity. Are they nuts?

More Graphite For More EV Batteries … Nope, Epsilon Is Not Nuts

Taking a closer look at that production timeline, EAM is not nuts. They are simply planning ahead. In September, the company reported that the necessary permits are all lined up and the facility is on track to commence operations in 2027, with a 50% capacity target of 30,000 tons, or enough to supply 500,000 EVs.

That’s a little more consistent with the consensus on the near-term outlook for EV sales in the US. Sales spiked leading up to September 30 as buyers rushed to make last-minute deals before the tax credit expired, only to slump precipitously in October after the tax credit vanished. However, auto industry analysts do not generally anticipate that interest in EVs will evaporate entirely. State, dealer, and automaker incentives are still available to some EV bargain hunters, and the potential for savings on TCO (total cost of ownership, including fuel and maintenance) may help keep the EV market treading water for the time being.

In the meantime, the public EV charging network is continuing to grow, offering EV-curious car buyers more confidence in the availability of public and home charging stations. By the time EAM’s new anode factory hits its full production capacity of 60,000 in 2030, federal energy policy may also provide more support. After all, the current occupant of the White House is scheduled to leave office on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes.

A Lower Carbon Footprint For EV Batteries

EAM has also nailed down a precursor supply sufficient to reach the 30,000- and 60,000-ton goal posts. In September, the company entered into an Agreement in Principle with Phillips 66 to supply green and calcined needle coke from its refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Coke is a byproduct of oil refining and coal gasification. So, not particularly green. Nevertheless, it is an essential feature of the EV battery supply chain of today.

“Phillips 66 is among the world’s leading producers of specialty cokes, such as Green and Calcined Needle Coke, which are critical for manufacturing synthetic graphite anodes,” EAM explains, adding that the agreement “brings together Phillips 66’s operational expertise with EAM’s global expansion, reinforcing efforts to build a competitive and resilient supply chain for clean energy technologies across multiple regions.”

As for the decarbonized EV battery supply chain of tomorrow, that’s where things get interesting. Back in 2017, the US Department of Energy identified silicon as an alternative anode material. Aside from reducing the use of fossil-derived materials in the EV battery supply chain, silicon is less expensive than its graphite counterpart.

The Long Road To The Silicon Anode Of The Future

There being no such thing as a free lunch, in 2017 the Energy Department noted that EV battery cells based on silicon and other next generation materials “still suffer major cycle and calendar life issues.”

In particular, silicon anodes degrade over time, aside from degradation directly linked to charging cycles. By 2017, Energy Department researchers identified the nut of the problem, consisting of lithium lost due to reactivity with the electrolyte.

The next steps involved experimenting with salts and electrolyte solvents to stabilize the reaction. By 2021, the Energy Department was all in. The agency tapped its National Renewable Energy Laboratory to lead a new, pumped-up silicon EV battery R&D effort called the Silicon Consortium Project, to be focused like a thousand points of light on solving the calendar-life challenge. SCP combined the Energy Department’s ongoing Silicon Electrolyte Interface Stabilization project and the Silicon Deep Dive program into one multidisciplinary team drawn from the Argonne, Sandia, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories.

“Together, the national laboratories employ advanced characterization techniques coupled with state-of-the-art research facilities to explore the foundational science of organic electrolytes with silicon interfaces to develop the full electrode and cell chemistry,” NREL explained.

“Researchers aim to use these findings to take advantage of silicon’s ability to store more than 3,500 milliamp hours per gram, which could reduce battery pack size by 25%–30%, or increase driving range by 30%–40% with packs the same size as those found in current EVs,” the lab added.

More & Better Silicon EV Batteries

The Energy Department tasked SCP to produce silicon-based anodes with a calendar life of 10+ years, among other attributes leading to the more affordable EV battery of the future. Private sector innovators have not been asleep at the wheel, either. In 2o22, for example, General Motors announced a silicon EV battery deal with the US startup OneD Battery Sciences.

“Silicon can store ten times the energy of graphite alone,” OneD observed. “Being able to add larger amounts of silicon — efficiently — is the essential breakthrough needed to produce competitive EVs that meet market demand for high-performance, affordable vehicles.”

OneD’s “SINANODE” anode is based on graphite infused with silicon nanowires. At the time of the hookup, GM noted that OneD was continuing R&D work on its anode solution while scaling into pilot production. In the latest development, last week OneD announced a joint development agreement with the Chinese carbon materials specialist Shanghai Putailai New Energy Technology Co., aimed at scaling up production.

“Through this agreement, we will combine OneD’s SINANODE technology with Putailai’s world-class graphite manufacturing to deliver higher energy density cells at affordable cost,” emphasized OneD CEO Jeff Chamberlain in a press statement.

They better not let the grass grow under their feet. In September, the US materials startup Sila Nanomaterials announced the start of production at its silicon anode plant in Moses Lake, Washington. EV batteries are the target market along with consumer electronics, drones, satellites, and other applications.

As with EAM, Sila anticipates that EV sales in the US will recover from this year’s counterproductive federal policy. “Operations will initially support 2–5 GWh of capacity, with the capability to expand up to 250 GWh within five years and become the largest anode production facility in the world,” Sila states.

“By manufacturing domestically at unprecedented scale, Sila is replacing graphite, a critical mineral overwhelmingly sourced from China, with a higher-performing, American-made alternative at a time when U.S. manufacturers are acutely focused on cutting supply chain vulnerabilities,” the company also reminds everyone.

In April 2025, the cabinet approved 1,500 electric buses for big cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Multan.

However, owing to high capital costs, rapid evolution of product technologies, limited operational experience and lack of trained personnel, the adoption of electric buses has been slow worldwide.","mog has become a tragic marker of Lahore’s winter. Every year, the city of over 13 million residents turns grey with pollutants blurring its skyline. Every year a number of people, including children, end up in hospitals reporting respiratory problems.

The provincial government has faced its fair share of criticism for its failure to address the issue and provide relief.

This year, too, the authorities have been sharing mitigation strategies to cope with the smog. The Lahore Waste Management Company has has deployed 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling. The citizens have been told to wear face masks. Health professionals have advised children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory or heart conditions to take suitable precautions and reduce outdoor exposure. The police are conducting a crackdown on various kinds of behaviours contributing to smog.

The government has also rolled out electric buses, promising cleaner air and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.

Under the Green Transport initiative, the pilot project was started with 27 buses plying on a 21-kilometre route, aiming to serve around 17,000 commuters a day. By September 2025, another 35 buses had been added. In October, 40 more were launched. The eventual target is 500 buses in the first phase. According to the Transport Department 1,500 buses will be running by the end of 2025 in various districts of the Punjab.

The government’s current approach is guided by its Green Transport Initiative, an offshoot of the National Electric Vehicle Policy 2020. This framework envisions the gradual replacement of fossil-fuel vehicles across categories, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars and buses. In March 2024, the chief minister formally approved the procurement of 657 eco-friendly urban buses. Plans were also announced for 2,000 EV charging stations across the Punjab in 2025. In April 2025, the cabinet approved 1,500 electric buses for big cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Multan.

Pollution

Meanwhile, Lahore’s Air Quality Index regularly soars to 400 and beyond. So, have the electric buses made a visible impact on Lahore’s air quality? Will the 1,500 buses cause a noticeable change in the Punjab?

An article titled Air-Pollution and Economics: Diesel Bus Versus Electric Bus written by SR Adheesh, M Shravanth Vasisht and Sheela K Ramasesha for Divecha Centre for Climate Change says that an electric bus prevents 73 tons of CO emissions annually. It also reduces fossil fuel use by 30,000 litres per year. The reduced exposure to PM 2.5 reduces the risk for those suffering from asthma and cardiovascular diseases. With a large enough number of buses the cumulative gains lower hospital admissions, missed workdays and healthcare costs.

In Lahore, smog has been found to result from a combination of transport emissions, crop residue burning, industrial pollution and brick kilns pollution. According to the Environmental Protection Department, transport vehicles contribute 43 per cent of the particulate emissions. Electrifying public transport can therefore have a significant effect. Experts say that this should go hand-in-hand with policies on industrial emissions, fuel regulation and crop-management practices.

The scale

Dr Imran Khalid, a climate and environment expert, said that compared with the magnitude and scale of the pollution in Lahore, 67 electric buses are barely a drop in the bucket.

“You can’t expect measurable improvement simply by introducing electric buses. This is just one part of the puzzle that requires a number of pieces to align together including introduction of cleaner fuels, improving quality of vehicles on the road and eliminating other sources of air pollution.”

He proposes incentives for replacing older vehicles and consensus-building through awareness campaigns, rather than relying solely on threats of fines and factory closures .

While the chief minister has called the electric buses the first step toward a pollution-free Punjab, experts say meaningful progress will require a lot more. They urge phasing out diesel vehicles, linking charging stations to solar power and integrating routes and ticketing with the Metro bus and Orange Line systems.

Dr Khalid also says that while electric buses eliminate tailpipe emissions, substantially reducing local air pollution, electricity sourced from fossil fuel based plants will still cause pollution around those facilities.

“The net air quality improvement hinges on the grid’s energy mix. Reliance on fossil fuels sustains emissions of particulate matter, NOx and SO2. For meaningful progress, the electric bus initiative must be accompanied by a shift to renewable energy generation.”

In conversation with TNS, activist Ahmad Rafay Alam said electronic buses were a fantastic idea. “But to think they’ll fix air pollution on their own is being overly optimistic. Thousands of e-buses and a robust public transport network are just one part of a strategy needed to deal with air pollution.”

He said the national electric power grid still relied heavily on fossil fuels. He said that if all the proposed measures to control pollution sources are implemented in a sustainable way, it will take 5 to 10 years for a 15 to 20 per cent reduction in the overall pollution.”

Meanwhile, according to the Traffic Police, Lahore has approximately 4.2 million motorcycles and 6.2 million other vehicles.

Public transport

Talking to TNS, an official of Punjab Transport Company said that currently there are 67 operational electric busses in Lahore. Besides there are 188 Speedo (diesel) busses, 64 Metro buses that also run on diesel and ten older diesel buses mostly on routes out of the city and 53 vans. Environmental activists say that the number of vans is much higher. Some of those are apparently not on the PTC radar.

“Qingqi rikshaws are the priority transport for many. These are easily available and have the price advantage. Then there are vans that provide pick and drop services for schools etc. There are hundreds of such vans,” said Nida Afzal, a climate activist.

About the electric buses, she said the policy making as well as execution should be participative and accountable. Else, the project will lose steam and wither like some earlier public transport initiatives.

Success stories

Experience in other cities and countries has shown that, when rolled out systematically, electric buses can dramatically cut urban pollution. A good example is China. A World Bank report, Electrification of Public Transport: A Case Study of Shenzhen Bus Group, says that China has achieved large-scale electrification of urban buses. Shenzhen, which in 2017 became the first city globally to have fully electrified its bus fleet, achieved similar success with its taxis two years later. But China did not just buy buses, it built an entire ecosystem, including local battery manufacturing, renewable-energy charging grids and maintenance facilities.

The report says that the transition to electrification requires coordination and policy synergy across various levels of governments as well as different departments within the governments. Private players especially in vehicle manufacturing, charging and new technology are also critical. The ultimate users of the service are passengers, who should not be neglected. Shenzhen’s success in electrifying its entire bus fleet in a short period of time was a joint effort by private and public entities.

The report mentions that electrification of public transport provides an opportunity to achieve multiple objectives: low-carbon urban development, reduction of local air pollution, creation of jobs, and higher acceptance of public transport by residents.

However, owing to high capital costs, rapid evolution of product technologies, limited operational experience and lack of trained personnel, the adoption of electric buses has been slow worldwide.

The way forward

Activist Rida Rashid says, “If our decisions were driven by research… we wouldn’t be choking every winter. Smog isn’t a seasonal event, it’s a yearlong governance failure. To overcome the air pollution crisis our governance has to include data, transit planning, fuel standards, enforcement and most importantly accountability.”

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t just a policy—it’s a blueprint for scaling your business.","If you’re building or expanding a manufacturing business in clean energy, understanding the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth could be the key that unlocks millions in new capital. This isn’t just another tax incentive—it’s a cash-flow machine designed to reward U.S. manufacturers that produce the components powering the renewable economy.

Let’s break down exactly how to use the 45X Credit to fuel your own manufacturing growth.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth is a production-based incentive created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to encourage companies to build clean energy components in the United States.

Here’s what makes it different: instead of rewarding installations or projects, it rewards production. Every eligible item you manufacture—like battery cells, solar modules, wind turbine blades, or critical minerals—earns you a dollar-for-dollar tax credit.

Think of it like this: the more you produce, the more you earn.

That means for manufacturers, recyclers, and suppliers in the clean energy supply chain, 45X isn’t just about sustainability—it’s a recurring revenue stream that can be monetized, sold, or reinvested into expansion.

Manufacturing has always been capital-intensive, but the 45X credit changes the math. For the first time, U.S. manufacturers can compete globally with built-in government-backed financial leverage.

When the IRA passed, the U.S. government effectively said: “If you build it here, we’ll help you pay for it.”

Here’s what that means in plain terms:

You get paid for every component produced, not just completed projects.

You can sell your credits through transferability or receive direct cash payments.

You can stack credits (like 48C and 45X) to maximize ROI.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth gives companies predictable income while reducing the risk of scaling. That’s a rare combination in manufacturing finance.

Before the IRA, most clean energy incentives were limited to project-level developers—solar farms, wind farms, or utilities. Manufacturers often got left out. The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth fixed that by focusing directly on the people who make the parts.

Three updates made this credit a game-changer:

Transferability – Companies can sell credits for cash to other taxpayers.

Direct Pay – Qualifying entities can receive the credit as a refund, even without tax liability.

Phase-In Window – The credit runs through 2032, giving manufacturers a full decade to capitalize.

This turns a complicated tax incentive into a liquidity tool—fueling investment, expansion, and job creation.

Start by analyzing your production process. Which of your components fall under the 45X eligibility list? If you’re already manufacturing solar, wind, battery, or hydrogen equipment, you’re likely eligible.

If you’re still planning your facility, design it with 45X in mind. Many companies are now reverse-engineering production strategies to maximize eligibility—producing higher-margin components that qualify for larger credits.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t a flat percentage—it’s a per-unit system. Each product type earns a fixed amount.

For example:

Battery cells = $35 per kWh produced.

Battery modules = $10 per kWh.

Solar cells = $0.04 per watt.

Those numbers add up quickly. A mid-sized battery plant producing 500 MWh annually could earn $17.5 million per year in credits—and that’s before stacking other incentives.

At Icarus Fund, we help clients model these values against their cost structure to estimate exactly how much credit they can generate annually and how to integrate that into long-term financing.

Here’s where things get fun. The 45X credit doesn’t just sit on your balance sheet—it can power your financing strategy.

You can:

Pre-sell credits to investors for upfront cash.

Use credits as collateral to secure loans.

Stack 45X with 48C (which offsets facility upgrade costs).

We once worked with a solar inverter manufacturer that used 45X projections as leverage to secure $30 million in expansion funding. Their bank called it “non-dilutive equity”—because it functioned like capital without selling ownership.

That’s the secret: treat your tax credits like financial assets, not paperwork.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t just a policy—it’s a blueprint for scaling your business. If you’re producing clean energy components, this is your window to expand, secure funding, and dominate your sector.

At Icarus Fund, we specialize in turning clean energy tax credits into working capital that fuels real growth.

Rajeev YSR, CEO of ThunderPlus, outlines how bidirectional charging, combined with innovations like ethanol-powered mobile rapid chargers, can stabilise grids, support off-grid areas, and accelerate India’s journey towards net-zero by 2070. He also highlights the policies, infrastructure, and industry collaboration needed to scale V2G nationwide.

Can V2G and bidirectional charging be a game-changer for renewable energy?

V2G and bidirectional charging are the natural evolution of India’s renewable journey. At ThunderPlus, we already operate 1,000+ chargers across 250 hubs, dispensing 10 MWh daily and recently introduced, with Trinity Cleantech and ME Energy, the world’s first 150 kW bioethanol-based mobile rapid charger cum generator. This grid-independent innovation produces energy from bioethanol and supports off-grid charging, closing a critical gap in India’s EV ecosystem. V2G takes this vision further by allowing EVs to return energy to the grid, balancing supply and demand in renewable-heavy regions. While current vehicle volumes limit scale, such technologies align with Hon. Minister Nitin Gadkari’s call for energy self-reliance and Atmanirbhar Bharat, turning every EV into a micro power plant.

What’s the potential impact of V2G on renewable energy and decarbonisation?

V2G has the potential to transform EVs into mobile renewable storage assets. ThunderPlus envisions its nationwide charging network as an ‘energy bank’ that balances solar and biofuel-based generation. Our collaboration with ME Energy, where ethanol powers a rapid charger to generate clean electricity anywhere, is a prototype of distributed renewable power. In the short term, V2G can support localised grids in fleet hubs and highway corridors; in the long term, it will help India achieve its net-zero by 2070 goal by offsetting peak-hour coal dependency. If even 15 percent of India’s EVs become V2G-enabled by 2030, they could unlock gigawatts of flexible capacity and significantly decarbonise transport and power simultaneously.

What steps are needed for integration of V2G-enabled EVs into the grid?

Three elements must align: standardisation, smart grid infrastructure, and pilot-scale commercialisation. ThunderPlus has already adopted OCPP 2.0 protocols and is working with utilities to test bidirectional communication and dynamic load management. Our ethanol-based mobile chargers demonstrate that clean energy can be generated and dispensed anywhere without grid dependency, a precursor to V2G deployment in rural and off-grid zones. We anticipate commercial V2G pilots by FY 2027-28, especially in industrial parks and fleet depots. Ultimately, each ThunderPlus hub is being engineered as a future-ready node for both energy delivery and energy return.

What type of government policies or incentives are required for V2G to work?

Policies should treat EVs as mobile energy assets, not just vehicles. India needs two-way metering, V2G tariffs, and renewable credit mechanisms to reward users feeding energy back to the grid. FAME-III can accelerate this through V2G pilot subsidies and tax incentives for bidirectional chargers. The ThunderPlus – ME Energy bio-ethanol charger is a live example of how innovation and policy can merge to build Atmanirbhar energy solutions. Government support for off-grid, renewable-based charging models will make India a global leader in sustainable energy mobility.

How can the auto industry overcome infrastructure and interoperability complexities?

Standardisation and collaboration are key. ThunderPlus has already integrated over 10 OEM technologies into one interoperable back-end platform across its network. Bi-directional chargers are currently 20–30 percent costlier, but as seen with our ethanol-powered rapid charger, localised manufacturing and indigenous innovation can drastically reduce costs. When EVs and charging infrastructure operate under open standards, economics improve through scale and shared energy revenue models. ThunderPlus is proving that sustainability and profitability can coexist by turning every parked vehicle and charging hub into an active participant in India’s energy transition.

What milestones and infrastructure developments are needed for mass adoption?

India’s next milestone is to link EV charging with energy generation. ThunderPlus and ME Energy’s bioethanol-based charger is the first step, offering rapid charging that is mobile, eco-friendly, and grid-independent. Over the next five years, ThunderPlus plans to expand V2G-ready hubs across all major corridors, integrated with solar and biofuel sources. National standards, utility integration, and open data infrastructure will be critical to scale this vision. Once EV penetration crosses 25 percent and renewable capacity is digitally managed, mass adoption of V2G will become a reality, making India’s mobility and energy systems mutually reinforcing.

What are the concerns about battery degradation?

Battery degradation is a valid concern, but technology is advancing faster than fear. Today’s batteries offer 2,000–3,000 cycles (8–10 years of use), and new chemistries like LFP and solid-state extend that significantly. ThunderPlus monitors battery health data from its charging network to optimise charging profiles and minimise wear. Our bio-ethanol chargers also enable controlled charging in areas without grid fluctuations, reducing stress on cells. By the time V2G reaches commercial scale, AI-driven battery management and better chemistries will ensure that battery life is not just preserved but enhanced through intelligent energy exchange.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/08/Untitled-design-4.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 01:58:17.385760

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products cost more and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the U.S. auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion U.S. auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the U.S. and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help U.S. car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s policies are costing drivers more

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The U.S. auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond U.S. shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the U.S. and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LinesofCars.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-09 04:58:16.531693

The paper, titled Re-anchoring CBDR-RC in Human Development and SDGs for Climate Justice, redefines the global climate discourse by linking human development and energy consumption to operationalize equity and justice. Authored by Dr Shailly Kedia, Senior Fellow, TERI, with contributions from Pujeet Jha, Researcher, TERI School of Advanced Studies, and reviewed by Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former Principal Negotiator for Climate Change at the UNFCCC, the study offers a measurable approach to the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)—a cornerstone of the UNFCCC.

The paper notes that 10 years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the balance between climate ambition and development remains uneven. Global focus has tilted toward emissions metrics, while the developmental foundations of climate justice–equity, capability, and human well-being–have receded to the background. The study establishes a strong empirical linkage between human development and energy access, showing that energy poverty is human poverty. Without reliable and affordable power, no country can provide healthcare, education, or livelihoods.

Using the 2000-Watt Society as a benchmark, the paper sets a sustainable and equitable energy use goal of 2000 watts (48 kWh per day) per person—aligning efficiency and sufficiency with quality of life. It argues that this benchmark can anchor SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) while linking energy sufficiency to dignity and development.

India’s per capita energy consumption currently stands at 866 watts—less than half the sustainable benchmark—while high-income economies average more than 6,000 watts. The paper highlights that achieving climate justice demands addressing both underconsumption in developing countries and overconsumption in high-income countries. To operationalize CBDR-RC, the study maps 187 countries based on their per capita energy consumption and Human Development Index (HDI) levels, classifying them into eight zones—each representing a different stage in the balance between development and sustainability.

The framework transforms equity from a static principle into a dynamic, measurable tool, enabling countries to pursue differentiated yet complementary trajectories:

Zone 1 (68 countries): Very high HDI and excessive energy consumption, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and many EU countries. These countries must lead deep decarbonization and support developing countries through means of implementation especially finance and technology.

Zone 2 (15 countries): Emerging economies such as China, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia, which must balance human development with decoupling growth from emissions.

Zone 3 (2 countries): Medium-HDI countries nearing balance between energy use and human development.

Zone 4 (no country): No low-HDI country has high energy consumption, underscoring the absence of overconsumption among the poor.

Zone 5 (26 countries): Low human development and extremely low per capita energy consumption, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These countries face severe energy poverty and high vulnerability.

Zone 6 (40 countries): Lower-middle-income countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria. These countries must expand energy access for development while staying within sustainable limits.

Zone 7 (33 countries): High-HDI countries with moderate energy use that remain vulnerable and should strive for resilience.

Zone 8 (3 countries): Albania, Costa Rica, and North Macedonia, which have achieved very high HDI with relatively low energy consumption.

This HDI–Energy Zoning Framework provides a scientific and ethical foundation for a Zone of Climate Justice, where sustainable energy use and high human development coexist.

The study traces the evolution of CBDR-RC from static differentiation under the UNFCCC to self-differentiation under the Paris Agreement. However, it warns that this evolution has diluted the operational meaning of equity.

By integrating data on energy and HDI, the paper redefines CBDR-RC as a living principle—capable of evolving with changing capacities and responsibilities.

As the world approaches COP30, TERI calls for re-anchoring climate cooperation in equity, responsibility, and shared prosperity. Incremental pledges alone will not achieve just transitions; the coming decade must bridge climate ambition and human development.

Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, said: “COP30 needs to recognize that equity and just transitions cannot be achieved through incremental pledges. It demands a re-anchoring of global cooperation in the principles of equity, responsibility, and shared prosperity through human development and equitable clean energy access.”

Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former Principal Negotiator for Climate Change at the UNFCCC observed: “This paper is an attempt to define the principle of equity and CBDR and differentiate nations based on their share in per capita energy consumption which is closely linked to SDGs. It gives an ethical basis of actions under the Paris Agreement.”

Dr Shailly Kedia, Senior Fellow, TERI, added: “Energy poverty is human poverty. Access to reliable and affordable power is fundamental to healthcare, education, and livelihoods. This paper calls for re-anchoring climate justice through Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), anchored in human development and equitable energy use within a Zone of Climate Justice.”

As the paper concludes, “A climate regime divorced from development cannot deliver justice, and development pathways divorced from planetary limits cannot deliver sustainability.”

The paper is part of TERI’s Act4Earth initiative under the SDG Charter, which aims to bridge gaps between climate ambition and sustainable development through evidence-based policy frameworks and global dialogue.

In a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the groups called on the regulator to require price disclosure on the cost of trucks and for manufacturers to publish prices at least twice annually. The submission adds that truck prices “are negotiated behind closed doors, and vary widely between buyers”, giving “manufacturers extraordinary market power—allowing them to extract higher prices from public programs and private fleets alike, with little accountability.""

California’s Clean Truck & Bus Vouchers program has allocated $1.7 billion to date.

A study conducted this year by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) showed the cost of electric Class 8 heavy trucks in the U.S. jumped by 27% ($87,100) between 2020 and 2025, while the cost of a similar truck in Europe fell by 23%.

The median price of a model year 2024 battery-electric heavy-duty tractor truck in the United States, according to ICCT, is $379,800—roughly 2.5 times the price of a combustion engine tractor. In China, the median price of the same class and type of vehicle is $119,600.

“Opaque pricing has become the norm, distorting competition, undermining public trust, and limiting the ability of small fleets and independent owner operators to participate in the clean vehicle transition,” the groups charged in their submission to CARB.

In a letter to New York Governor Kathy Hochul with recommendations for the state’s Interagency Working Group to Accelerate Clean Vehicle Adoption, a coalition of advocates including Earthjustice, Alliance for Clean Energy New York, and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign call for “pricing clarity and market fairness.""

“To ensure public funds are efficiently deployed, New York should explore requiring full price disclosure as a condition of receiving state incentive funds,” the submission added.

Both Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council also submitted comments in response to a public dialogue period on Washington state’s ZEVergreen Initiative, calling on Washington Department of Ecology to adopt similar measures to promote price transparency in truck sales.

Complicated path to zero

Trucking's path to zero emissions is currently being litigated.

Just minutes after President Donald Trump signed in June a trio of resolutions that ended California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) electric vehicle mandates and strict diesel-emissions standards, the state doubled down on its commitment to clean cars and trucks.

Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order further advancing California’s clean vehicle transition and kickstarting development of next-generation policy to spur innovation, updating state vehicle purchasing requirements, and directing the state to develop new actions to accelerate affordable clean vehicle adoption.

U.S. District Judge Dena Coggins last week issued a preliminary injunction barring California from enforcing the terms of the Clean Truck Partnership CARB signed with truck and engine manufacturers. Daimler Truck North America (DTNA), PACCAR, International Motors, and Volvo Group North America (VGNA) sought an injunction in a lawsuit filed in August, arguing that when President Donald Trump in June walked back Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency waivers relating to California's Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulations and its Omnibus Low NOx (Omnibus) rule, it also voided the CTP.

In September, CARB submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding, noting that the EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/4gen-logistics-vnr-electric-customer-event.DQfn1dnhgi.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-08 20:59:11.632221

Speaking at the Energy Transition Roundtable during the Belém Climate Summit on November 7, he said last year 90 per cent of new power capacity came from renewables.

""Global investment in clean energy reached two trillion US dollars - eight hundred billion more than fossil fuels,"" Guterres said. ""Renewables are now the cheapest source of new electricity in nearly every country. They are powering prosperity and empowering communities long left in the dark.""

He highlighted the economic impact of clean energy, noting that every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels. ""Clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide. The renewables revolution is here,"" he said.

""But we must go much faster - and ensure all nations share the benefits,"" Guterres added.

At COP28, countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly, and equitable manner; to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. ""The mandate is clear - now we must close the delivery gap,"" the UN chief said.

He warned that even if all new national commitments are fully implemented, the world is still on track for more than 2°C of warming, resulting in more floods, heat, and suffering worldwide. Scientists now say overshooting 1.5°C is inevitable, starting at the latest in the early 2030s. How high and how long the overshoot lasts, he said, depends on the speed and scale of global action today.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres outlined five key actions to accelerate the global energy transition. He called for clarity and coherence, urging countries to align laws, policies, and incentives with a just energy transition while eliminating fossil fuel subsidies that distort markets.

Guterres emphasised the need to put people and equity at the centre of the transition. He said workers and communities dependent on coal, oil, and gas must be supported with training, protection, and new opportunities, especially for young people and women.

He highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment, noting that grids, storage, and efficiency must be expanded rapidly to keep pace with the surging growth of renewable energy.

The UN chief also stressed that all new electricity demand must be met with clean power, including the energy used by data centres driving the AI revolution. Technology, he said, must be part of the solution, not a new source of strain.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","(The Hill) – In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.ksn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-09 12:19:23.690934

In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners.
In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles.
After the plan's reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state.
""The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times.","In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Californians have purchased home insurance from a state-managed ""last resort"" insurance pool that has grown rapidly as private insurance companies have fled the market.

Now, in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan is seeking approval from the state for an average 36% rate hike, which would further squeeze homeowners who have no other options for coverage.

Insurance experts say it's a national warning sign, as the effects of climate change cause private insurance companies to pull back on coverage in disaster-prone areas, leaving states and their residents to assume more of the risk. Fewer homeowners will be able to purchase private insurance in the future, and even those who do may face higher premiums as companies charge more to pay for the FAIR Plan losses.

In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners. The plans charge high premiums and provide limited coverage.

""It was supposed to be a stopgap measure. People are supposed to be on a FAIR Plan policy for a short amount of time, but with climate change and these extreme weather events, that's not going to happen,"" said Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit.

At present, 35 states and the District of Columbia offer FAIR Plans or Citizens Plans to home-owners who can't find coverage on the private market. The plans are managed by state governments, with the financial backing of the private insurers doing business in that state.

The plans maintain enough reserves to cover payouts for an average year. But when the plans take heavy losses, they impose an assessment on a pool of the insurance companies doing business in the state, based on their market share.

These state-managed plans were initially created to cover a small number of properties as a temporary, last-resort option. But now, as wildfires and hurricanes have pushed insurance companies to retreat from certain areas, FAIR Plans cover nearly 3 million properties nationwide, with an exposure exceeding $1 trillion, according to data issued last year by the Insurance Information Institute.

""If it's going to keep on growing, it becomes impossible to manage the risk,"" Douglas Heller, director of insurance with the Consumer Federation of America, a research and advocacy nonprofit, said in an interview earlier this year. ""It's OK if the high risk is just a small pool, but if the private sector is unwilling to take any of the highrisk [policies], that model doesn't work anymore.""

In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles. In the months before the fires, insurance companies had dropped coverage in many neighborhoods of the city, causing the state-backed insurer to take on policies covering billions of dollars.

The FAIR Plan was hit with $4 billion in losses when the fires wiped out many of the properties that had recently turned to the plan for coverage. After the plan's reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state. Some of those companies received permission to impose a surcharge on all their customers, residents not covered by the FAIR Plan, totaling more than $150 million so far, according to the Los Angeles Times.

This mechanism, which allows an assessment on all insurance policyholders in a state to make a state-managed plan solvent again, is known in Florida as the ""hurricane tax.""

In the wake of the California wildfires, the FAIR Plan is seeking an average 36% rate hike on homeowners in the plan, which the insurance pool says is necessary to keep up with the growing risks.

FAIR Plans typically provide only bare-bones coverage, and California's plan is facing lawsuits over its smoke damage policy. Now, the homeowners who rely on that plan could be facing much higher premiums for their coverage.

Some observers say the dire situation in California shows the unsustainable path many states are on as more and more residents lose coverage on the private market. California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts and North Carolina all have more than 100,000 properties insured by their state plans, according to the Insurance Information Institute's data.

A report authored by Pating, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, described a potential ""cycle of doom"" in which FAIR Plans assume more and more risk, taking heavy losses as climate change-driven weather events batter their states. Under this scenario, when the plans are forced to charge assessments on private insurers to replenish their reserves, more insurance companies retreat from doing business in the state, pushing even more residents on to the FAIR Plan.

""You'll see continued growth of these policies,"" Pating said. ""The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times. Every time an event happens, it's just going to get worse and worse.""

Pating called on states to use their FAIR Plans to incentivize hazard mitigation work — lowering premiums for property owners and communities who take steps to protect themselves from storms and wildfires. He said state regulators should also require more transparency from insurers about where they're dropping policies and raising premiums, which would help state officials better understand the risks.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 01:18:35.016085

Indiana to Host Advanced Small Reactor Energy Park

First American Nuclear and the State of Indiana Introduce the First “closed-fuel cycle” Nuclear Energy Park in the U.S.

Reprocessing and Reusing Spent Fuel Will Take Place Onsite Using a Fast Neutron Reactor

First American Nuclear (FANCO), developer of a fast-spectrum small modular reactor (SMR) and the State of Indiana announced this week plans to establish Indiana as the home of the company’s headquarters, manufacturing facilities, and an energy park to position the state at the forefront of U.S. global leadership in sustainable nuclear technology.

The location of the plant and a time line for construction and operation were not announced. FACNO is based in Richland, WA. The firm did not name any investors or other forms of financial backing.

Fast Reactor Breeder Design

According to the press statement, the energy park is designed to be the first to operate in a “closed-fuel cycle” meaning it will reprocess and reuse spent nuclear fuel on-site, eliminating 97% of long-lasting nuclear waste. The 240 MWe EAGL-1 reactor can also create more fuel than it burns, setting the stage for nuclear energy to be deemed not only clean, but renewable. The firm states on its website thatEAGL-1 operates in the fast neutron spectrum.

The firm did not provide technical details of what form the spent fuel would be in as received by the reactor. A reference to UO2 fuel on the firm’s website, intended to avoid the HALEU shortage, suggests the spent fuel would be derived from light water reactors. The claim that the reactor would produce more fuel than it burned indicates it is a “fast breeder” type reactor, as noted on the firm’s website, and that the fuel it would produce would be plutonium.

According to the World Nuclear Association, A 1,000 MWe light water reactor gives produces to about 25 tonnes of used fuel a year, containing up to 290 kilograms of plutonium. If the plutonium is extracted from used reactor fuel it can be used as a direct substitute for U-235, the PU-239 being the main fissile part.

Plutonium can be used in fast neutron reactors, where a much higher proportion of PU-239 fissions and in fact all the plutonium isotopes fission, and so function as a fuel. As with uranium, the energy potential of plutonium is more fully realized in a fast reactor.

Lead-Bismuth Coolant

FANCO’s flagship technology design, the EAGL-1 SMR, will use a liquid metal alloy called lead bismuth. The profile of FANCO founders on the company website indicate they have worked with sodium, molten salt, pressurized water, and high-temperature gas coolants for decades.

The team says in the press statement that the firm is convinced that lead bismuth solves the technical challenges to delivering safe, commercial-scale nuclear energy at an affordable price. The EAGL-1 design generates 240 MWe of electricity. The firm plans to offer the reactor in a “six-pack” cluster for total of 1,470 MW equivalent to an South Korean 1,400 MW PWR.

According to FANCO lead bismuth cooler “is a game-changer.” Due to the benign chemical properties of lead bismuth, EAGL-1 does not require complex safety systems using exotic materials. The EAGL-1 design will be manufactured and assembled in the U.S. TYhe firm did not indicate the site for the facotory not a timeline for its construction.

Economic Effects of the Project

“Indiana and First American Nuclear joining forces to improve the quality of life for Hoosiers and the American people was an easy decision to make,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources.

“FANCO has the ability to deliver affordable, sustainable power to light up our rooms, keep us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and rise to the ever-increasing energy demands of an advanced manufacturing and computing economy.”

In addition to tapping into Indiana’s existing workforce, First American Nuclear will develop a comprehensive program to attract and retain talent through partnerships with Indiana’s technical colleges and Universities, including tailored curricula, certifications, and apprenticeships. The program is expected to build a pipeline of highly skilled local workers to support the manufacturing and operations of EAGL-1 nuclear components, and the deployment of these systems across the U.S. and for export.

Purdue, BWXT Forge Strategic Collaboration To Advance Nuclear Innovation

Agreement establishes framework for joint research, technology development and student opportunities

Purdue University and BWX Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BWXT), a leading manufacturer and supplier of nuclear components and services for the commercial and government sectors, have signed a memorandum of understanding to forge a research relationship focused on next-generation nuclear manufacturing, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors.

Through collaborative research and innovation, this agreement advances technical abilities and knowledge regarding nuclear energy that is essential to addressing growing energy demand, the economic resilience of the country, national defense and global security.

Purdue President Mung Chiang and Suzy Sterner, BWXT senior vice president and chief corporate affairs officer, signed the agreement on 10/23/25 in Washington, D.C.

“This partnership marks a transformative moment for Purdue and the future of nuclear energy innovation,” Chiang said.

“By aligning our nationally recognized engineering programs with cutting-edge nuclear technologies, like small modular reactors, we’re not only advancing research — we’re also preparing the next generation of scientists, engineers and policy leaders to meet the energy and workforce demands of tomorrow.”

The agreement outlines academic opportunities to advance career development for Purdue students and the broader nuclear workforce through:

Separately, Purdue was awarded a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy in June 2024 to lead a consortium that will revitalize nuclear research facilities and expand university-led research for SMR and AR technologies. In May 2024, Purdue was selected by the state of Indiana to assess the feasibility of deploying SMRs in Indiana. Results of the study were announced in February 2025.

“This agreement between Purdue and BWXT further strengthens our state’s position as a leader in energy innovation and technology-driven economic growth,” said Jon Ford, executive director of the Indiana Office of Energy Development.

“With the growing footprint of a digital economy drawing upon the electric grid, partnerships like this are essential to ensuring we have the skilled workforce and advanced energy systems to support them.”

Constellation Plans to Double Capacity of Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant

(WNN) With energy demands forecast to increase sharply in the coming decades, Constellation said it “will explore building 2,000 MW of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.”

Most likely, this would involve two units in the range of 1,000 MW. The firm did not announce a timeline for these investments in new reactors nor specifics about their design or power ratings.

Calvert Cliffs is composed of two PWRs – one of 863 MW and the other 855 MW. The plans for the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center include 20-year life extensions for the nuclear two units which would otherwise shut down in 2034 and 2036.

Constellation also said it can invest in uprates to increase the two pressurised water reactors’ current 1,790 capacity by a further 190 MW. Calvert Cliffs is Maryland’s only nuclear power plant and produces about 40% of Maryland’s total power generation and 80% of the state’s clean power generation. The company says its combined plans could lead to the US state’s clean energy share increasing from 50% to 70%.

The company also announced it is considering development of an 800 MW battery storage project and 700 MW of gas-fired generation plant that could be switched to hydrogen fuel in the future,

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said: “Today, we announce an ambitious plan to make billions of dollars of new investments in Maryland without seeking any electricity rate increases, including options ranging from new natural gas to battery storage and nuclear energy.”

Terrestrial Energy, Westinghouse Sign Fuel Deal at Springfields, UK Plant

Agreement encompasses deconversion, fabrication, packaging, and transportation services for Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) fuel production, paving the way for pilot plant construction

Partnership with Westinghouse’s Springfield Fuels advances Terrestrial Energy’s Western supply chain strategy while accelerating IMSR commercialization pathway

Terrestrial Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:IMSR), a developer of small modular nuclear power plants using its Generation IV reactor technology, announced this week it has signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Company for the design and construction of an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) fuel pilot plant.

The agreement serves as a significant advancement of Terrestrial Energy’s fuel supply chain capabilities in support of the company’s accelerating commercialization pathway, with construction set to begin in 2026.

The agreement, building on a contract signed in August 2023 for the planning and initial design of IMSR fuel supply, leverages established deconversion and fuel manufacturing infrastructure at Westinghouse’s Springfields nuclear fuel manufacturing site in Preston, UK, to support Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR deployment strategy.

The expanded scope includes a wide range of commercial-scale fuel services, such as deconversion, fabrication, packaging and transportation. Upon completion of the pilot plant, the facility will be positioned to scale to commercial fuel production for a future fleet of IMSR Plants.

Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR plant uses next-generation molten salt reactor technology – a Generation IV nuclear technology – to deliver high-temperature thermal energy. This energy supports highly efficient steam turbine operation, low-cost electricity generation and direct thermal energy supply for industrial use.

Unique among North American Generation IV designs, the IMSR is fueled with low-cost, readily available Standard Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (SALEU) fuel, uranium enriched to under 5% uranium-235, allowing for alignment with Springfields role as a supplier of SALEU as uranium oxide fuel to commercial nuclear power reactors.

Terrestrial Energy’s use of low enriched uranium fuel, e.g., less than 5% U235, the only commercially available reactor fuel on the market today, for IMSR plant operation shields the firm from substantial supply challenges associated with the use of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium fuel (HALEU), which have been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and the current lack of commercial-scale supply in the U.S. market.

A key innovation in the pilot plant design is a re-optimized chemical process to supply UF4 deconverted from UF6 at 5% enrichment. Today’s industry standard is the deconversion of UF6 at 5% enrichment supplied from enrichment plants to uranium oxide fuel. The process to deconvert to UF4 is optimized with the pilot plant design enabling the large-scale fuel supply required for IMSR fleet deployment by leveraging Springfields’ existing commercial scale infrastructure.

Separatrely, Terrestrial Energy as the company is pursuing its first IMSR deployment at site in the U.S. including at Texas A&M’s RELLIS campus. Also, the company was selected for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, as well as the U.S. DOE Office of Nuclear Energy’s Fuel Line Pilot Program. Together, these programs provide a pathway to significantly accelerate Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR commercialization.

EDF Sets Goal of Producing 30 SMRs for Export by 2050

Reuters reports that state-owned French power utility EDF expects to complete the conceptual design of a small modular reactor (SMR) next year. The plan is to produce up to 30 SMRs according to a press statement by Julien Garrel, CEO of small modular reactor division Nuward.

While EDF did not provide details on the new design, it is assumed that it will based on light water reactors. EDF plans to offer the SMRs for export to provide power to energy intensive industries and data centers.

This is a reboot of an earlier effort that was shelved in July 2024 when EDF scrapped plans for a unique design approach. A source at Nuward told Reuters at the time the decision to go back to the drawing board on SMR development came after talks with prospective utility clients such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, the Czech Republic’s CEZ, and Finland’s Fortum, who are examining investments in both Generation III full-size nuclear plants and SMRs.

The key issues revolve around the cost of electricity that would be provided by the SMR based on its construction costs. The design at that time involved twin 170 MWe units attached to a single turbine.

The first prototype based on the new design is expected to be online in 2035, followed by one reactor annually until it has four in two countries. The new reactor is expected to offer customers 400 MWe of power and 115 MW of process heat. These numbers put it in the same general class as the Rollys-Royce 470 MW PWR which is being developed in the UK for both domestic and international customers.

Reuters reported that EDF said the costs and conceptual design are set to coincide with EDF’s final investment decision on its fleet of six large-scale EPR2 reactors for its home market, which the company plans to deliver by the second half of 2026.

Framatome to Produce TRISO Fuel in France for Advanced Reactors

Framatome announced the launch of new industrialization and development capabilities for TRISO fuel at its Romans-sur-Isère site in France. This initiative complements Framatome’s ongoing activities in the United States and marks a significant expansion of the company’s resources in France, with the installation of a pilot line dedicated to manufacturing various types of TRISO fuel for advanced reactor projects, including high-temperature reactors (HTR).

The new pilot line will focus on the production of TRISO (tristructural isotropic) fuel enriched up to 20%. This facility will enable the specification and qualification of TRISO fuel, as well as the associated manufacturing and quality control processes. The project is designed to pave the way for future industrialization of TRISO fuel in France.

Triso (TRi-structural ISOtropic) nuclear fuel is a highly robust, advanced fuel form for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. It consists of a uranium-based fuel kernel surrounded by three distinct layers of ceramic and carbon materials, which form an individual containment system for each particle.

This tri-structural design is said to provide exceptional resistance to corrosion, high temperatures, and irradiation, making it impossible to melt under extreme conditions and containing radioactive fission products effectively.

Nuclear Startup Blue Capsule in TRISO Fuel Deal With Framatome

(NucNet) France-based advanced nuclear reactor startup Blue Capsule Technology has announced an agreement to advance their cooperation on fuel with French company Framatome. The company said the term sheet agreement covers qualification of Triso fuel particles for Blue Capsule. It also includes manufacturing of fuel elements for the Blue Capsule high-temperature reactor.

Framatome has said it plans launch new industrialization and development capabilities for Triso fuel at its Romans-sur-Isère site in southern France.

“Blue Capsule’s high-temperature reactor (HTR) project has taken an important step forward with Framatome,” said the company’s president Edouard Hourcade. The firm notes its design has a heritage of work that took place in the 1960s

“Our HTR project is based on the idea that France, and Europe, with its world-class nuclear industry, needs a robust supply chain to best achieve its goal.”

The company said it aimed to deploy low-enriched Triso fuel at less than 5% in its reactors, citing the wide use of low-enriched uranium in the industry, and the export potential of reactors that use LEU.

Blue Capsule is targeting energy-intensive industries, given that its HTR will produce industrial-grade heat and steam, and electricity if needed.

Blue Capsule said these products are particularly suited for industry clusters and “inside-the-fence” industrial users such as the cement and alumina sectors, soda ash or steelmaking, or even synthetic fuel or hydrogen synthesis.

The company’s sodium-cooled plant is engineered to provide up to 150 MWth of heat at 700°C in the form of hot air, steam up to 650°C, or up to 50 MW of electricity.

China Announces Thorium-Uranium Conversion Breakthrough At Gobi Desert Experimental Reactor

(NucNet) An experimental reactor developed in the Gobi Desert by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics has achieved thorium-to-uranium fuel conversion. The achievement makes the 2 MW liquid-fuelled thorium-based molten salt reactor (TMSR) the only operating example of the technology in the world to have successfully loaded and used thorium fuel. The reactor, known as TMSR-LF1, came online in June 2024. It follows a sodium-cooled version – the TMSR-SF.

According to the academy, the experiment has provided initial proof of the technical feasibility of using thorium resources in molten salt reactor systems and represents a major leap forward for the technology.

According to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, quoting a report by Science and Technology Daily – the official newspaper of the Ministry of Science and Technology – it is the first time that scientists have been able to acquire experimental data on thorium operations from inside a molten salt reactor.

The Science and Technology Daily article, published on 11/01/25, was China’s first official confirmation of its success in the development of TMSR technology.

The TMSR-LF stream claims it is a full closed Th-U fuel cycle with breeding of U-233 and much better sustainability with thorium but greater technical difficulty. It is optimized for utilization of thorium with electrometallurgical pyroprocessing. The Fluorine design follows the sodium cooled design by about a decade. (January 2017 Gen IV Briefing – PDF file)

Some of the work on the TMSR series is based on collaboration between the Chinese Academy of Science’s (CAS) Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP) and the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) via a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to accelerate the development of fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactors (FHRs). This work took place in 2015-2016.

How the Process Works

At the heart of the breakthrough is a process known as in-core thorium-to-uranium conversion that transforms naturally occurring thorium-232 into uranium-233, which is a fissile isotope capable of sustaining nuclear chain reactions.

This transformation occurs through a precise sequence of nuclear reactions. The thorium-232 absorbs a neutron to become thorium-233, which decays into protactinium-233 and then further decays into the final product – a powerful nuclear fuel.

Critically, the entire process takes place inside the reactor core, eliminating the need for external fuel fabrication.

Thorium is dissolved in a fluoride salt into a high-temperature molten mixture which serves as both fuel and coolant. Neutrons from a small initial charge of fissile material, such as enriched uranium-235 or plutonium-239, initiate the chain reaction.

Throughout the operation, thorium-232 continuously captures neutrons and transforms into uranium-233, which then releases energy through nuclear fission to create a self-sustaining “burn while breeding” cycle – one of the technology’s defining advantages.

Thorium is much more abundant and accessible than uranium and has enormous energy potential. One mine tailings site in Inner Mongolia is estimated to hold enough of the element to power China entirely for more than 1,000 years, reports said.

Refuelling Can Be ‘On The Fly’

Unlike conventional pressurized water reactors, which must be shut down periodically to open the pressure vessel and replace solid fuel rods, the TMSR’s liquid fuel – a homogeneous mixture of fissile material dissolved in molten salt – circulates continuously, allowing for “on-the-fly” refuelling without interrupting operations.

Another advantage of the TMSR is that it requires no water at all, in sharp contrast to conventional nuclear power plants that are usually built near coastlines because of their massive cooling needs. This is a plus for a reactor located in the Gobi desert in the landlocked province of Gansu, in the north of the country near the Mongolian border.

Energy Department Seeks Proposals for AI Data Centers, Energy Projects at Paducah, KY

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management issued a Request for Offer on 11/04/25 seeking proposals from companies to build and power AI data centers on DOE’s Paducah site.

The Paducah site is one of four sites identified by the Department for AI infrastructure and generation projects on federal land. EM is now seeking proposals from U.S. companies to potentially enter into one or more long-term leasing agreements at the site that would be solely funded by the applicants.

DOE Assistant Secretary for the Office of Environmental Management Tim Walsh said, “Paducah has the resources and vision to support the next generation of AI infrastructure, creating new opportunities for prosperity while advancing national security for future generations.”

Applicants will be responsible for building, operating, and decommissioning each infrastructure project and must secure utility interconnection agreements. Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements.

DOE will post future dates for proposal submittal and a sponsored industry day event for applicants to learn more about the solicitation process and requirements outlined in the RFO, and tour the sites available for consideration. Check SAM.GOV for details.

About the Paducah Site

The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) was constructed in 1952 to produce enriched uranium, initially for the nation’s nuclear weapons program and later for nuclear fuel for commercial power plants. The plant is owned by the Department of Energy (DOE), which oversees environmental cleanup activities at the site, including environmental remediation, waste management, depleted uranium conversion, and decontamination and decommissioning.

Commercial enrichment was conducted under lease from 1993 until 2013 when operations ceased and the gaseous diffusion facilities were returned to the DOE Environmental Management (EM) program. EM has conducted extensive cleanup activities at the site since the late 1980s and is currently deactivating the returned plant facilities while continuing the aggressive remediation program being managed by its Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office.

The DRA’s assessment for Merrimack Station used a methodology different than the town’s and produced a vastly different value.","By GARRY RAYNO, Distant Dome

Anyone who travelled I-89 or I-93 in the winter months near the Capital City, would see a large white plume of smoke rising out of Merrimack Station, the coal-burning electric generating plant in Bow.

At one time, the plant produced a large percentage of the electricity used by Public Service of New Hampshire’s customers along with Seabrook Station.

In those days, the plant’s location along the Merrimack River was the prime reason Bow’s property taxes were much lower than surrounding communities.

While the plant required the town to have more fire fighting equipment, and more expensive ladder trucks than it needed for the rest of the town, the property taxes PSNH and in turn its customers paid, kept Bow’s tax rate among the lowest in the Capital region.

But as coal became a less acceptable fuel for generating electricity and heating homes and businesses due to its greenhouse gas emissions accelerating global warming and climate change, the plant ran less and less and for the past decade or so has been a “peaker,” only used when the electric demand is high and the usual less expensive sources of electricity cannot produce enough to satisfy the need.

In its last half dozen years, the plant ran at less than eight percent of its capacity compared to 70 and 80 percent 20 years ago.

The plant last ran in September and is now officially shut down by its owner Granite Shore Power, which intends to convert the facility into a renewable energy park with large battery storage.

The plant was scheduled to shut down in 2028 under an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency due to Clean Water Act violations from its cooling system

The plant also failed an emission test in recent years.

Merrimack Station was the last coal-fired generating plant in New England, and with its closure, coal emissions no longer fill New England skies to generate electricity.

The environmental benefits of moving away from coal are clear, but the slow reduction in use and now the closure are also examples of the complexities of the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund the vast majority of government in the state from Concord down to water precincts.

Several recent studies show what New Hampshire property owners already know, that the state’s property tax rates and collections are among the highest in the nation.

New Hampshire recently ranked fourth highest in the country for effective property tax rate behind only New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut.

New Hampshire property owners pay the third highest median property taxes.

And New Hampshire is number one in the nation in collecting state and local property taxes.

The foundation of property taxes is the assessment and how it is determined.

Property taxes are assessed on the value of the land you own and the value of the building or buildings.

No one would argue the value of Merrimack Station goes down with the move from full-time energy supplier to peaker, but how?

The value of the land hasn’t changed. Its potential for development along the shores of the Merrimack River probably increased with the plant’s shutdown.

And the buildings and their use have not changed and still have the capacity to produce lots of energy if ever the coal rail cars begin traveling to Bow again.

To see what can happen in this convoluted property tax system, you only have to look to the turn of the century when state lawmakers cobbled together an education funding plan that included a statewide education property tax and a state utility property tax. The plan was the legislature’s answer to the State Supreme Court’s Claremont decisions.

The state utility property tax was a direct hit on communities that hosted generating plants like Bow, Seabrook, Portsmouth and Newington.

While Portsmouth and Newington were able to survive the added expense because of the communities’ total property value, it transformed Bow and Seabrook from donor communities into receiver towns overnight.

At the time, the town of Bow had recently won a court case filed by PSNH objecting to the method the town used to assess Merrimack Station. It would later lose a similar case.

But when the state instituted its utility property tax, the Department of Revenue Administration decided what the assessments would be for poles, wires, transformers and yes the generating plants.

The DRA’s assessment for Merrimack Station used a methodology different than the town’s and produced a vastly different value.

With the two assessments tens of millions of dollars apart, PSNH threatened to sue the town unless it dropped its assessment down to the state’s.

A three-year step down agreement was reached to soften the blow to property taxpayers.

When the statewide property tax and the utility tax went into effect, the town of Bow lost multiple millions of dollars of its tax revenue to the state’s coffers.

Without making draconian cuts to schools or town services, those millions of now state dollars were downshifted to the local property taxpayers by the legislature’s actions.

I owned a home in Bow at the time and my property tax bill was a steady $1,500 a year.

In the next three years, my tax bill skyrocketed to over $6,000 a year and it kept going up as the value of Merrimack Station went down.

The town of Bow did not raise my property taxes 400 percent, the state of New Hampshire did as they did to every property owner in Bow, and most likely Seabrook as well. Portsmouth’s and Newington’s tax base softened the blow a little bit in those communities.

The value of my property did not change, if anything it went down because the community was no longer as desirable a place to live because the property taxes were no longer reasonable.

Just prior to this happening Bow had decided to build its own high school and leave Concord High School when the Concord School Board decided to increase Bow’s payments to attend the high school.

When the residents of Bow decided to build their own high school, they had no idea a few years later the state would manipulate the property tax system for its own benefit and drastically increase the property taxes for Bow residents and businesses.

A similar situation is developing with lawmakers messing around with local planning and zoning ordinances in the name of affordable housing after years of master plans being developed and approved, but now the state legislature knows best.

The same people who rail against the “state knows best” when it comes to civil rights or public education are leading the charge to loosen zoning and planning regulations.

There is a long history of the state changing the equation from school funding to the victims of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of state employers at the Sununu Youth Services Center or the governor’s take over of the sale of the former Laconia School property.

What does not change, is things never work to the advantage of communities negatively impacted by the state’s heavy hand on the scales.

The aim is simple, but lofty: for countries to work together to stop the worst effects of human-caused climate change.

That's a goal many experts say is slipping out of reach. But the stakes are high. Climate change is already escalating disasters that mean life or death for billions of people around the world, and delaying action will only worsen the problem.

Here's what you need to know about COP30.

A spotlight is on Indigenous peoples, forests and agriculture

With the world's largest rainforest on its doorstep, many have lauded Belem as well-positioned to highlight the role of Indigenous peoples and land stewardship in addressing climate change.

Although many past COPs have primarily focused on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, research has shown that shifting food systems is also a must. Countries also need to stop destroying the ecosystems that suck up pollution and protect humans from diseases.

The government of Brazil is spearheading a new initiative called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a program designed to give nations a monetary reward for protecting forests. It remains to be seen whether world leaders will pledge enough money to make the project a success.

Getting there — and staying there — has been a challenge for many

Before the conference, many would-be attendees worried about whether the city could host tens of thousands of people. Delegates have booked rooms on cruise ships in the harbor. Others are staying in by-the-hour “love motels,"" and some activists said they might camp out.

The weather is expected to be oppressively hot and humid, and as such the host country has already written to attendees to make the dress code a little more informal.

But some experts and locals say any discomfort is a much-needed reality check, especially for those coming from rich countries. The government of Brazil was adamant that the conference needed to be in Belem to showcase what's at stake: Poorer communities are often more vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change.

A decade since the historic Paris Agreement, countries are off course

Ten years ago, countries made a historic deal in the first global pact to fight climate change.

Since then, the planet’s annual temperature has already jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit), one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. The Paris Agreement was supposed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it's unlikely countries will stay below that threshold.

But the world has made some progress. Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. And if countries agree to do what they've said so far, they could stave off a little over a full degree Celsius warming. That may not sound like much, but every tenth of a degree matters when it comes to the effects on catastrophic weather.

This year, countries had homework: to show up with their updated national plans to fight climate change. The United States, one of the world's biggest polluters, won't be submitting theirs, having dropped out of the Paris Agreement. And many experts have criticized other countries' plans as too little to do what's needed.

No landmark deal is expected. Does that mean this is no big deal?

Unlike the Paris Agreement, or even last year when negotiators were trying to get countries to agree on how much rich countries should pay poor countries to adapt to climate change, this year's talks aren't expected to end with any ambitious new deal.

Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year's conference as the “implementation COP.”

“Those who go to Belem asking the question ‘what is the agreement that is going to come out of it?' are asking the wrong question,” said Christiana Figueres, former U.N. climate chief.

For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told The Associated Press that he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Many Lansing residents are concerned that the data center will raise electricity costs, generate noise pollution and drain the region’s water resources.
Lansing resident Aaron Guilbeau, who lives on the banks of Cayuga Lake close to the proposed site for TeraWulf’s data center, is worried about hearing the low hum of the data center from his home, and that the value of his property would drop as a result.
They have also flocked to public meetings about the moratorium to criticize TeraWulf and the data center industry.
But she lives six miles from the proposed data center, she said, and fears the data center will mean higher electricity rates.","Residents in an upstate New York community are trying to prevent construction of a planned data center by approving a year-long ban on large-scale development.

Data center company TeraWulf has signed an 80-year lease for 183 acres of a former coal-fired power plant, which sits on the banks of Cayuga Lake in Lansing, a town of 11,000 just north of Ithaca in New York’s Finger Lakes region.

Many Lansing residents are concerned that the data center will raise electricity costs, generate noise pollution and drain the region’s water resources.

The town board is scheduled to vote this month on a proposed moratorium that could derail TeraWulf’s plans.

According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, TeraWulf has the right to develop up to 400 megawatts of data center capacity there. In context, the center would be capable of sucking up around 16 percent of the total power capacity of the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station, the state’s largest power producer and the second-largest plant of its kind in the country.

Lansing resident Aaron Guilbeau, who lives on the banks of Cayuga Lake close to the proposed site for TeraWulf’s data center, is worried about hearing the low hum of the data center from his home, and that the value of his property would drop as a result.

Like many in Lansing, Guilbeau believes that the center will affect his quality of life and utility bills. He is not alone. Hundreds of residents have submitted public comments, many of which raise possible issues with water use and noise. They have also flocked to public meetings about the moratorium to criticize TeraWulf and the data center industry.

Union members and some business leaders, however, support the data center, excited about the prospect of new construction and maintenance jobs the site could bring to the area.

“These are good jobs,” said David Emmi, the vice president of O’Connell Electric, an electrical contractor based out of upstate New York, at a town board meeting in September. “It really is a great thing for the community.”

But residents’ reservations are not unfounded. Data centers often need significant amounts of water to cool their computers—for some, that means hundreds of thousands of gallons.

In a letter to the town board, TeraWulf said that it will not rely on Cayuga Lake to cool its computers. In an email statement, a TeraWulf spokesperson said that the facility will use “a fully closed-loop cooling system” that circulates water and a food additive called propylene glycol to cool the data center computers. The heat from the data center is transferred to a secondary water loop, which is cooled by large fans.

During the site’s operations, the spokesperson wrote, “the system is sealed, it does not consume or discharge water.” The coolant can remain in the system for seven to fifteen years, according to the spokesperson, without requiring replacement or recharge.

At an event organized by TeraWulf to engage residents, Sean Farrell, the company’s chief operating officer, touted the system’s benefits. Farrell also told residents that to cool a 50-megawatt building, TeraWulf would use around 250,000 to 300,000 gallons on the first day of operations.

After that, water would only be needed for “periodic maintenance or negligible replenishment due to evaporation within the sealed system” a spokesperson said.

Many data centers cool their computers by running water through a system and then dump it back out at elevated temperatures, with some water lost due to evaporation. A dry cooling system like Terawulf’s, which uses air to keep temperatures low, requires much less water than other cooling systems, because it recycles water and very little evaporates, according to the European Climate Adaptation Platform.

But this type of cooling can require significant energy to keep the fans running, according to the Energy Information Administration which examined the use of these systems in power plants. The system may also struggle to reject heat during warm weather because the difference between the outside temperature and the computer heat is minor.

Data centers are also known to emit a near-constant low-frequency hum that neighbors often hear. Farrell said the company has chosen “ultra-low noise” coolers for the site that are designed to operate at a lower decibel level than traditional systems.

TeraWulf operates a cryptocurrency mining center facility in Somerset, New York, where residents have long complained about the noise. In response to these criticisms, Farrell said the company has “implemented noise reduction solutions” and has conducted tests showing that noise from the facility does not reach these residents’ property.

On its website, TeraWulf says it operates “state-of-the-art infrastructure that fuses advanced computing technologies with sustainable energy.” At his company’s event, Farrell discussed the “abundant zero-carbon power” in the region, suggesting that the data center will be powered primarily by renewable energy.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has said that upstate New York’s power mix is “approaching 90 percent emission‐free.” But there is no way to know where the power for TeraWulf’s proposed new data center would be coming from because it is connected to the state grid, not an individual power source, a spokesperson for the state’s grid operator said.

Kristin Maushart, who has lived in Lansing for 11 years, had never attended a town board meeting before. But she lives six miles from the proposed data center, she said, and fears the data center will mean higher electricity rates. So on Sept. 24, she made her way to a meeting.

“When I got there, the line was literally out the door,” she said. “I had to wait an hour, actually, to get into the room.”

Because data centers consume so much electricity, utilities may have to upgrade power lines or other grid infrastructure to supply more power to these sites. Even if the centers pay for connection to the grid, as they do in New York, there may also eventually be infrastructure upgrades needed in other areas of the state’s grid—and the cost of that is often passed on to ratepayers.

Additionally, rising demand for electricity can also cause an increase in prices. A recent blog post by the New York Independent System Operator, which operates New York’s grid, said that “electrification and data center growth drives up prices and prompts calls for accelerated investment in new resources.”

The operator also said that the state could face reliability issues as early as next year due, in part, to the additional demand from data centers.

One report from the state grid operator predicted that, by 2030, electricity demand could increase by an additional 1,600 megawatts to nearly 4,000 megawatts because of large power drains such as data centers and building electrification across the state.

The TeraWulf spokesperson said that the data center at Cayuga Lake will curtail power use during peak demand to help stabilize the grid. The company expects to “invest approximately $15 million in local electrical infrastructure upgrades to enable safe interconnection and strengthen grid reliability for the first 138 [megawatts].”

Ultimately, many Lansing residents are not convinced that this will be a boon for their town.

“I don’t believe that they are a partner of our community,” said Maushart. “I think it’s a mega-corporation—I think they’re here to extract resources from us. … They represent their best interests, which are their stakeholders and their customers.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2207733302-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 21:19:17.157858

Nov 7 (Reuters) – The Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday it approved 14 requests from small refineries for full or partial exemptions to the nation’s biofuel blending mandates, drawing criticism from a top U.S. biofuel trade group.

The decisions effectively clear the remainder of the agency’s huge backlog of such requests that had built up under former President Joe Biden’sadministration. The EPA had approved 140 petitions in part or in full earlier this year, and denied just 28, leaving just a handful from previous years remaining under review.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel pool each year. But small refiners can seek exemptions if they show the obligations would cause them significant financial hardship.

The waivers have been a lightning rod of contention between oil refiners who want to avoid costly blending obligations and biofuel advocates concerned that they eat into their market.

Under Friday’s decision, two applications were granted 100% exemptions, and 12 were granted 50% exemptions.

The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuel industry trade group, criticized the waivers as harmful to farmers.

“Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,” RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.

The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share.
Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.
Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.
The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance.","Rivian’s board has approved a new compensation package for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade — a move that mirrors Tesla’s headline-grabbing $1 trillion pay plan for Elon Musk.

The decision underscores how Musk’s compensation structure has become a model for high-growth companies seeking to tie executive rewards to ambitious performance targets and shareholder value creation.

Rivian said the plan aims to retain its founder while keeping him focused on profitability and expansion as the company prepares to roll out its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 is expected to compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y, one of the world’s best-selling electric crossovers.

The company’s decision comes amid broader financial pressure on electric vehicle makers. Rivian has struggled with slowing sales following the removal of key U.S. EV tax credits and has recently laid off about 600 workers — roughly 4.5% of its workforce — to reduce costs.

According to Reuters, the new incentive plan replaces a previous one that Rivian’s board said was unlikely to be met under current market conditions.

Under the revised plan, Scaringe will receive options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian’s Class A stock at an exercise price of $15.22 each — the same as Thursday’s closing price. The award will vest if the company meets stock price milestones ranging from $40 to $140 per share over 10 years, alongside new operating income and cash flow goals over seven years. The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share. Rivian canceled that deal after concluding the targets were unrealistic.

At full vesting, the new package represents about 3% of Rivian’s shares. Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.

“RJ’s starting position makes this package much more reasonable than Musk’s,” said Vitaly Golomb, managing partner at Mavka Capital and a Rivian investor.

Tesla’s board has argued that Musk’s massive $1 trillion package, approved last week after months of controversy, was essential to keep him focused on driving the company’s value toward an $8 trillion valuation. Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.

“While Rivian may not be a direct copycat, there are definitely Elon Musk characteristics that are similar,” said Yonat Assayag, a partner at ClearBridge Compensation Group. “It’s not to keep up with Musk, but inspired by Musk’s award.”

Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value if the company hits all the milestones as part of the package, while Reuters’ calculation showed that Scaringe will get up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options.

However, not everyone is convinced that such ambitious pay designs will pay off. Amit Batish, director at research firm Equilar, noted that “while these packages sound attractive, they don’t always work out. Many CEOs struggle to hit the targets due to changing policies and economic headwinds.”

In addition to the stock-based incentives, Rivian’s board has doubled Scaringe’s base salary to $2 million, aligning his compensation more closely with shareholder returns. The automaker said the revised structure was crafted with input from an independent consultant.

Rivian also announced that Scaringe will chair the board of Mind Robotics, a new spinoff backed by external investors to develop industrial AI systems. The CEO has been granted 1 million common units in the venture, representing up to a 10% stake once profitability thresholds are met.

The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance. But as the EV industry faces intensifying competition, high borrowing costs, and uncertain demand, analysts say it will test whether tying billion-dollar compensation to future milestones can truly motivate sustainable growth — or simply replicate the high-risk model that made Tesla’s rise so polarizing.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amazon-Rivian.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:19:14.079022

The two-year tipping point where EVs beat gas cars

Researchers at Duke University decided to crunch the numbers properly.

They looked at how much pollution comes from making, fueling, and driving both gas and electric cars over time.

And while gas cars might look cleaner to start with, they fall behind fast.

Because after two years of driving, an EV’s total emissions drop below those of a gas car doing the same miles.

At first, electric cars start about 30 percent worse because of how their batteries are made.

But once you’re driving, they clean up their act quickly.

The team used a big global model (basically a super calculator for climate data) to check how things play out through to 2050, and the results are clear.

By 2030, every extra bit of battery power could stop nearly 500 pounds of carbon from entering the atmosphere.

And over a car’s full lifetime, the air-pollution damage from gas cars is up to three times worse.

The race toward cleaner miles

Now, this study didn’t count everything, like what happens when you scrap a car or build chargers, but it still shows where things are heading.

EVs are improving faster than anyone expected, and cleaner electricity means they’ll pay off even quicker.

Brands like Toyota and Volvo are already building next-gen batteries and charging perks to push that timeline down even further.

So, while gas cars puff away like it’s still 1999, the EVs are catching up.

And lapping them by year two.

Driving electric isn’t just trendy, it’s cleaner, cheaper, and officially ahead in the race to zero.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/gas-or-electric.webp,N,,2025-11-08 18:58:52.876116

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Duke Energy reported Q3 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.81, representing a 13% increase from $1.60 in the same period last year. Year-to-date adjusted EPS reached $4.81, up 15% from $4.17 in 2024. The company’s Electric Utilities & Infrastructure segment was the primary driver of growth, contributing an additional $0.24 per share compared to the prior year quarter.

The following slide details the Q3 2025 adjusted EPS performance and key drivers:

Weather had a modest negative impact of $0.02 per share during the quarter, with total weather effects for Q3 2025 amounting to $39 million pretax. Despite this headwind, rate cases, riders, and increased volumes supported the strong quarterly performance.

Strategic Capital Expansion

A centerpiece of Duke Energy’s presentation was its expanded capital investment plan. The company expects to announce a $95 billion capital plan for 2026-2030, with an additional $10 billion in potential upside opportunities. This represents a significant increase from the current $87 billion plan for 2025-2029 and is projected to drive earnings base growth from approximately 8% to 8.5%+.

The expanded capital plan focuses on customer value and affordability through various strategies, including fleet investments, AI utilization, and tax credit leveraging:

To meet growing demand, Duke Energy is advancing more than 8.5 GW of new dispatchable generation across its service territories. The company has secured critical agreements to support this build-out, including 19 gas turbines through a partnership agreement and EPC contracts for multiple combined cycle facilities:

Load Growth and Customer Acquisition

Duke Energy highlighted accelerating load growth as a key driver of its expansion plans. Enterprise-wide load growth is expected to increase from 1.5-2% in 2026 to 3-4% in 2027-2029, with even stronger growth projected in the Carolinas (4-5% in 2027-2029).

This growth is supported by approximately 3 GW of recently signed data center agreements and electric service agreements (ESAs) with major companies including Amazon, BMW Group, Digital Realty, and Novo Nordisk:

The company emphasized that its contract structures for large loads include provisions to protect existing customers, such as minimum billing demands, credit support requirements, interruptibility provisions, and termination damages.

Financial Strength and Investor Value

Duke Energy’s presentation outlined its balance sheet strength and positioning for growth. The company is on target to achieve 14%+ FFO/Debt by the end of 2025 and is targeting 15% FFO/Debt over the long term. It has also made progress on storm cost recovery, with approximately $1 billion of North Carolina bonds issued and $600 million of South Carolina bonds expected:

For investors, Duke Energy presented an attractive value proposition combining a 3.4% dividend yield with long-term dividend growth and an attractive risk-adjusted total shareholder return of approximately 10%:

Regulatory Updates and Recovery Mechanisms

The company provided details on its regulatory activities across multiple jurisdictions, including rate cases in the Carolinas, Kentucky, and other states. These regulatory proceedings are critical to supporting Duke Energy’s capital recovery and growth plans:

Duke Energy emphasized that the vast majority of its electric capital investments are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms, which helps mitigate regulatory lag. These mechanisms include multi-year rate plans, riders, forecasted test years, and formula rate contracts:

Forward-Looking Guidance

Duke Energy narrowed its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.25-$6.35 and reaffirmed its long-term growth rate of 5-7% through 2029. The company expressed confidence in achieving results in the top half of this range beginning in 2028, based on the midpoint of the 2025 guidance ($6.30).

Key drivers for 2026 earnings include North Carolina and Florida multi-year rate plans, Indiana rate case outcomes, South Carolina rate cases, and continued customer growth and economic development. The company also highlighted structural tailwinds from population migration and economic development as supporting long-term earnings growth.

In the Carolinas, Duke Energy filed its integrated resource plan in October 2025, emphasizing reliability and affordability while supporting an ""all of the above"" resource mix including natural gas, battery storage, and solar. The plan maintains optionality for new nuclear to be online by 2037 and projects a customer bill impact CAGR of 2.1% over the next decade.

Conclusion

Duke Energy’s Q3 2025 presentation showcased strong financial performance with adjusted EPS of $1.81, up 13% year-over-year. The company’s strategic focus on expanding its capital investment plan to $95-105 billion for 2026-2030 positions it to capitalize on accelerating load growth from data centers and manufacturing customers.

While the stock experienced a slight pre-market decline despite the earnings beat, Duke Energy’s long-term outlook remains positive, supported by constructive regulatory environments, modern recovery mechanisms, and structural growth drivers in its service territories. The company’s balanced approach to reliability, affordability, and shareholder returns provides a foundation for its projected 5-7% long-term EPS growth through 2029.

For the first time in 30 years, the United States was not in the room. The U.S. is expected to be absent again in two days, when the rest of the world resumes those discussions at COP30.

It will not participate because America is no longer a party to the Paris Climate Agreement, thanks to President Donald Trump.

That’s not to say the United States is not involved. Although government science programs have been shuttered and Trump has banned the use of the word “climate,” American scientists are still working on solutions. However, America remains the world’s second-largest source of carbon pollution, and it is led by a president determined to make the U.S. an outlier, an outlaw, and a free rider in the global climate movement.

The question is whether other countries will let President Trump get away with it.

America’s official position – Trump’s policies to increase fossil-fuel production, suppress clean energy technologies, and abandon carbon-cutting goals – is at least as harmful domestically as it is internationally. President Trump is actively shutting down clean energy investments, including a wind-energy project that had already broken ground.

The Trump administration’s opposition to a wind energy project off the coast of Maryland has put its sponsor, US Wind, at risk of bankruptcy. Sponsors of a wind farm off the Massachusetts coast say they will not proceed because Trump’s policies have left them with “no viable path.”

In September alone, clean energy manufacturers cancelled construction of four new plants totaling $1.6 billion in investments. General Motors has stopped production of an electric van because Trump prevailed on the U.S. Congress to eliminate EV tax credits.

Although solar and wind power are cheaper than electricity generated by fossil fuels, Trump’s policies leave the U.S. electric system dangerously dependent on the economic volatility and pollution of natural gas and coal. Natural gas is widely touted as a “transition fuel,” but its price in the United States has gone up to the point that electric utilities are turning back to coal.

Last year, before Trump took office, clean energy jobs grew three times faster than the rest of America’s workforce, providing economic momentum. Now, companies have canceled more than $22 billion in clean energy manufacturing capacity, leading to significant job losses and missed opportunities for U.S. economic growth. One estimate is that a federal budget Trump pushed through Congress in July could cost the United States more than 830,000 jobs in the next five years, signifying a major economic setback.

Trump’s carbon-intensive energy policies may put U.S. businesses at a disadvantage in international markets. The EU plans to tax carbon-intensive imports starting next year; the UK plans the same in 2027. Other nations could follow. Companies that continue exporting carbon-intensive products will lose market share, and their American employees will lose jobs.

Nevertheless, Trump continues branding climate change as a hoax and a scam.

Why do his policies make America an international outlaw? A new study by the University of Washington estimates that Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris pact will raise the planet’s temperature by an additional 0.1 percent, assuming all other countries meet their goals. That doesn’t sound like much, but it means the chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees, the upper limit set in Paris, will decrease from 34 percent to 27 percent. The study’s lead author, Prof. Adrian Raftery, says this is the most optimistic calculation of Trump’s impact.

Trump has used the threat of trade tariffs to extort the European Union and other nations into buying U.S. oil and gas, despite their own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The administration, joined by Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, just blocked a proposed global tax on carbon pollution from shipping, a policy developed over 10 years.

In short, Trump has turned America from a global leader on mitigating climate change to a “go-it-alone pariah.”

However, the United States remains a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that signatory nations are obligated to cooperate in combating climate change. Even if the United States tried to withdraw from the UNFCCC, the ICJ cited other international treaties that require countries to “fulfill their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence,” especially in situations such as global warming, where the climate system is a “resource shared by all states.”

In the ICJ’s opinion, countries failing to meet their environmental obligations are liable for paying damages and reparations. Although no country has sued the United States yet, Trump’s reckless and renegade energy policies may make it only a matter of time.

Yet, while the United States complicates the world’s ability to stabilize the climate, it is not the only problem. Efforts to hold global warming to well below 2°C are lacking in many other nations, as is progress on most of the world’s other 3,000 multilateral environmental agreements, including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition, scientists convened by the Stockholm Resilience Institute, who defined nine critical planetary boundaries in 2009, say we have now crossed into dangerous territory for seven. Analysts say the barriers to international collaboration on environmental agreements include a lack of political will, limited resources, weak enforcement mechanisms, fragmented governance, and disagreements over who is responsible for ecological damages and threats. However, these problems are not unsolvable.

Trump’s international bullying raises the question of what else he may be doing to subvert the world’s timely transition to clean energy. It is worrying that three other countries joined the U.S. to stall the tax on carbon pollution from shipping. All countries must hold fast to the Paris Agreement. The United States will be back.

As for COP30, the best outcome would be for the remaining 195 countries in the Paris pact to demonstrate how nations can navigate the barriers to fulfill the visions of two of our great departed naturalists.

With over 290 licensed enterprises already operating, these zones now face a defining moment as global supply chains demand greener industrial credentials before committing capital.

Two major solar projects signal this shift: the 200 megawatt peak (MWp) solar development at the Dawa Industrial Zone by Solar For Industries Limited, and the 16.82MWp rooftop solar installation within the Tema Export Processing Zone by Helios Solar Energy. President John Dramani Mahama broke ground for the Dawa solar park on November 6, naming it the Norbert Anku Solar Park. The facility will eventually expand to 1,000MWp by 2032.

The Tema project, commissioned in July 2024, became Africa’s largest single rooftop solar installation, covering 95,754 square metres atop the International Warehousing Company Mega Warehouse. The International Finance Corporation provided $30 million in financing for clean power and water infrastructure, expecting the solar plant to cut Ghana’s emissions by approximately 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.

Renewable energy has moved beyond being an optional feature for industrial parks. It’s now a prerequisite for competitiveness, particularly as manufacturing firms face mounting pressure to reduce carbon footprints and comply with international trade standards. Power reliability challenges in sub-Saharan Africa force businesses to shoulder significant costs, with energy expenses eating into operating margins and deterring foreign investment.

The next generation of Special Economic Zones will need sustainability and innovation baked into their core design. This matches the global pattern where investors increasingly require proof of environmental performance before committing funds. The commercial logic proves compelling: companies operating in renewable-powered zones can slash operating costs, meet international carbon standards, and tap into climate finance instruments that weren’t available to conventional industrial parks.

Ghana’s Free Zones and future SEZs could become testing grounds for green bond backed industrial finance, offering companies reduced borrowing costs when they adopt clean energy and resource efficiency upgrades. This creates opportunities not just for large foreign firms but also for local suppliers who can integrate into these greener value chains.

The government’s role centers on bridging the financing gap through targeted tax incentives, blended finance partnerships, and transparent sustainability metrics. Investors commit capital when they see that green SEZs deliver profits, not just compliance. High capital costs for renewable infrastructure and limited concessional financing remain obstacles that require coordinated policy responses.

The Dawa solar project will supply power to the Enclave Power Company network serving industrial clients rather than Ghana’s national grid. Industries within the Dawa Industrial Enclave will receive a 10 percent discount on power sourced from the solar park, according to Kojo Aduhene, Chief Executive Officer of Quarm Investments.

President Mahama emphasized that solar powered industrial parks help protect Ghanaian jobs, maintain market access, and position the country’s industries to compete under the African Continental Free Trade Area and other trade agreements. He noted that Ghana’s industries must stay competitive under new global regulations, including the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which will penalize exports from countries with high carbon footprints.

For local businesses, the opportunity lies in becoming suppliers to global firms operating within these zones. This represents a critical pathway toward inclusive growth, allowing Ghanaian enterprises to participate in international value chains while meeting stringent environmental standards.

The global race for sustainable manufacturing has begun. Countries that successfully integrate clean energy into their industrial zones will attract investment flows that bypass traditional fossil fuel dependent locations. Ghana possesses the natural resources, policy frameworks, and geographic advantages to capture a meaningful share of these green value chains.

Under Ghana’s National Renewable Energy Master Plan, the government has set a target to achieve at least 15 percent renewable energy share by 2030. Solar projects like those at Dawa and Tema advance this goal while aligning Ghana with the global clean energy transition.

The potential remains significant, but realizing it demands bold and coordinated policy action. Ghana’s Free Zones and SEZs could deliver more than export revenues. They could fundamentally redefine the country’s growth model, making it cleaner, more competitive, and more sustainable. Success requires moving beyond incremental changes toward integrated strategies that treat renewable energy, water management, and industrial development as interconnected priorities rather than separate initiatives.

If executed effectively, Ghana’s approach to green industrial zones could serve as a model for other African nations seeking to balance economic development with environmental sustainability. The window for action is narrowing as global investors increasingly allocate capital based on climate performance and long term sustainability rather than short term cost advantages alone.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-11-08 15:19:26.531596

Mark Carney’s first budget as Finance Minister quietly provided Canada with the ingredients for something the country has lacked for a century: a truly national electricity backbone. The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a 15% refundable credit on new generation, storage, and the transmission of electricity between provinces and territories, looks like a simple fiscal tool. It is not. It is the seed of a connected, modern grid that could knit together the regional islands of Canadian electricity into a single low-carbon engine for the electrified economy ahead. And it’s far from the only lever that can be pulled to drive Canada’s second Golden Spike, this one delivering clean electrons sea-to-sea, not freight and passengers on gleaming rails.

Canada’s electricity system was built for another era. The provinces each developed their own grids to serve their local industries and populations, often connecting south to American markets but rarely to one another. Québec built high-voltage DC lines to New England. Manitoba strung its Bipoles to the U.S. Midwest. Alberta and British Columbia tied into the Western Interconnection, while the Maritimes remained isolated on small synchronous systems. The result is a federation of grids with minimal east-west connection. Canada’s three asynchronous regions—Western, Eastern, and Québec—still cannot freely share significant terawatt-hours of energy.

That separation matters more every year. Electrification is expanding into everything from transport and heat to new industrial processes. Data centers, electrified steel mills and electrified ports demand new capacity. Decarbonization targets and climate resilience call for moving vast amounts of clean power across the country. Yet the most wind and hydro potential sits far from the greatest demand.

Hydropower gives Canada a built-in advantage that few nations possess. Reservoir systems across Québec, Manitoba, and British Columbia act as vast passive batteries, capable of ramping output up or down in seconds to balance intermittent generation. Linking those provinces through HVDC corridors would allow the country to use that flexibility at a continental scale. Solar output peaks later in the West, where Alberta and Saskatchewan can overgenerate in the afternoon and push surplus electrons eastward as Ontario and Québec approach evening demand. Wind follows its own rhythm: prairie winds often rise when Atlantic and Pacific systems calm, and offshore gusts in Newfoundland and Labrador frequently complement interior lulls. With interprovincial transmission spanning multiple time zones, Canada could level production and demand across thousands of kilometers, turning variability into stability and making clean electricity as dispatchable as the fossil power it replaces.

The 2025 budget reframed the federal role in fixing that problem. It made transmission projects eligible for the clean electricity credit and removed restrictions that previously kept provincial Crown corporations—the real builders of Canadian power lines—from using it. It also aligned the Canada Infrastructure Bank and the Canada Growth Fund as partners, making it easier to combine low-cost federal financing with utility capital and Indigenous equity. The message was clear: the federal government will help carry the risk of nation-scale grid investments.

On paper, Canada already has the beginnings of a cross-country network. The new Wasoqonatl Reliability Intertie between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick will add a 345 kV AC double-circuit line spanning roughly 160 kilometres, supported by $217 million in Infrastructure Bank equity and slated for construction later this decade. British Columbia and Alberta have a legislated plan to restore nearly one gigawatt of transfer capacity on their 500 kV AC intertie by 2026, reversing years of constraint caused by aging equipment and operational limits. Alberta and Saskatchewan are replacing and uprating shared 230 kV AC transmission assets to improve cross-border flows and strengthen reliability across the Prairie seam. Ontario and Québec are examining expansion of their 315 kV and 500 kV AC interties, with options for ±320 kV HVDC back-to-back converters to manage asynchronous operation and trade. Manitoba, meanwhile, is assessing replacement of end-of-life 500 kV transformers and control systems at its eastern boundary, where integration with Ontario could eventually involve new ±500 kV HVDC converters. None of these are megaprojects yet, but together they are the structural anchors of a future national HVDC backbone.

The real opportunity is to connect these regional projects into an east-west HVDC overlay that carries controllable, low-loss power flows between regions. Modern voltage-source HVDC technology can operate as multi-terminal systems rather than simple point-to-point lines. That means each provincial node can be built as a discrete project and later interconnected into a national mesh. The technical foundations already exist. Labrador’s Muskrat Falls line and the Maritime Link are both HVDC systems. Manitoba’s Bipole III, at 500 kV, is one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Québec’s export grid to the U.S. is built on similar technology. Extending this expertise to interprovincial corridors is not a leap of imagination but an engineering progression.

In a phased plan, the Atlantic HVDC assets would connect through New Brunswick into Québec. The central corridor would link Manitoba and Ontario through upgraded interties and new converter stations. The western seam between Alberta and Saskatchewan would become the HVDC bridge between the Western and Eastern Interconnections. Each region would continue to operate its own AC system, while the HVDC overlay would transfer surplus generation and stabilize supply during peaks or outages. By 2035, the regional patches could be joined into a multi-terminal DC grid capable of balancing renewable generation across the country in real time.

The proposed North Atlantic Transmission One–Link, or NATO-L, is an ambitious trans-Atlantic HVDC project that would connect Eastern Canada with Ireland or the United Kingdom through roughly 6 GW of subsea transmission capacity. My involvement has been peripheral, focused on early-stage assessment of hydroelectric balancing potential between the continents and on reviewing initial collateral from the project’s technical and financial teams. NATO-L represents a strong enhancement of the value proposition for both sides of the Atlantic. With a cross-Canada HVDC spine in place, the country’s hydro, wind, and solar assets could feed into a unified grid capable of supporting Europe during periods of low renewable output, while importing power when domestic conditions tighten. Canada and Europe, long-standing allies in security and trade, could extend that partnership into the energy domain, sharing clean electrons across the ocean as readily as they now share commitments to stability and decarbonization.

The economics are compelling. Transmission accounts for a modest fraction of total system costs but delivers reliability and curtailment savings that compound over decades. Studies of interprovincial grid expansion show potential net benefits in the tens of billions by 2050 from avoided fossil generation and improved utilization of hydro and wind. The tax credit reduces the weighted average cost of capital by cutting effective project costs up to 15%, improving the internal rate of return for provincial utilities and Indigenous partners. With the Infrastructure Bank and Growth Fund offering low-interest capital and equity participation, the public risk is contained while long-term national benefits are captured.

What remains is coordination. Canada has no national transmission authority. Planning, permitting, and cost allocation sit within provincial jurisdiction, and environmental reviews can stretch for years. Building an HVDC overlay requires a formal framework similar to Australia’s integrated system plan or the U.S. Department of Energy’s designated transmission corridors. A National Transmission Accord, endorsed by provinces, utilities, and Indigenous governments, could establish shared standards for HVDC design, set interconnection rules, and coordinate permitting. It would not federalize electricity but harmonize it.

In May of 2024, 28 energy ministers in Europe agreed that it was essential to build a European transmission system, not a country-by-country system, and this year started the process of creating a European transmission planning organization. I had a small part in that, having edited the second edition of Supergrid Super Solution, Eddie O’Connor and Kevin O’Sullivan’s handbook for a European HVDC mesh supergrid, a book that’s on every European energy ministers’ desk, sharing a stage in Brussels in October at its launch with one of the energy ministers and a member of European parliament, among others, to discuss it, and helping strategize and launch Supergrid Europe, a new Brussels-based NGO devoted to advocating for the supergrid. Europe, while it’s moving too slowly, is moving. Canada needs to recognize that this is the direction of the world and move rapidly to keep up.

My Sankey energy flows vision of an electrified Canadian economy shows the payoff. Fossil fuels feeding into transportation, heating, and industry shrink to zero, while electricity, ambient heat and biomass flows expand to replace them. Hydro, wind and solar dominate the primary energy input, converging into a continental-scale grid that distributes power efficiently from coast to coast. On the right side of the diagram, energy services—mobility, heating, and industrial production—consume electricity directly. Rejected energy, the losses inherent in combustion, nearly disappears, dropping from two-thirds of all primary energy in today’s economy to a fifth in a decarbonized future.

This vision of an electrified and efficient electrostate isn’t a fantasy. China is building it incredibly rapidly today, shooting past the west in the electrification of industry and transportation and the deployment of renewables, with massive transmission corridors linking hydro, wind and solar megascale complexes in the west and northwest to demand centers in the south east. Sub-Saharan Africa is leapfrogging the west, with solar deployments shooting up in the last year, and studies for 10,000 km HVDC interconnectors linking a dozen countries the breadth and length of the continent. Pakistan deployed 17 GW of solar, cheap Chinese panels on rooftops without subsidies, often with cheap Chinese batteries buffering them, in 2024 alone, has reconductored 80% of its existing transmission lines, and has built massive north-south HVDC interconnections with China’s help. India is hammering in wind and solar and built out its HVDC transmission in advance of solar deployments to avoid curtailment.

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit isn’t the only budget element that can support this. Carney’s budget contains several other levers that can help Canada finance and coordinate a national HVDC backbone without inventing new institutions or programs. The most direct is the expansion of the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s statutory capital from $35 billion to $45 billion, paired with a broader mandate to invest in nation-building projects of any asset class. That opens the door for the Bank to take on equity or blended-financing roles in transmission corridors that cross provincial lines. The Bank already has a track record with the Wasoqonatl Reliability Intertie and other clean power projects. Giving it both capital and flexibility allows it to anchor the kind of multi-jurisdictional partnerships that HVDC lines require, combining federal patient capital with provincial and Indigenous investment.

The Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit adds another piece to the puzzle. It provides a 30% refundable credit on the cost of manufacturing equipment used to produce key clean-energy components, from batteries and solar panels to electrical transformers, converters, and high-voltage cables. For a national HVDC program, this credit can underwrite the industrial base that builds the physical backbone. Every converter station and transmission corridor depends on specialized, capital-intensive manufacturing of switchgear, rectifiers, and advanced power electronics. Locating that production inside Canada not only captures economic value but also shields the grid build from supply-chain volatility and import delays. If provinces or private manufacturers align their investments with this credit, Canada could anchor its own HVDC equipment production and feed a decades-long cycle of domestic infrastructure demand.

Canada already builds much of the equipment a national HVDC system would need. Hitachi Energy’s Varennes plant in Québec manufactures large HVDC transformers and converter components, supported by a new federal investment to expand production and simulation facilities. Domestic firms such as Northern Transformer in Ontario and PTI Transformers in Saskatchewan already produce high-voltage transformers for utilities across North America. This existing industrial and technical base gives Canada a running start toward scaling up the specialized manufacturing an HVDC backbone requires. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit wouldn’t be starting from a clean slate, but expanding on expertise and manufacturing we already have. It’s worth pointing out that Canada’s transformers and the steel and aluminum that are used to manufacture them are hit by Trump’s tariffs, so expanding our domestic market as well as seeking other markets is rational economic policy.

A new Major Projects Office is also being funded with over $200 million across five years to coordinate approvals, financing, and Indigenous participation for nationally significant infrastructure. Transmission lines suffer more from procedural drag than from lack of money. Each province has its own regulatory and consultation regime, and interprovincial lines often need federal environmental assessments as well. An office that can unify reviews, coordinate Indigenous engagement, and streamline permitting is more valuable to an HVDC build than another tranche of cash. Without institutional coordination, no amount of funding will move electrons across provincial borders.

The Build Communities Strong Fund, worth about $51 billion over ten years, offers another entry point. Most of its streams target local and community infrastructure, but its “direct delivery” arm explicitly supports regionally significant projects. HVDC lines do not exist in isolation—they need access roads, right-of-way preparation, and community resilience infrastructure along their routes. Using portions of this fund to develop corridor access or regional substations would reduce front-end costs and help rural and northern communities benefit from construction.

The budget’s new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund also fits indirectly into the picture. With $2 billion over five years earmarked for domestic supply chains, it can strengthen the industrial base needed for HVDC hardware. Voltage-source converters, high-voltage cables, and advanced transformers all depend on specialized metals and manufacturing. Canada has the minerals but little downstream processing. Strengthening that supply chain reduces import dependence and cost volatility for large-scale transmission builds.

Then there is the broader infrastructure envelope—$280 billion over five years. It is framed around protecting communities, building competitiveness, and modernizing assets. That language captures transmission as easily as it does bridges or transit. As provinces look to tap those funds, HVDC projects should be positioned as resilience investments: infrastructure that keeps industries operating, cities powered, and renewable energy moving during extreme weather.

Finally, the budget builds out Indigenous participation funding, from consultation support to equity financing structures. Every cross-country transmission project will intersect Indigenous territories, and inclusion is non-negotiable. These programs can underwrite equity stakes and build capacity so that Indigenous nations are partners, not stakeholders. The combination of Indigenous equity mechanisms and Infrastructure Bank participation could define the financial model of a twenty-first-century national grid—shared investment, shared governance, and shared benefit.

One of the most important details in the 2025 budget is the removal of restrictions that previously prevented provincial and territorial Crown corporations from accessing federal clean electricity tax credits. Those utilities own and operate most of Canada’s generation and transmission assets, yet they were originally excluded from the incentive structure designed to decarbonize them. By lifting that barrier, the federal government made the 15% Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and related programs truly usable by the entities capable of delivering large projects. This change turns what was once a symbolic measure into a practical financing tool, allowing provincially owned utilities like Hydro-Québec, Manitoba Hydro, BC Hydro, SaskPower, and NB Power to apply the credits directly to capital costs for HVDC interties and other major grid upgrades.

Together, these mechanisms create the financial and institutional scaffolding for a cross-Canada HVDC system. They are not labeled as such, but they are ready to be connected.

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit lowers the cost of capital for every eligible segment. The architecture of a national grid is already in the budget—it just needs to be built.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation Whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s Policies Are Costing Drivers More

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse-gas emission regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.","https://media.wired.com/photos/690c98a327a9fa6b4e201c19/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/e32fe4e60967b2faa0cc8d32427b3271af63fc94.jpeg",N,,2025-11-08 15:04:00.945807

They believe that Brazil will continue to use coal despite having over 80% of its electricity from renewable sources. As Brazil prepares to host the UN climate summit COP30, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed concern that the war in Ukraine has revived coal mining.

Coal plants, including Candiota, still supply 3% of Brazil’s electricity, highlighting the influence of special interest groups and the absence of a proper transition plan away from coal. Experts like Christine Shearer from Global Energy Monitor argue that Brazil has the resources to phase out coal, but the strong coal lobby in mining regions keeps these plants running.

The Candiota plant lost its government contract last year, leading to local economic downturns and outmigration. It now sells energy on the spot market during peak hours when solar and wind energy are less available. Nevertheless, Brazil’s Congress recently passed a bill allowing coal plants to operate until 2040, which Lula could potentially veto. The government also made coal eligible for a capacity auction aimed at improving energy security by using thermal plants during low renewable output.

Critics note that including coal in these plans contradicts the goal of energy flexibility, as coal plants cannot start quickly. They argue that poor long-term planning allows coal to persist, despite a surplus of clean energy that goes underutilized due to inadequate demand and transmission infrastructure. This situation makes the government susceptible to coal and natural gas lobbying, leading to higher financial and environmental costs.

Ambar asserts that coal from the Candiota plant is reliable and necessary for power supply, denying claims of relying on political influence. They also argue that critics prioritize the interests of large energy consumers over those of smaller entities and the broader public. Keeping coal operational aligns Brazil with countries like India and South Africa, where strong lobby groups impede efforts to transition away from coal, which is crucial to local economies.

Shutting down Candiota could result in around 10,000 job losses in the region. Local coal miner Jose Adolfo de Carvalho asserts that eliminating the plant won’t significantly impact global carbon issues. The future of the plant causes anxiety among residents, with former employee Graca dos Santos emphasizing the need for a just energy transition to avoid leaving the community jobless.

Lula’s administration lacks a transition plan for Candiota, and little progress has been made in strategizing for other coal facilities. Some suggest diversifying into sectors like beef, wine, and olive oil, which could provide new jobs for former coal workers. Local union leader Hermelindo Ferreira highlights the potential job losses from shutting down Candiota while recognizing that faith in the coal industry is wavering. Ferreira encourages workers to gain new skills, such as maintenance for wind energy, as a way to adapt to future opportunities.

Through proposed regulations, the Treasury Department has offered tax relief to private equity firms, crypto companies, foreign real estate investors, and other large corporations, the New York Times first reported.

For example, in October, the IRS issued new proposed regulations that would provide breaks to foreign investors in U.S. real estate. In August, the IRS proposed a rollback of rules to prevent multinational corporations from dodging taxes by claiming duplicate losses in multiple countries.

The notices have not made headlines, but have been flagged by accounting and consulting firms.

“Treasury has clearly been enacting unlegislated tax cuts,” Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the think-tank American Enterprise Institute, told the Times. “Congress determines tax law. Treasury undermines this constitutional principle when it asserts more authority over the structure of the tax code than Congress provides it.”

The recent IRS tax notices tack on to the tax relief laid out in President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which included the extension of the so-called “Trump tax cuts” from 2017 that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would reduce tax revenue by $4 trillion in the next decade.

The Independent has contacted the Treasury Department for comment.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” provides more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the top 5 percent of Americans, the Center for American Progress found.

The proposals target former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which ensured profitable corporations paid a minimum tax to combat inflation and reduce the federal deficit. That law generally required corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to pay 15 percent of the adjusted financial statement income.

A 2022 study suggested that only about 80 corporations would be subjected to this requirement. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the act would bring in $200 billion in revenue over the course of a decade.

In September, the IRS released notices regarding the 2002 minimum tax, issuing interim guidance that allows corporations to “disregard gains and losses that are unrealized for regular tax purposes” on its holdings of digital assets when calculating its adjusted financial statement income.

Strategy Inc, a crypto firm, announced it “no longer expects to become subject to” the minimum tax in light of the interim guidance, the company said in a SEC filing. Also citing the September guidance, natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy announced last month it was entitled to a refund of the previously paid minimum tax; the refund is worth $380 million, the Times reported.

A Treasury Department spokesperson told the Times the proposed regulations were “a practical approach that supports American investment and competitiveness” and were meant to replace the Biden administration’s “compliance maze that would have buried taxpayers in red tape.”

However, some experts have expressed concerns that the Treasury’s proposals could be contributing billions to the federal deficit — and could be exceeding its authority, as Congress is responsible for enacting federal tax laws.

Proposing regulations through the Treasury rather than passing laws through Congress means “you can just give away the goodies to one group, without having to take back anything from another,” Daniel Hemel, a law professor at New York University, told the paper. It’s a route that “that previous administrations have exploited and which the Trump administration is exploiting more aggressively,” Hemel said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3acc3e52ca135ec785677e7960006c1c,N,,2025-11-08 19:58:51.157836

The EU is contemplating its industrial decarbonization options as it aims to reach its 2030 clean energy goals. For far too long, the nuclear sector has largely been overlooked and at times completely ignored as a safe method to efficiently produce energy while not harming the environment, no more, says the EU.

The European Union is rolling out its first auction for industrial heat decarbonization

The heads of the EU Commission recently launched the very first pilot auction to decarbonize industrial heat. However, the new pilot auction does not include the nuclear sector, which has not stopped operators from commissioning atomic projects across the continent.

Europe has set itself some lofty and ambitious goals to decarbonize its energy sector by the end of the decade; however, the exclusion of the nuclear sector in its new auction round has raised fears over the continent’s ability to meet its self-imposed targets for decarbonization.

Process heat remains a major hindrance in the world’s decarbonization dreams

Processed heat from the industrial sector is among the speed bumps on the path towards a full-scale decarbonization of the energy sector, and several industry insiders have lamented the EU’s failure to prioritize the process heat issue as a main driver of the emissions problems that the world has been subjected to.

In October of this year, the EU launched the new and controversial initiative that aims to accelerate the decarbonization of the process heat created by energy operators on the continent. It should be noted that the nuclear sector has been excluded from the decarbonization initiative enacted by the EU Commission.

Despite the proclivity that Europe has for the unconventional, nuclear power on the continent is gaining momentum

Several industry experts have stated that process heat is the last piece of the puzzle that Europe and the world need to deal with in order to meet their decarbonization goals. The International Energy Agency, among the myriad of other energy sector watchdogs, has repeatedly flagged process heat as a major hindrance for the world in decarbonizing the energy sector.

Process heat accounts for a substantial amount of the energy sector’s emissions, and has been overlooked as the last hurdle that the world needs to jump over to meet its emission goals set out during the Paris Agreement in 2016.

Some European nations have not forgotten about the oldest of the renewable energy sources

Crucially, nuclear can alleviate the pressure to decarbonize, which is something that the EU seems to have forgotten. The cornerstone of the renewable energy sector has seen a substantial increase in commissioning as the world contemplates the best way to decarbonize process heat in the industrial sector.

Slovakia recently announced that it is evaluating US nuclear technology for a planned project that could transform the nation’s energy landscape.

Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence.
They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.
The path away from fossil fuels is not one of sacrifice, but of renewal — of cleaner air, healthier people, more secure societies, and flourishing economies.","As the world prepares to gather in Belém, Brazil, for COP30, we appeal to all heads of state and government representatives attending: let this be the moment when the world finally unites around a plan to transition away from fossil fuels within the next two decades. The responsible approach, the only moral and economic choice, is to start that transition immediately. COP30 must be the place where the world’s nations agree on concrete, collective steps to phase out the burning of coal, oil, and gas and build the clean energy future that is already within reach.

The science is unambiguous, and the consequences are visible everywhere: devastating floods, heatwaves, fires and droughts are erasing decades of progress in development and social justice. The planetary emergency is not a distant threat — it is a direct attack on the world’s hard-won goals of eradicating poverty, ending hunger, protecting the environment and ensuring peace and stability. Every tonne of carbon emitted deepens inequality and undermines the foundations of human progress. No nation, no matter how wealthy or isolated, is immune.

Development and fossil fuels were once intertwined, but today that link is broken. Continuing to rely on fossil fuels no longer brings prosperity — it brings destruction. It erodes food security, drives migration, increases health costs and inflames conflicts. Around the world, communities that have contributed least to the problem are suffering the most from its effects. That is neither just nor sustainable. The only way to secure a stable and peaceful century is to phase out the burning of fossil fuels and replace them with clean, renewable and equitable sources of energy.

We also recognise the real challenges of getting there, particularly in developing nations where energy demand continues to rise and fossil fuels still underpin many economies. Leaders of nations across Latin America, Asia and Africa face intense pressures over oil expansion. This makes global solidarity and strong support essential for a just and achievable transition.

This transition is not a burden — it is an opportunity of historic proportions. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted over the past decade. Solar and wind power are now the cheapest sources of new electricity in most countries. Clean technologies like electric mobility, energy storage, green hydrogen and smart grids are advancing faster than anyone predicted. Across Africa, Asia, Latin America and beyond, distributed solar systems and mini-grids are bringing electricity to people who never had it before — quickly, affordably and without pollution. In cities and rural areas alike, these technologies are creating jobs, improving health, and giving communities control over their own energy futures.

Business leaders already understand this. Investments in renewable energy, green infrastructure and sustainable industries are not just ethical choices; they are the most rational economic ones. Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence. Renewables are also inherently more secure for nations that currently rely on imported fossil fuels, reducing vulnerability to price shocks and geopolitical disruption. By contrast, fossil fuels expose countries to volatile prices, geopolitical instability, and stranded assets. The clean transition is, in every sense, the pathway to economic resilience and prosperity.

Addressing these challenges demands a major lift in climate and transition finance. Without it, the world’s most vulnerable nations cannot move at the speed required. We also recognize that this transition must be fair and inclusive. Workers, communities and developing nations that currently depend on fossil fuel economies deserve support and partnership to diversify and thrive. This requires international cooperation, not competition — coordination, not isolation. The task before us is vast, but the cost of inaction is immeasurably greater.

This is why COP30 is so crucial. Three decades after the Rio Earth Summit first placed sustainable development at the center of global diplomacy, and 10 years after the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world returns to Brazil facing an existential challenge. Belém offers a symbolic and practical opportunity to realign global ambition with planetary reality. Leaders must arrive ready to go beyond words and targets. They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.

The tools are in our hands. The economics are on our side. The moral case is undeniable. What is needed now is courage and unity. The world has shown before that when faced with a global challenge, we can act together — to end wars, cure diseases, and rebuild after crises. This is one of those moments.

As you and representatives from your governments gather in Brazil, you have a chance to show future generations that you rose to meet the defining test of our time.

But BMW is confident it has the right strategy to combat the challenges. I talked to BMW Board Member Ilka Horstmeier about how the company plans to cope with current automotive uncertainties.

BMW’s Bet On Electrification Is More Of A Hedge

BMW’s launch of the first Neue Klasse cars would imply that it’s focusing on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) just as US ambivalence towards electrification is growing. Indeed, the company ceased making internal combustion engines (ICE) at its oldest, flagship plant in Munich in November 2023, moving production to Steyr in Austria and Hams Hall in the UK. Instead, Munich will exclusively make BEVs, and BMW has simultaneously been retooling the plant for the Neue Klasse sedan while continuing to manufacture up to 1,000 cars a day.

However, the official BMW strategy, as explained to me recently by Chairman Oliver Zipse, is to keep its options open. As the US market for EVs softens while Europe and China press ahead, BMW’s global production footprint provides some resilience, and the ability to vary its plans by region. “We didn't need to adjust our strategy overall,” says Horstmeier. “Even three years ago, we were saying that we don't put all our eggs in one basket, because times are volatile. Even in Europe, the prerequisites for 100% electric are not there and will not be there until the 2030s. Either it's charging infrastructure or affordable green energy.”

BMW’s philosophy has long been that there is more to sustainable automaking than just switching to battery electric vehicles. “We remain technology open, while at the same time reducing the CO2 footprint of the whole value chain,” says Horstmeier. “This is what counts for climate change and not what the drivetrain of a car is. We don’t need to fundamentally change our strategy. We're adjusting volumes and what type of car we produce in which plant.” This strategy not only addresses the uneven transition to electro mobility, but also the tariff fluctuations that have buffeted the year so far. “You never know what's happening the next day. But the genetic code of our production network and system is flexibility. That's the reason why we can react better to changes than others. Most of our plants can produce all the drivetrains in their production system.”

BMW Facing Chip Challenges, But Batteries Remain Problematic

One change that BMW has been having to react to recently has been the chip supply issues caused by the Dutch government’s takeover of Nexperia and China’s reaction of limiting exports. “We have shown in the chip environment we had in 2021-22 that we are very adaptive with regard to these types of volatility,” argues Horstmeier, referring to a previous chip shortage that shocked the automotive market. “We are watching what is happening. We are in close contact with our suppliers regarding what they can supply daily. And we make decisions as late as possible, because that was the differentiator in 21-22 with that chip shortage. We always use our own flexibility instruments.” At the time of writing, the Nexperia chip challenge was showing signs of receding.

However, as the European market moves inexorably towards EVs, despite US reticence, a more fundamental weakness is evident: the lack of local battery production. “An electric car needs a battery, that's for sure,” says Horstmeier. This threat is accentuated by hard targets of ending internal combustion engine sales by 2035 in the EU and UK, which makes the lack of local battery supply a strategic threat to European automakers. “Every car manufacturer in that situation must look for resilience in their supply chain. But there are not that many options that we have. We use all suppliers. In the short term, the game has been played. But in the long term the biggest task for the European Union is to really think about how to allocate European battery production in Europe. I'm not talking about Chinese suppliers coming to Europe. I'm talking about really building up European battery manufacturing. This generation of batteries is done. We must look for the next generation and the whole supply chain, because it's not only battery and cell production, but also about all the raw materials you need. A strategic plan now in Europe to look for the next generation of batteries, and what we can do there, would be helpful. That's what we are talking about with the European Commission.”

Horstmeier isn’t implying that Europe has been caught doing nothing but argues that greater unity of purpose is required. She compares the situation to charging infrastructure, where manufacturers joined forces to create the necessary high-speed charging network for long-distance EV driving. BMW is part of the consortium behind IONITY, alongside Ford, Hyundai Motor Group, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group. “We have a lot of discussions in Europe about how to allocate battery production here,” she explains. But the first point is that we don’t only need battery production. If we look at resilient supply chains, we need raw materials. We need all the prerequisites for battery cell production. Then we must look for the production sites. It's a joint effort. In the next years, we must see whether we are all together and really move the needle in a different direction.”

From BMW Circularity To Solid State

Obtaining the necessary minerals for local European battery production is one reason why BMW sees its push towards recycling and a circular material economy as so crucial. With a circular recycling ecosystem, the minerals in existing batteries can be extracted to create new ones. That way, even if the batteries were originally imported, their minerals stay in Europe when built into new European vehicles.

That still leaves the issue of manufacturing. Europe has had obvious problems building up strong local battery cell production. Northvolt filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and the UK’s Britishvolt failed before even constructing a factory. “You need a couple of prerequisites,” says Horstmeier. “You need the raw materials. You need to understand where to get them from and how to secure them. You need the competency to build up cells efficiently.” Horstemeier argues that BMW is in a good position here because it has invested in a battery competence center, based in Munich, which opened in 2019. The company also has local high-voltage assembly plants in Woodruff, South Carolina (USA), Irlbach-Straßkirchen, Lower Bavaria (Germany), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí (Mexico). “We know what a battery looks like, but the industrialization and scaling are tricky tasks, even for experienced cell manufacturers. Whenever battery technology changes, it’s quite a while until production runs stable.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/690e2faf5242d8c03002f6c0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1553,873,x242,y459,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-11-08 14:03:36.642233

St. Louis Community Credit Union used its certification as a Community Development Financial Institution to invest more than $40 million in loans.
The Community Development Financial Institution Fund is a nonpartisan program that meets these standards.","Revitalizing American communities and industries has been a core priority for the Trump administration. Congress and federal agencies are pursuing policies aimed at increasing financial resilience and spurring economic growth with this priority in mind, while also providing relief to millions of Americans and Main Streets across the country.

In my former role as president of America’s Credit Unions, I saw a program with a proven track record of success accomplish this goal. It is the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides federal grants for projects that drive business development, job creation, affordable housing and financial literacy.

Across the country, 1,400-plus institutions in this program provide more than $300 billion in financial services each year, serving communities that struggle with these issues, from rural and Native American communities to low-income neighborhoods across the country.

Unfortunately, as part of the ongoing government shutdown and resulting reduction-in-force plans, the entire staff of the fund received notice their positions are being eliminated. This raises huge questions about the future of the fund and the future of nearly 500 participating credit unions.

Every Community Development Financial Institution Fund dollar granted to a credit union generates $12 in private investment. This has helped credit unions invest $85 billion in community mortgage lending, $91 billion in local consumer financing, $30 billion in lending to local businesses and $18 billion in affordable small dollar loans and alternatives to payday loans.

For example, Lake Trust Credit Union has issued $5 million in microloans in Michigan by treating small business funding as personal loans, which results in approvals in days rather than weeks. This investment allows local entrepreneurs to launch and scale businesses while supporting their community.

In Missouri, Alltru Credit Union embedded its no-cost Employee Wellness Benefits Program with two 30-employee firms: a STEAM-focused child care center and an in-home health-care agency. The program offers on-site credit-builder loans, fee-free Health Savings Accounts and small emergency lines, helping owners retain talent while giving workers the tools to steady household budgets.

St. Louis Community Credit Union used its certification as a Community Development Financial Institution to invest more than $40 million in loans. The credit union serves more than 52,000 members and has been able to bridge the gap between mission-driven institutions and local entrepreneurs, channeling resources in ways that improve household stability, generate jobs, and fuel economic development.

Support for the fund is bipartisan and bicameral. Last month, the Senate included a package of improvements to the fund in its passage of the National Defense Authorization Act.

This provision would increase congressional oversight of the fund, expanding a congressional and regulatory foundation to offer safe credit, small business finance, affordable housing and wealth building.

A recent bicameral effort led by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) highlighted the impact of these financial institutions to the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget.

Government programs must be effective and cost efficient to protect taxpayers. The Community Development Financial Institution Fund is a nonpartisan program that meets these standards. With positive impact on communities, return on investment and strong bipartisan support, the fund’s dissolution is not the answer.

The fund works — it turns small amounts of federal dollars into truly impactful investments in communities. By preserving the fund, Congress will ensure it can meet its statutory mission once the shutdown ends.

We urge the administration to examine how the fund can support its priorities in financial resilience and economic growth, and, through this program, allow credit unions to continue unleashing domestic economic opportunity in communities across America.

Hilary Starcher-O’Toole is the executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC).","The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection recently announced a plan to certify the Shell plastics plant’s air permit in Beaver County as meeting the federal “reasonably available control technology” (RACT) requirements for ozone pollution.

This certification, published in the Oct. 4 Pennsylvania Bulletin, claims that Shell’s permit already contains the necessary controls to meet the Clean Air Act’s 2015 ozone standards. I believe Shell’s dozens of notices of violation – including rolling 12-month exceedances of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – show otherwise.

As a lifelong Beaver County resident and executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC), I find this determination deeply concerning. Residents living near Shell have endured repeated flaring events, strong chemical odors and air quality violations since the plant began operations. To suggest that Shell’s permit meets “best available” standards without transparent public review or meaningful on-site inspections by the DEP ispremature and disregards what Beaver County residents have witnessed firsthand.

Let’s be clear: NOx is a critical precursor to ozone formation. When a major facility like Shell repeatedly exceeds permitted NOx limits, the risks to local and downwind ozone levels don’t vanish. For context, Beaver County remains designated as a nonattainment area for ozone under the 2015 federal standard, meaning our air still fails to meet the health-based limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency. This designation reflects ongoing violations of national air quality standards meant to protect the public from smog-related respiratory and cardiovascular harm.

The DEP’s notice triggers a 30-day public comment period, which has been extended to Nov. 21. This is the public’s opportunity to demand accountability and insist that regulators fully examine the facility’s record of violations, equipment malfunctions and community impacts before granting federal certification.

Beaver County families deserve a permitting process based on evidence and accountability, not expedience.

Residents can submit comments to RA-EPAIRCOMMENTS@pa.gov through Nov. 21. They might also question why the public hearing was held in Allegheny County during work hours when Beaver County residents are the ones living with the consequences of ongoing malfunctions.

Please don’t underestimate this process. Once certified, the state will send Shell’s permit to the EPA as part of Pennsylvania’s official Clean Air Act compliance plan. This decision will shape how Shell is regulated for years to come. Our public comments become part of the official record – a reflection of whether we stood by silently or spoke out to defend the health of our families, neighbors and friends, and the future of our region when we had the chance.

The U.S. Government Shutdown: What Does it Mean for Your Flights?

The U.S. government shutdown is wreaking havoc across the nation, and airports are bearing the brunt of this financial disaster. Detroit, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Newark, and Anchorage are facing major flight reductions due to the shutdown.

Thousands of passengers are already feeling the consequences, and the worst is yet to come. In this article, we will expose the cold truth about how this government shutdown is directly impacting these key U.S. airports. If you’re flying soon, especially from these hubs, keep reading to uncover the devastating effects and how they will affect your plans.

Flight Cancellations Surge: What’s Behind the Chaos at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport?

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), a major hub in Michigan, is one of the first to face drastic cuts as a result of the U.S. government shutdown. Over 4% of flights at DTW have already been cancelled, with more disruptions expected. Experts are warning that if the shutdown continues, flight cancellations could surge by as much as 10%.

DTW is struggling under the weight of unpaid air traffic controllers, and the FAA has ordered reductions at 40 of the busiest airports nationwide. For Detroit, this means heightened stress, delays, and frustration for travelers. Already, dozens of people are stranded or forced to reschedule their flights as the airport struggles to keep up with demand.

The impact of the shutdown on DTW should not be underestimated. The airport is experiencing a sharp decline in flight reliability, and travellers can expect much longer waiting times. If you’re flying from Detroit, it’s essential to check your flight status frequently. This shutdown is not only disrupting your travel plans but also creating an unpredictable environment where flight operations could change without warning. The financial implications are enormous.

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Faces Flight Reductions Amid FAA Cuts

As of November 7, 2025, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) is among the airports affected by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) flight reduction measures. This decision comes as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown continues to impact air traffic operations, leading to cancellations and delays at major airports across the country.

The FAA’s flight reduction initiative aims to alleviate strain on the air traffic control system, which is operating under reduced staffing due to the shutdown. As a result, travelers flying through DTW may experience disruptions, including flight cancellations, longer wait times, and delays in processing.

Stay Informed and Prepared

If you’re planning to travel through DTW in the coming days, it’s crucial to stay updated on your flight’s status. We recommend that passengers regularly check with their airline for real-time information on cancellations or changes to their flight schedule. With the FAA’s flight reductions in place, certain flights may be canceled, and the schedule could change unexpectedly.

To help you stay ahead of potential disruptions, here are some key tips for navigating these challenging conditions:

Download Your Airline’s App and Enable Notifications:

Most airlines offer apps that provide live updates and notifications. By enabling push notifications, you’ll receive the most accurate and immediate alerts about any changes to your flight, including cancellations, gate changes, and delays.

Check Your Flight Status Before Heading to the Airport:

Always verify your flight’s status with your airline before leaving for DTW. This simple step can save you time and ensure that you’re not caught off guard by last-minute cancellations or delays. Airline websites and mobile apps provide the most up-to-date information regarding your flight.

Ensure Your Contact Information is Current:

Make sure your airline has your correct and up-to-date contact information. Airlines often rely on this data to send crucial updates, such as schedule changes or flight cancellations. If you’ve changed your phone number or email address since booking, take a moment to update your details with the airline to ensure you don’t miss any important notifications.

Pack Your Patience:

Given the current situation, delays and cancellations are more likely, so it’s important to approach your travel with a sense of patience. With air traffic control and staffing issues at play, things may take longer than usual. Arriving early at the airport and allowing plenty of time for check-in and security is essential, especially if your flight is affected by the reduction measures.

The Impact on DTW and What It Means for Travelers

While DTW is a major hub for domestic and international flights, it is now facing the same challenges that other high-traffic airports are dealing with under the FAA’s flight reduction order. These cuts are necessary due to the reduced availability of air traffic controllers, many of whom are working without pay due to the ongoing government shutdown.

In light of these circumstances, the airport is urging travelers to be proactive and flexible with their plans. The Airport Authority, airlines, and federal partners are working diligently to manage the evolving situation, but the travel experience will inevitably be affected.

By staying informed and prepared, you can minimize the stress of these travel disruptions and ensure a smoother experience when flying through Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we all adapt to the challenges posed by the ongoing government shutdown.

Honolulu’s Travel Nightmare: Government Shutdown Forces Severe Flight Cuts

Honolulu International Airport (HNL), also known as Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, is another key player in the ongoing shutdown saga. The FAA has ordered drastic reductions here as well, even though Hawaii’s airports typically experience fewer disruptions.

HNL is a vital link between the U.S. mainland and the Pacific. For tourists and business travellers alike, this disruption is catastrophic. The government shutdown means less air traffic control staff, creating delays and increased risk of cancellations. Flights are being reduced by around 4%, and in the coming weeks, it’s likely this number will rise as more airports face strain.

Honolulu’s tourism industry, which is heavily reliant on smooth air travel, is feeling the pinch. The impact extends beyond just travellers — the entire Hawaiian economy will suffer unless swift action is taken. The government shutdown, at least for now, is casting a dark shadow over Hawaii’s bustling airport and further exacerbating the challenges for a destination already struggling with rising costs and visitor numbers.

Orlando International Airport: A Perfect Storm for Flight Disruptions

Orlando International Airport (MCO) is facing a perfect storm as the government shutdown escalates. With 4% of flights already being slashed, the pressure is mounting on the city’s busiest gateway. And that’s not the worst of it — experts are warning that the airport could experience up to a 10% reduction in flights, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded during the busy holiday season.

For those travelling to Orlando for family vacations or business, the situation is becoming more precarious. The city’s theme parks, conventions, and events depend heavily on uninterrupted flight schedules, but now that dream is shattering. Airports like MCO are the first to feel the impact, with delays and cancellations worsening by the day. Airlines are scrambling to accommodate passengers, but the reality is, there is only so much they can do when the very systems they rely on are compromised by the shutdown.

Expect your Orlando trip to be fraught with unexpected delays and longer-than-usual wait times. The longer the shutdown drags on, the worse it gets, and the 10% reduction forecast is just the beginning. If you have a flight booked from Orlando, the situation is only going to get worse.

Portland International Airport Faces Growing Strain from US Shutdown

Portland International Airport (PDX) is not immune to the ongoing chaos. With the FAA slashing air traffic at 40 airports, Portland has found itself caught in the crossfire. The growing strain on resources is evident as more cancellations are reported each day.

PDX is a smaller airport compared to some of the others on this list, but it’s still a crucial hub for those travelling across the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, the government shutdown means fewer staff, longer wait times, and a higher likelihood of flight delays.

Local reports indicate that delays could worsen in the coming weeks, with travellers facing an uncertain future. As air traffic control issues compound the challenges at PDX, passengers are urged to remain vigilant, prepared for longer waits, and ready to adjust their travel plans.

Chicago Midway International Airport Faces Major Flight Cancellations

Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW) is another major airport grappling with the fallout of the shutdown. Known for its high volume of Southwest Airlines flights, MDW is already experiencing delays, and with over 4% of flights cancelled, things aren’t looking good for passengers flying in and out of this key hub.

Midway’s status as a secondary airport in the Windy City doesn’t shield it from the chaos wreaking havoc on major airports. Flight cancellations and delays are inevitable as the FAA struggles to cope with the ongoing staffing shortages. For travellers, the message is clear: If you’re flying out of Chicago Midway, expect to encounter problems that could cause major disruptions to your schedule.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport: A Disaster in the Making

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is one of the busiest airports in the world and certainly one of the most important for air travel in the U.S. With the government shutdown affecting air traffic control operations nationwide, ATL is struggling to keep up.

Already, passengers are seeing flight cancellations, delays, and unpredictable flight schedules. The 10% reduction forecast for high-traffic airports like ATL will cause significant issues. The airport’s size and volume mean the number of disruptions is far greater here than at many other airports.

For those planning to travel through ATL, expect long lines, increased stress, and potentially even flight rerouting. The FAA’s mandated reductions are taking a toll on all U.S. airports, and ATL is no exception. With the shutdown likely to continue, the pressure on air travel is set to mount even further.

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport: More Trouble Amid Shutdown

The impact of the government shutdown is not just confined to the major hubs. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) is also feeling the pinch. Although it doesn’t boast the same volume of traffic as some of the larger airports, CVG is still a critical airport for regional flights.

Passengers here are facing reduced services and higher chances of cancellations as the shutdown reduces FAA oversight. While the airport may not face the same sheer volume of disruption as larger airports, those flying from CVG should still prepare for significant delays and service reductions.

Newark Liberty International Airport Faces Worsening Travel Disruptions

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is on the frontline of the ongoing shutdown. As one of the largest international airports in the country, Newark is bracing for an influx of cancellations. The 4% flight reduction initially forecast could escalate quickly, leading to delays, cancellations, and more passenger frustration.

For passengers trying to catch international flights or connecting through Newark, this means potential chaos. Already, major airlines are warning of potential disruptions as the shutdown continues, and Newark is at the centre of these changes.

Anchorage International Airport Struggles to Cope with Shutdown Chaos

Anchorage International Airport (ANC) may be remote, but that hasn’t shielded it from the fallout of the government shutdown. As the FAA reduces flight capacity across the country, even this less-busy airport is seeing the effects. Anchorage’s role as a key hub for Alaskan and international flights has made it vulnerable to disruptions.

For those travelling through ANC, the shutdown will likely create delays, especially on flights that rely on specific air traffic control staffing. While the shutdown might not have the same magnitude of impact here as in other cities, travellers should remain cautious and monitor their flight status closely.

FAA Announces Flight Reductions Amid U.S. Government Shutdown to Ensure Air Travel Safety

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Bryan Bedford outlined proactive measures to ensure the highest safety standards in the national airspace system during the ongoing government shutdown. These measures include a temporary 10 percent reduction in flights at 40 high-traffic airports across the country.

Since the shutdown began, air traffic controllers have been working without pay, leading to mounting staffing issues at air traffic facilities nationwide. This strain on the system has resulted in increased delays and concerns about safety, with 2,740 delays reported just this past weekend.

“This isn’t about politics – it’s about assessing the data and alleviating the risks as controllers continue to work without pay,” said Secretary Duffy. “It’s safe to fly today, and it will continue to be safe next week because of the proactive actions we are taking.”

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford added, “We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely.”

Flight Reductions Timeline and Key Actions

A 4 percent reduction in operations will take effect Friday, November 7, with gradual increases:

6 percent by November 11

8 percent by November 13

10 percent by November 14

Additionally, the FAA will impose restrictions on certain operations:

Prohibit some visual flight rule approaches (VFR) at affected facilities.

Commercial space launches and reentries will be restricted to 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time.

Parachute operations and photo missions near impacted facilities will be prohibited.

These actions are based on the FAA’s review of aviation safety data, including voluntary, confidential safety reports filed by pilots and air traffic controllers. The data points to increased stress, which heightens safety risks.

Refunds and International Flights

Airlines are required to issue full refunds for affected flights, though secondary costs, such as accommodations, will not be covered. Importantly, the FAA’s flight reduction measures do not extend to international flights. Carriers will have the discretion to decide which domestic flights to cancel to meet the required reductions.

The list of 40 impacted high-traffic airports includes major hubs like Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Honolulu International Airport (HNL), and Orlando International Airport (MCO), among others.

What You Need to Know About Travel During the US Government Shutdown

The government shutdown is not just a political crisis; it’s a full-blown travel disaster. Major airports like Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, Chicago Midway, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky, Newark Liberty, and Anchorage are facing serious disruptions. Flight reductions are already in place, and unless the government shutdown ends soon, more cuts are inevitable. Passengers are facing the possibility of long delays, cancellations, and a ripple effect that could cause travel chaos across the country.

If you’re planning to fly out of any of these airports, stay vigilant, check flight statuses regularly, and be prepared for longer-than-usual wait times. The government shutdown has created a perfect storm for flight disruptions, and only those who are well-prepared will manage to avoid the worst of the chaos.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Detroit-International-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 14:03:41.172297

Solar power is now the fastest, most economical way to introduce more kilowatts into the US grid, and things are about to get a lot more interesting. Traditional silicon solar cells are relatively expensive and difficult to manufacture compared to the up-and-coming crop of photovoltaic technologies to emerge from the lab. In particular, new perovskite solar cells are finally beginning to hit the marketplace.

The Perovskite Solar Cell Story

The first practical silicon solar cell was introduced by Bell Labs in New Jersey back in 1954. However, widespread adoption is a 21st century phenomenon, spurred by accelerating cycles of falling costs and rising demand, leading to economies of scale that force prices down even farther with every cycle.

Those cycles will continue to pick up steam in the coming years. Although solar is already competitive with fossil fuels in many markets globally, solar innovators have not stopped trying to push the cost of solar cells down even farther, and perovskites are part of the effort.

Perovskites are lab-grown crystals that follow the structure of calcium titanate, also found in the mineral perovskite. By way of illustrating the rapid pace of innovation today, perovskite was first identified in nature back in 1839. However, its application to solar cells did not surface for another 170 years. A team of researchers in Japan reported the first perovskite solar cell in 2009, with a solar conversion efficiency of 3.8%. Today, just 16 years later, researchers around the world are routinely hitting double digits for perovskite solar conversion efficiency (see more perovskite background here).

Solving The Perovskite Solar Cell Puzzle

The road to a marketable perovskite solar cell has been a relatively short one, but a difficult one. Perovskites are extremely fragile, defying practical applications until researchers could figure out how to engineer durability and longevity without sacrificing solar conversion efficiency.

One promising workaround is a tandem approach that deploys layers of perovskites and silicon. Silicon is the longtime semiconductor of choice for mass-marketed solar cells. It is relatively expensive compared to perovskites, so combining the two yields a high-efficiency solar cell that is less expensive than silicon alone. The tandem approach also delivers a lighter, more flexible solar cell than silicon alone.

Among the innovators focusing on tandem perovskite solar cells is the US startup Swift Solar. The company is new to the pages of CleanTechnica, so a bit of catchup is in order.

The Acid Test For Perovskite Durability

Swift Solar co-founder and MIT engineer Joel Jean introduced his company’s perovskite solar cells in 2019. The company has focused on stacking different types of perovskites in a solar cell, boosting efficiency by absorbing different parts of the solar spectrum. As of 2019, Jean anticipated a solar conversion efficiency potential of more than 30% for its all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

The company has since adopted tandem perovskite-silicon technology while ramping into manufacturing mode. “Swift Solar’s proprietary next-generation perovskite tandem technology outperforms legacy silicon solar technologies, generating up to 30% more power than today’s solar panels,” the company asserts.

In August of this year, Swift’s US-made perovskite tandem solar cells were featured in the Defense Department’s annual Cyber Fortress exercise in Virginia, hosted by the 91st Cyber Brigade at Fort Belvoir and the Information Operations Support Center of the Virginia National Guard.

This year’s exercise focused in preparedness for a cyberattack on an electric cooperative (electric cooperatives are member-supported utilities that form the backbone of the US power grid), featuring multiple US agencies as well as students, electric co-ops, and representatives from other countries, including Finland, Sweden, Latvia.

As part of the exercise, Swift’s technology was integrated with a hybrid microgrid engineered by the firm Resilient Energy & Infrastructure. “Swift Solar’s perovskite tandem solar panels provided clean energy alongside two other power sources during a critical infrastructure cyber defense exercise,” Swift explains.

“DoD leadership, Army operational energy specialists, and private sector partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS) were on hand to learn about and observe the DoD’s latest operational energy capabilities,” Swift adds.

A Next-Level, Solar-Enabled Microgrid For The DoD

“The exercise demonstrated the potential for Swift Solar’s technology to support energy resilience for national defense operations,” Swift concludes.

Don’t just take their word for it. In a press release dated October 24, Swift cited the Cyber Fortress Lead for the US Army, Dr. Andre Slonopas, who reported that “US-made perovskite solar technology can directly address the growing power demands of the modern battlefield and enhance overall military readiness.”

As for solar technology in general, don’t just take Slonopas’s word for it, either. The US Army has been pushing the market for solar-enabled microgrids and lightweight, transportable solar technology since the early 2000s, to help secure a more nimble, flexible, scavenge-able power supply for the geared-up Soldier of today.

Resilient CEO Paul Maloney also chipped his two cents into Swift’s press release, taking note of the potential for perovskite solar cells to take his company’s “Rapid Deployment Hybrid MicroGrid” technology to the next level.

“For our mobile RDHMs, where space, weight, and agility are mission-critical factors for operational energy, we envision Swift Solar’s perovskite as vastly increasing the energy density we can deploy, while enhancing energy resilience for military operations,” Maloney explained.

Resilient is laser-focused on integrating solar and energy storage into transportable microgrids. Its portfolio includes the proprietary “SolFlex” solar array, designed to unfold and fold back up, accordion-style, enabling the entire system to be recovered and transported elsewhere. “Key facet: No stranded asset risk,” the company emphasizes.

“REI’s objective is to address a significant disequilibrium between legacy, inefficient, and antiquated centralized systems and more modern, resilient, and efficiency-optimized distributed systems-of-systems,” Resilient emphasizes again for good measure.

Next Steps For The US Solar Industry

Beyond the potential for use in microgrids, Swift indicates that DoD is also interested in electromagnetic applications and space-based missions, among other fields. With plans to scale up its manufacturing systems over the next two years, Swift takes note of private sector interest among leading industries, including power generation, satellite operations, and telecommunications.

No kidding. It’s difficult to make an economical case for any other power generation resource in the US under the current state of energy technology today, with the ability to address mobile and transportable energy needs on up to utility-scale power plants. If you can think of one, drop a note in the comment thread.

Even though it would seem that the United States, Mexico, and Canada are in an era of increasing political tension and division, the common strategic priorities of the North American bloc far overshadow the divergences and competing interests. Strengthening energy trade and mutual support to ramp up energy production and localized energy and manufacturing supply chains would be a win-win-win for all three parties, but will require a particularly heavy lift on the part of Mexico.

“Within this trilateral relationship,” reports the Atlantic Council, “Mexico’s role in particular could lean into its domestic priorities to expand energy infrastructure, strengthen its electric vehicle and semiconductor sectors, and develop its mineral wealth.”

The Atlantic Council, a longstanding bipartisan think tank dedicated to issues of international coordination and security, recently released a 14-page policy brief arguing for enhanced cooperation between North American nations in order to be able to compete with China in global energy value chains. As Mexico, Canada, and the United States have prioritized protectionist policies and fractured nationalism over the last decade, China has increasingly consolidated global supply chains and currently exerts a great deal of control over international energy markets, especially in emerging economies. The Atlantic Council argues that counteracting this precarious consolidation will require a course correction and a return to convergence, coordination, and cooperation on the part of North American nations, who will stand stronger together than divided in a rapidly changing global market.

While the governments of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have had loud and contentious tiffs against the backdrop of the Trump administrations (see: 51st state, wall) the three economies remain highly dependent on each other, and politically entangled in inextricable and bilateral ways. Smoothing over trade tensions in light of those dependencies is therefore strongly in the nations’ favor.

Although China is unmatched in terms of energy spending and its rapid expansion of energy influence, supply chains, and investment into energy assets in emerging economies, the Atlantic Council argues that North America is well-positioned to challenge China’s runaway dominance if it can play to its historic strengths.

“North America’s energy abundance has positioned the region as the world’s dominant energy exporter,” states the October policy brief. “The United States leads global LNG exports, Canada supplies critical oil and gas resources, and Mexico’s emerging Pacific Coast LNG projects will provide direct access to Asian markets. This collective export capacity creates shared prosperity through export revenues while offering democratic allies alternatives to authoritarian energy suppliers, transforming energy integration from an economic opportunity into a geopolitical asset.”

This plan hinges on Mexico’s ambitious energy planning – including the Plan Mexico policy – as laid out by its new president Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico is critical to the nearshoring ambitions of the United States and Canada, who seek to shorten and strengthen localized supply chains in the interest of energy security, independence, and sovereignty, not to mention increased control within global markets. Mexico also has enormous and largely untapped potential for green energy production.

“Through Plan Mexico, the current administration has outlined an ambitious economic transformation strategy that prioritizes manufacturing growth, critical mineral development, and energy security—priorities that align with US and Canadian interests in building more resilient regional supply chains,” writes the Atlantic Council.

Increased North American energy cooperation is also critical to keeping Mexico’s alliances pointed north rather than East. China has been rapidly expanding its presence in energy sectors across Latin America, and Mexico would be a highly strategic trade partner for Beijing. Isolating and alienating Mexico from North American cooperation would push the country toward Beijing, with likely disastrous consequences for policy and economic goals for the entire continent.

Sweden is also one of the world’s most generous international climate finance donors, which contributes to both emissions reduction and climate adaptation.

Sweden highlights the Swedish business community’s solutions for reduced emissions and greater resilience, and how such solutions can contribute to a faster transition. After the UN Climate Change Conference COP29 in Baku, Minister for Climate and the Environment Romina Pourmokhtari and Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Benjamin Dousa sent a letter to the parties to the Paris Agreement to highlight that there are a number of technical solutions and innovations that could already be applied in climate work and that Swedish companies can offer.

Sweden as the climate matchmaker

Business Sweden published its report ‘Sweden – The Climate Matchmaker for Global Action’ report during UN Climate Week in September 2025. The report has been produced for COP30 to help countries match their climate challenges with existing Swedish solutions and thereby dare to raise the ambition of their national climate plans (NDCs) and make them more feasible and attractive for public and private investment.

The Swedish offering is embodied in the ‘Sweden – The Climate Matchmaker’ campaign, in which areas of interest can be matched with solutions.

Business Sweden is responsible for the Swedish Pavilion at COP30 and will also bring a delegation of Swedish government agencies and companies from a number of different sectors to COP30.

A generous donor of international climate finance

Sweden is one of the world’s most generous donors of international climate finance. This will contribute to both emissions reductions and climate adaptation. Through climate aid, Sweden contributed to the world reaching the goal of USD 100 billion in global climate finance a year by 2022. Since then, the Swedish Government has made substantial investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of climate aid. In 2024, Swedish climate aid reached a record high at just over SEK 11.1 billion, an increase of SEK 1.5 billion compared to the previous year. Compared with 2022, this is an increase of around SEK 2.5 billion, approximately 29 per cent.

Sweden is one of the largest donors to multilateral development banks and climate funds such as the Global Environment Fund and the Green Climate Fund.

The government agencies play an important role

Several Swedish government agencies are working on support for capacity building and climate investments on behalf of the Government.

The Swedish Energy Agency

The Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for Sweden’s international climate action programme. The aim is to develop international collaborations and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Swedish Energy Agency is working to develop international climate cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. As a result, Sweden today has cooperation agreements under the Paris Agreement with a number of countries, for example, Ghana, Kenya and Nepal, and cooperates with various international organisations.

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency conducts a number of bilateral collaborations with a large number of countries in various projects in the field of environment and climate. This makes it possible to develop effective environmental administration and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda and to Sweden’s own environmental quality objectives.

One example is the Strengthening Zambian Mining Governance in The Nexus of Environment, Human Rights, and Climate (ZAMNEX) programme, which aims to improve the sustainability of the Zambian mining sector with focus on aspects of the environment, human rights and climate change. This project concluded in September 2026.

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency also has the role of national focal point for gender equality and climate change under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement states that the climate transition must take place with regard to human rights and that it must promote gender equality. Gender equality has been part of the Climate Convention since 2001 and is now a permanent agenda item at meetings of the parties. In 2025, a new action plan is expected to be adopted at COP30 in Belém.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is responsible for Sweden’s development cooperation. It focuses on the themes that are considered especially important for combating global poverty, including climate and the environment. Sida’s bilateral support goes to 36 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe.

Sida specifically works with climate and the environment through targeted projects and climate and environment programmes; climate- and environmental integration within other sectors dialogue and policy advocacy and capital mobilisation.

Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.
This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.
“Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rainforest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the centre left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he said his priority was social development, but humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the loss of forests.

He said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to – in a fair and planned way – reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates Brazil’s emissions – which are mainly determined by the health of its forests – have fallen by 16.7%, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 economies.

These gains were front and centre as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at Cop30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn (£95bn) for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5bn, with investments of $3bn from Norway, $1bn each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilisation, water transport and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, where there has been a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction is the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an Earth system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rainforest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4bn years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

Lula, however, relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. “Ruralista” politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swathes of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licences for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas off the coast of the rainforest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have – until now – been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the north-west border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August it would “de-statise” the federal waterways of three major rivers – the Tapajós, Madeira and Tocantins – which is seen as a first step towards their privatisation and transformation into a “hydrovia” water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and non-human residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-Cop30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajós river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people – and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighbouring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, told the Guardian that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden shrivelled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said. “I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatised and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics – and their politically difficult solutions – were not raised during the speeches until the very end of Lula’s visit when the environment minister, Marina Silva, asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they were in the Amazon this month. “Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula – like many world leaders – will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff3fb126efe16c4fcbe1d627a34b454942162e3/261_0_2629_2104/master/2629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93a95f75d05e06959e34d9ac841e6d34",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:12.359826

This month, the global spotlight turns to the environment and our collective efforts to combat climate change as COP30 convenes in Brazil. A decade on from the landmark Paris Agreement, world leaders are gathering to assess progress and chart a path forward to limit and prepare for climate change.

Europe is now warming twice as fast as the global average and the consequences of extreme weather are already being felt, from prolonged periods of water scarcity to increasingly frequent storms and flooding.

Yet, as the latest IPPR poll highlights, the environment doesn’t exist in isolation. While over half of Scots still view climate action as vital to the nation’s future, pressing concerns such as the NHS, cost of living and inequality currently top the public agenda.

Now, more than ever before, it’s important to recognise that the environment is not only at the heart of our identity as a nation but also integral to our success and development. We’re committed to taking action and one of the ways we’re doing this is through the nationally recognised Carbon Literacy Project, a training initiative where we’re equipping colleagues with the knowledge and tools to embed climate-conscious decision-making into everything they do, both at work and at home.

To mark Climate Literacy Action Day, this year taking place to coincide with COP30, we’re hosting staff sessions and expanding accreditation so our people can integrate climate decision-making into all aspects of their roles.

Preparing for a winter of extremes

As we head into another unpredictable winter, the swing between drought and downpour is becoming a familiar pattern. Last winter, some areas were drenched with above-average rainfall, while others saw less than half their usual precipitation.

The message is clear, winter preparedness now means being ready for both water shortages and flooding. With climate change reshaping seasonal norms, resilience depends on acting early, making informed choices, and working together across communities.

And yes, it’s possible to face both flooding and water scarcity at the same time. When heavy rain hits dry ground, it runs off like water on concrete, flooding streets but barely touching river levels. It’s all about timing; scarcity builds slowly, while flooding hits fast.

Prepare and be aware of flooding this winter

As winter approaches, communities across Scotland face an increased risk of flooding brought on by heavy rainfall, saturated ground and extreme weather events.

Flooding can affect you. It might be where you live, or your regular travel routes. Being prepared is key to staying safe and minimising disruption. We’re urging you to take action now to be prepared this winter by taking these easy steps:

Check the Scottish Flood Forecast - This provides a three-day outlook that shows when and where flooding is expected.

Sign up to Floodline - Receive real-time Alerts and Warnings direct by text, phone call or email, allowing you to take action when flooding is expected.

Follow our social media channels - We provide information on predicted flooding in advance through Facebook and X.

Why we need to prepare for water scarcity this winter

Winter is traditionally seen as a time of water abundance, but recent trends tell a different story. In 2024, Scotland experienced a notably dry winter, with many regions recording below-average rainfall. The situation continued into 2025 with record-breaking dry conditions. These repeated dry spells placed sustained pressure on our rivers, keeping them under strain throughout the year.

While rivers are naturally resilient to seasonal fluctuations, prolonged low flows disrupt ecological balance and slow recovery. Consecutive years of reduced flow increase the risk of long-term or even irreversible changes to river ecosystems.

As we enter the winter months, all of Scotland’s rivers have recovered, with all areas at Alert level or below, and all abstraction restrictions lifted across the country.

However, the situation is delicate. That’s why we’re encouraging businesses, especially in agriculture, food production and manufacturing to be ready by integrating climate resilience into their planning.

If you rely on large amounts of water for your business:

Assess your water use - You should review how much water you use and identify areas where consumption can be reduced or recycled.

Engage with SEPA tools and guidance - You can access our water scarcity seasonal reports during the winter months, along with guidance to make informed decisions.

Collaborate locally - Work with suppliers, local authorities and environmental groups to help share resources and strategies.

Latest Scottish household waste statistics highlight progress

Scotland’s latest household waste statistics have revealed a modest rise in recycling rates for 2024. While 44.3% of household waste was successfully recycled, we know that more than half of what ends up in general waste bins, such as food scraps, paper, cardboard and plastics, could have been recycled.

The carbon impact of household waste in 2024 was 5.31 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, marking a 21.5% decrease since 2011. This reduction underscores the environmental benefits of recycling and waste minimisation, especially as Scotland moves toward its goal of a circular economy.

With research showing that over half of general bin contents could be recycled, small changes in household habits, like better sorting and reducing food waste, could significantly boost recycling rates and cut emissions. Every effort counts in supporting Scotland’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Celebration or contamination? What bonfire night means for air quality

Across the country this week, skies have been lit with fireworks and bonfires as communities gathered for a night of sparkle and celebration. But while we enjoyed the show, it’s worth remembering that these fiery festivities come with a few hidden extras, especially for the air we breathe.

As the bonfires blaze and fireworks bang, they release tiny particles into the air, such as soot (black carbon) and colourful metal compounds like lead, copper and barium. These are what give fireworks their dazzling colours and crackling sounds, but they also contribute to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), which can hang around in the air and irritate our lungs.

In previous years, our air quality monitors have picked up noticeable spikes in PM2.5 across Scotland between 5p.m. and 9p.m, right when the celebrations are in full swing. The levels didn’t last long, but they’re usually some of the highest of the week, showing just how much one night of fun can impact the air around us.

Explore the impact our daily lives can have on local air quality by having a look at some data collected during a citizen science project in Stirlingshire. This includes data from Aberfoyle’s bonfire night celebrations.

Extending the life of our assets to support net zero

As part of our ongoing efforts to modernise and reshape our workspaces, we’ll soon be co-locating with Zero Waste Scotland and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland in Stirling city centre. This move supports our net zero ambitions by promoting more sustainable travel, collaborative working and efficient use of shared resources.

Clearing our existing Stirling workspace became a practical demonstration of sustainability in action. Faced with vacating the space, we collaborated to repurpose surplus furniture and IT equipment. Extending the life of our assets has reduced waste and redistributed resources to support colleagues and communities. This approach helped cut emissions, avoid unnecessary procurement, and showed how smarter use of public sector assets delivers real environmental and social value.

A new era of environmental regulation

Water, waste management and industrial activities have now joined radioactive substances in being regulated under the Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (EASR).

The changes introduce a streamlined environmental regulatory framework and marks a major change in how we authorise and regulate activities. This integrated approach is designed to ensure efficient, effective and consistent regulation while reducing and simplifying the regulatory burden for organisations and businesses.

Growing through change - new climate resilience guidance for Scotland’s horticulture sector

The horticulture sector is increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. From shifting rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, to more frequent extreme weather events, these changes pose significant risks to plant health, supply chains and day-to-day operations.

Through our regulatory expertise, environmental data and collaborative partnerships, we support growers, landscapers and suppliers in understanding and adapting to these evolving climate challenges.

To further strengthen the sector’s resilience, Adaptation Scotland and the Horticultural Trades Association have developed new guidance tailored to Scotland’s horticultural industry. This resource identifies the key climate risks and provides practical, actionable steps to help businesses prepare and adapt.

Whether you're a grower, landscaper or supplier, the guide offers strategies already being adopted across Scotland, such as diversifying crops, enhancing drainage systems and rethinking business models, to build long-term resilience and sustainability in the face of a changing climate.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFkkpdUJJ2QdA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4EZpYvq5KHcAM-/0/1762425485366?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2hGzOn-22oY9SVEk0htE4xf5UYpbH_nuXRMoTqjCy8k,N,,2025-11-08 17:02:53.125565

""It's essentially a hoax. It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,"" Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit ""just to try to deliver some common sense.""

Wright's comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration's rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, the White House said Friday.

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a ""moral failure"" to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

""Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,"" Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. ""What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.""

Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump's absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

""President Trump told me he doesn't believe in green energy,"" Lula told reporters earlier this week. ""He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don't have much of an alternative.""

Trump wasn't the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright, a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change, defended Washington's stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

""Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans ... not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,"" he told the AP in Athens. ""They've lost the plot.""

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Trump has reversed Biden's focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. ""energy dominance"" in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future.","It’s true that manufacturing EVs and solar panels currently generates carbon emissions. However, when we look at the full lifecycle — “cradle to grave” — EVs produce significantly less CO2 than gasoline-powered cars. The emissions from a gasoline car are not limited to what comes out of the tailpipe. We must consider the entire “well to wheels” process: drilling for oil, transporting crude, refining it, shipping gasoline to stations, and finally burning it in engines that are only about 30% efficient (70% turned into heat and wasted). Each step adds pollution and greenhouse gases to our environment. This goes on for the entire life of the gasoline-powered car. There is no practical pathway to “carbon-free” with a gasoline car.

For solar panels, emissions are concentrated during manufacturing (mining, refining, panel production). Average carbon payback period is one to four years, meaning they offset their production emissions within that time. After payback, they generate electricity with near-zero emissions for 25-30 years. Another great advantage of rooftop solar is a locked-in price for each and every kilowatt-hour. No worries about inflation, AI and crypto raising the cost of electricity. You can go solar with either a zero-cost power purchase agreement from a company like Atlasta Solar or by purchasing solar panels outright at a reduced cost through a co-op like Solar United Neighbors.

Back to EVs; even though tailpipe emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles are often invisible, they contain a potent mix of harmful pollutants that can make us sick. These include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, fine particulates, and unburned hydrocarbons like benzene and formaldehyde — both known carcinogens. Despite their invisibility, these compounds contribute to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and long-term environmental damage, silently affecting the air we breathe and the health of our communities. You also subject yourself to a cocktail of chemicals every time you pump gas. Some benign, some not so much. Let’s not forget that medicine itself is a major consumer of single-use plastics, so anything that lowers our need for health care also helps reduce waste, pollution and energy consumption.

Financially, EVs are much cheaper to operate. The lifetime cost of driving on electricity is far lower than buying gasoline, especially as global instability affects oil prices. Routine maintenance is also less expensive, since EVs have fewer moving parts and don’t require oil changes. Consider the cost of driving 10,000 miles. A gasoline car getting 20 mpg will consume 500 gallons of gasoline to go that far. Assuming a low price of $5 per gallon this would take $2,500 out of your pocket. An EV consuming 30 kWhs to drive 100 miles would consume 3,000 kWhs. At offpeak Xcel rates of 8.5 cents per kWh, this would take $255 out of your pocket. Less if you have rooftop solar. Driving a gas car could easily have fuel costs more than 10 times as much as an EV charged at home. More than 80% of EV charging is done at home. We charge 100% at home. But what the heck! You don’t mind working part time for the oil oligarchs, do you.

Envision an electrified future where all manufacturing and transportation does not create carbon dioxide and all people are freed from the tyranny of oil. If a war breaks out in the Middle East, gasoline could easily hit $10 per gallon or higher and there’s nothing you can do about it. Meanwhile, the cost of driving electric will be virtually unchanged, especially if you make your own ‘fuel’ on your roof. Your choice.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future. Investing in clean energy isn’t just affordable — it’s the key to securing America’s prosperity and leadership for generations to come.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors.","Understanding Beijing's Strategic Mineral Restrictions

China's rare earth export controls represent a sophisticated regulatory framework that transforms critical minerals from market commodities into strategic diplomatic leverage. The licensing mechanism, administered through China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), establishes government oversight over materials essential to modern technology manufacturing.

The Foundation of Modern Export Control Policy

The current licensing system emerged from decades of policy evolution, moving from open market competition toward strategic resource management. MOFCOM's authority stems from China's foreign trade law framework, enabling rapid implementation of export restrictions across defined material categories. As of November 2025, the ministry had issued 62 regulatory announcements pertaining to export controls, with specific announcements suspended until November 2026 according to official statements.

Furthermore, the distinction between temporary suspensions and permanent policy changes proves critical for understanding Beijing's approach. The November 7, 2025 announcement suspended Announcements 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, and 62 until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year pause with automatic reinstatement provisions. This structure maintains regulatory pressure while providing diplomatic flexibility.

Critical Materials Under Regulatory Oversight

China's export control framework targets both raw materials and processing equipment across the rare earth supply chain. Heavy rare earth elements including dysprosium and terbium face licensing requirements due to their irreplaceable role in high-temperature magnetic applications. These materials enable electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators to maintain performance under thermal stress conditions.

Light rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium also require export licenses, affecting the foundation of permanent magnet production globally. Consequently, the regulatory scope extends beyond raw materials to include processing equipment, creating vertical control across multiple supply chain stages. This comprehensive approach prevents circumvention through alternative processing routes.

Downstream products affected by the controls include finished magnets, catalysts, and technology components incorporating rare earth materials. The licensing requirements create compounding restrictions as materials progress through manufacturing stages, amplifying supply chain complexity for international manufacturers.

How China's 2025 Export Controls Actually Unfolded

Timeline of Regulatory Tightening and Market Response

The implementation of China's rare earth export controls during 2025 followed a calculated escalation pattern, creating maximum market disruption while maintaining policy flexibility. Each phase introduced new restrictions while building upon existing regulatory infrastructure alongside emerging critical minerals strategy initiatives.

April 2025: The Initial Shock Wave

Seven rare earth elements were placed under licensing requirements in April 2025, triggering immediate supply chain disruptions across critical technology sectors. Chinese magnet exports experienced a 50% decline within the first month as exporters struggled to navigate new permit requirements according to Reuters reporting.

The automotive sector faced particularly acute pressure, with portions of the global auto industry approaching shutdown conditions by May 2025 due to magnet shortages. This three-to-four week lag between regulatory implementation and critical supply failure demonstrated the fragility of just-in-time manufacturing systems dependent on Chinese rare earth materials.

Additionally, export license application backlogs developed rapidly, with over 2,000 applications from European Union companies alone by November 2025. The approval process proved complex and time-consuming, requiring multi-hundred page documentation packages and end-use justifications submitted to multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Market reactions were swift and substantial. Praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices surged approximately 40% year-to-date through November 2025, with an additional 14% weekly spike occurring during peak supply uncertainty. These price movements demonstrated the direct correlation between regulatory announcements and rare earth commodity valuations.

October 2025: Extraterritorial Expansion

China expanded its export control scope in October 2025, adding five additional rare earth elements to the controlled substances list. More significantly, Beijing introduced a foreign direct product rule for rare earth materials, establishing a 50% ownership threshold for export license determinations.

This extraterritorial provision extended compliance requirements beyond Chinese borders to international companies with partial Chinese ownership or significant supply chain involvement. However, the 50% threshold created immediate complications for joint ventures and companies with Chinese investment partners, forcing restructuring of ownership arrangements to maintain material access.

The October measures also targeted rare earth processing equipment separately from raw materials, suggesting a deliberate strategy to control both primary production inputs and intermediate processing capabilities. This vertical approach created multiple control points across the supply chain rather than focusing solely on finished goods.

November 2025: The Misunderstood ""Rollback""

The November 7, 2025 MOFCOM announcement created significant confusion in Western media and markets, with many characterising the move as a policy rollback rather than a temporary suspension. The official statement suspended specific announcements until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year window with automatic reinstatement provisions.

Crucially, the core licensing infrastructure remained fully operational despite the suspension of select October announcements. Export license applications continued requiring extensive documentation and multi-agency approval processes, maintaining bureaucratic friction regardless of suspended announcement numbers.

Western media mischaracterisation of the announcement as effectively ending rare earth controls glossed over the technical distinction between suspending specific measures and eliminating the licensing requirement framework entirely. The White House description of the moves proved overly optimistic compared to the actual policy language and implementation reality according to analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

Bureaucratic delays persisted despite suspension headlines, with approval rates varying significantly based on end-use applications. Defense-related applications continued experiencing rejection rates approaching 80%, while commercial applications achieved approximately 50% approval rates through November 2025.

China's Strategic Dominance in Rare Earth Markets

Market Control Statistics and Geopolitical Leverage

China's position in global rare earth markets extends far beyond simple production statistics, creating a comprehensive dominance structure that spans extraction, processing, and manufacturing capabilities. This vertical integration provides Beijing with multiple leverage points across critical technology supply chains.

Production and Processing Monopoly

China controls approximately 60% of global rare earth extraction operations, but this figure understates the true extent of strategic dominance. More critically, China processes 85-90% of refined rare earth oxides globally, creating an essential chokepoint regardless of where initial mining occurs.

The processing monopoly proves particularly significant because rare earth ores require complex chemical separation and purification procedures before use in technology applications. Alternative mining operations outside China often depend on Chinese processing facilities to create usable materials, maintaining Beijing's leverage even over non-Chinese mineral sources.

Magnet manufacturing represents China's most concentrated advantage, with approximately 90% of high-performance permanent magnets produced within Chinese facilities. This downstream integration ensures that even if alternative rare earth sources develop, the critical manufacturing capacity remains under Chinese control.

Economic Impact Across Critical Industries

The scope of China's rare earth influence extends across multiple technology sectors with varying dependency levels and supply risk profiles:

Sector Dependency Level Key Applications Supply Risk Electric Vehicles Critical Motor magnets, batteries High Wind Energy Essential Generator magnets High Defense Systems Strategic Guidance systems, electronics Critical Consumer Electronics Moderate Speakers, hard drives Medium

Electric vehicle manufacturers face critical dependency on Chinese rare earth supplies for motor magnet production, with no viable short-term alternatives for high-performance applications. Wind energy sector dependency proves essential for generator efficiency, while defence systems require strategic materials for guidance and electronic systems.

Chokepoint Analysis for Global Supply Chains

Single points of failure characterise the rare earth supply chain, with Chinese processing capacity representing the most significant vulnerability. Lead times have extended from typical weeks to months as licensing requirements create additional delays and uncertainty.

Price volatility demonstrates direct correlation with Chinese regulatory announcements, as evidenced by the 40% year-to-date increase in praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices through November 2025. This price sensitivity reflects the lack of alternative suppliers capable of meeting global demand at scale.

Alternative supplier capacity gaps remain substantial, with non-Chinese sources unable to replace Chinese production volumes within reasonable timeframes. Timeline projections for meaningful supply chain diversification extend 5-10 years minimum for most critical applications, maintaining Chinese leverage throughout the transition period.

Heavy Rare Earth Elements: Maximum Vulnerability

Strategic Importance of Dysprosium and Terbium

Heavy rare earth elements occupy a unique position in the critical materials landscape due to their irreplaceable performance characteristics and extreme geographic concentration. Unlike light rare earth elements where some substitution pathways exist, dysprosium and terbium provide essential properties for high-temperature applications with no current alternatives.

High-Temperature Performance Requirements

Motor efficiency in electric vehicles depends on dysprosium addition to prevent thermal demagnetisation above specific temperature thresholds. High-performance and military vehicle applications require mission-critical reliability across wide temperature ranges, making dysprosium essential for maintaining magnetic properties under extreme thermal stress.

Wind turbine generator reliability in harsh environments demands terbium addition to maintain magnetic stability during thermal cycling conditions created by intermittent power generation and mechanical stress. Modern permanent magnet generators cannot achieve required efficiency and durability specifications without heavy rare earth enhancement.

Military applications requiring temperature stability in guidance systems and electronics represent strategic end-uses where performance degradation poses mission-critical risks. These defence applications experience rejection rates approaching 80% for Chinese export license applications, demonstrating Beijing's strategic prioritisation of supply restrictions to military sectors.

Geographic Concentration Risks

Southern China clay deposits serve as the primary global source for heavy rare earth elements, creating extreme geographic concentration risk. These deposits, located primarily in ionic clay formations, contain the highest concentrations of dysprosium and terbium accessible through current extraction technologies.

Myanmar border region instability affects supply routes and alternative sourcing options, compounding the geographic concentration problem. Political tensions and infrastructure limitations in border areas create additional supply chain vulnerabilities beyond Chinese regulatory controls.

Furthermore, limited viable alternative deposits outside Chinese territorial control constrain diversification efforts. While heavy rare earth elements exist in other global locations, the concentrations and extraction economics prove significantly less favourable than Chinese sources, limiting practical substitution potential.

Processing technology barriers prevent non-Chinese producers from achieving equivalent separation and purification capabilities. The complex chemistry required for heavy rare earth processing remains concentrated within Chinese facilities, creating additional dependency beyond raw material extraction.

Industry Adaptation Strategies and Engineering Solutions

HREE-Free Magnet Innovations

Engineering teams across multiple industries have accelerated development of heavy rare earth-free solutions in response to supply chain uncertainties. These innovations focus on achieving equivalent performance through design modifications and alternative material compositions rather than depending on scarce dysprosium and terbium supplies.

Engineering Solutions and Supply Chain Diversification

N45SH and N48SH magnet grades have achieved high performance benchmarks entirely without dysprosium addition, representing significant technological progress in HREE-free manufacturing. The N48SH grade reportedly under development promises even higher performance specifications while maintaining independence from heavy rare earth supplies.

Laminated magnet designs reduce heat-related demagnetisation through improved thermal management, lessening dependency on dysprosium's high-temperature properties. These segmented architectures distribute thermal stress more effectively, enabling HREE-free magnets to achieve performance levels previously requiring heavy rare earth enhancement.

Grain boundary diffusion techniques enhance coercivity in light rare earth magnets, providing alternative pathways to high-temperature performance. Advanced processing methods enable optimisation of magnetic properties without requiring scarce heavy rare earth additions.

In addition, cerium-based alloy research explores lighter rare earth substitutes for traditional heavy rare earth applications. These investigations focus on abundant light rare earth elements that could replace dysprosium and terbium in specific applications while maintaining required performance characteristics.

Design Engineering Workarounds

Innovation Spotlight: Automotive engineers are implementing segmented magnet architectures and advanced cooling systems to maintain motor performance while reducing dependency on temperature-resistant heavy rare earths.

Motor design modifications include larger magnet volumes and improved cooling systems to achieve equivalent performance without heavy rare earth enhancement. These engineering approaches trade material scarcity for design complexity, enabling continued production despite supply constraints.

Laminated stacks and advanced motor controls provide additional pathways for maintaining efficiency while reducing rare earth dependency. These system-level solutions optimise overall performance through intelligent design rather than relying solely on material properties.

Alternative Supply Chain Development

Government investment in domestic rare earth capacity has accelerated significantly during 2025, with the US Department of Defense allocating $400 million toward domestic production capabilities. This represents substantial federal commitment to supply chain resilience alongside the executive order on minerals initiatives, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years.

Australian rare earth projects are ramping production capacity to provide alternatives to Chinese sources, though processing capabilities remain limited. Projects including Lynas Corporation and emerging producers aim to establish integrated supply chains independent of Chinese processing infrastructure.

Canadian processing facilities target 2026-2027 operational dates, representing potential diversification opportunities for North American manufacturers. These developments focus on establishing domestic processing capabilities rather than depending on Chinese separation and purification facilities.

European Union critical materials stockpiling initiatives aim to create strategic reserves for supply disruption scenarios. These government-led programmes prioritise building buffer inventories of essential materials while longer-term diversification efforts develop capacity.

Export License Requirements: Practical Business Impact

Compliance Challenges and Market Friction

The licensing requirement framework creates substantial operational complexity for global manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies. Application processes involve extensive documentation, multi-agency coordination, and unpredictable approval timelines that fundamentally alter supply chain planning approaches.

Application Process Complexity

Multi-hundred page documentation requirements characterise export license applications, demanding detailed technical specifications, end-use justifications, and supply chain transparency. Companies must provide comprehensive product descriptions, importing entity verification, and strategic use attestations across multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Processing timeframes extend 3-6 months minimum for standard applications, with defence-related applications experiencing significantly longer delays or outright rejections. The approval process involves coordination between MOFCOM, customs authorities, and security agencies, creating multiple points where applications may encounter delays or denials.

End-use justification requirements force companies to provide detailed explanations of intended applications, creating transparency demands that may compromise competitive information. Manufacturers must balance regulatory compliance with protection of proprietary product development information.

Rejection rates for defence-related applications approach 80%, creating effective embargoes on Chinese rare earth supplies for military applications. This selective approval process enables China to maintain commercial relationships while restricting strategic end-uses.

Operational Impact on Global Manufacturers

Just-in-time inventory models have become obsolete for manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies, forcing fundamental changes to working capital and storage requirements. Companies have shifted toward maintaining substantial buffer inventories to accommodate licensing delays and approval uncertainties.

Safety stock requirements have increased 300-500% compared to pre-control inventory levels, representing substantial working capital impacts for affected manufacturers. This inventory expansion reflects the need to maintain production continuity despite unpredictable supply chain disruptions.

Supplier qualification processes now extend beyond technical specifications to include regulatory compliance capabilities and licensing track records. Manufacturers must evaluate suppliers based on their ability to navigate Chinese export control requirements successfully rather than focusing solely on cost and quality metrics.

Contract terms increasingly incorporate regulatory change clauses to address the possibility of sudden policy modifications. These provisions attempt to allocate risk between parties for scenarios involving unexpected export control modifications or licensing delays.

Financial Implications for Supply Chain Planning

Price premiums for non-Chinese rare earth sources range 15-25% above Chinese rates, reflecting scarcity value and alternative supplier capacity constraints. These premiums represent structural cost increases that affect manufacturing economics across rare earth-dependent industries.

Working capital increases result from extended lead times and higher inventory requirements, creating financing pressures for manufacturers adapting to new supply chain realities. Companies must secure additional financing to accommodate longer cash conversion cycles and higher safety stock levels.

However, currency hedging complexity increases with multi-jurisdiction sourcing strategies designed to reduce Chinese dependency. Manufacturers must manage foreign exchange exposure across multiple currencies and longer time horizons than traditional supply arrangements required.

Insurance costs for supply chain disruption coverage have risen substantially as insurers recognise the systemic risks created by rare earth export controls. Premium increases reflect the concentrated nature of rare earth supply chains and the potential for sudden regulatory changes.

Diversification Progress and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Production Capacity Development Outside China

Global efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supplies have accelerated significantly, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years and involve substantial capital requirements. Current progress demonstrates both promise and limitations in achieving supply chain independence, particularly given the broader defense materials strategy considerations.

Progress Assessment and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Region Current Capacity 2027 Projections Key Projects Australia 15% of global 25% of global Lynas, Iluka Resources North America 5% of global 12% of global MP Materials, Ucore Europe 2% of global 8% of global REE processing partnerships

Australian production capacity represents the most advanced alternative to Chinese sources, with Lynas Corporation operating integrated mining and processing facilities. However, downstream processing for speciality applications remains limited compared to Chinese capabilities, constraining substitution potential for high-performance applications.

North American capacity development focuses on domestic supply chain security, with MP Materials expanding production at Mountain Pass and other companies developing processing capabilities. Government support through defence department contracts provides revenue certainty for capacity investment decisions.

European initiatives emphasise processing partnerships and strategic material stockpiling rather than domestic mining operations. The European Union's critical materials strategy prioritises reducing processing dependence through technology partnerships and supply chain diversification agreements.

Technology Transfer and Processing Capabilities

Separation technology licensing agreements with Chinese firms create potential vulnerabilities in diversification strategies, as technology access depends on maintaining positive relationships with Chinese partners. These arrangements may face restrictions during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.

Independent processing development timelines require 5-7 years minimum to achieve commercial-scale operations, reflecting the technical complexity of rare earth separation and purification processes. Environmental permitting challenges in Western jurisdictions add additional time and uncertainty to project development schedules.

Capital requirements exceeding $1 billion characterise integrated rare earth processing facilities capable of competing with Chinese operations. These substantial investment thresholds limit the number of viable projects and extend development timelines as companies secure financing.

Environmental compliance costs in developed countries create structural disadvantages compared to Chinese operations, affecting long-term competitiveness of alternative suppliers. Regulatory requirements for waste management and environmental protection add operational costs that must be recovered through higher prices.

Market Reality Check on Supply Security

Non-Chinese capacity remains insufficient for complete substitution through 2030, maintaining structural dependence on Chinese supplies for most applications. Even aggressive capacity development scenarios leave significant supply gaps that require continued Chinese sourcing for global demand fulfilment.

Quality specifications for premium applications often require Chinese processing capabilities, limiting substitution potential even when alternative raw materials become available. The precision and consistency achieved by Chinese processing facilities proves difficult to replicate in new operations.

Cost competitiveness gaps persist despite geopolitical risk premiums, as Chinese operations benefit from scale economies and integrated supply chains. Alternative suppliers must achieve substantial scale before achieving cost parity with Chinese producers, extending the timeline for meaningful competition.

Strategic stockpile adequacy provides only 3-6 months maximum buffer for most countries, insufficient to weather extended supply disruptions or allow time for alternative capacity development. Government reserves focus on emergency preparedness rather than long-term supply independence.

Strategic Planning for Regulatory Uncertainty

Investment Implications and Long-term Outlook

The rare earth export control environment has fundamentally altered investment and strategic planning assumptions across technology sectors. Regulatory volatility represents the new baseline condition rather than temporary disruption, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing uncertainty, particularly given recent developments in US minerals deal negotiations.

Policy Volatility as the New Normal

Export control frameworks enable rapid implementation of new restrictions without extended notification periods, creating permanent uncertainty for supply chain planning. The November 2025 suspension demonstrates how quickly policy conditions can change while maintaining underlying control infrastructure.

Suspension agreements remain subject to geopolitical relationship changes, with automatic reinstatement provisions ensuring that controls can resume without new regulatory processes. This structure maintains compliance pressure even during periods of apparent policy relaxation.

License approval rates correlate directly with diplomatic tensions between China and importing countries, creating additional unpredictability beyond technical application requirements. Companies must monitor geopolitical relationships as carefully as supply chain logistics when planning rare earth sourcing strategies.

Regulatory arbitrage opportunities continue diminishing over time as China expands control scope and international coordination increases. The extraterritorial provisions introduced in October 2025 demonstrate Beijing's willingness to extend controls beyond direct bilateral relationships.

Investment Implications for Critical Materials Sector

Rare earth mining equities have experienced 40-60% volatility ranges during 2025, reflecting investor uncertainty regarding supply chain developments and regulatory changes. Price movements correlate strongly with policy announcements rather than fundamental supply and demand factors.

Processing technology companies command premium valuations as investors recognise the strategic value of separation and purification capabilities. Companies with proven rare earth processing expertise benefit from scarcity value as alternatives to Chinese facilities gain importance.

Recycling and urban mining ventures attract strategic investment as manufacturers seek to reduce dependence on primary rare earth sources. These circular economy approaches offer potential supply chain independence while addressing environmental sustainability concerns.

Defence contractors prioritise supply chain resilience over cost optimisation, creating premium markets for non-Chinese rare earth sources. Government procurement preferences for domestic or allied suppliers support higher pricing for secure supply arrangements.

Long-term Strategic Considerations

Market Reality: While engineering innovations and alternative suppliers are developing rapidly, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, making adaptive strategies more valuable than absolute solutions.

Technology evolution may reduce rare earth dependency over the long term through materials science advances and design optimisation. However, current applications in electric vehicles, wind energy, and defence systems continue requiring rare earth materials with no immediate substitutes available.

Geopolitical relationships will significantly influence the pace and direction of supply chain diversification efforts. Improved diplomatic relationships could reduce incentives for alternative supplier development, while continued tensions would accelerate diversification investments.

Economic competitiveness of alternative sources depends on achieving sufficient scale to compete with Chinese cost structures. Success requires sustained investment and market support during extended development periods when alternative suppliers operate at cost disadvantages.

Strategic stockpiling provides short-term supply security but cannot replace the need for sustainable long-term supply chain development. Government reserves serve emergency preparedness functions while industry develops alternative capacity and supply arrangements.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets

China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors. The November 2025 suspension of select export control announcements demonstrates regulatory flexibility while maintaining structural control over essential materials according to analysis by the International Energy Agency.

The distinction between temporary policy adjustments and permanent strategic reversals proves critical for business planning and investment decisions. Beijing's approach maintains comprehensive leverage through processing capacity dominance and vertical supply chain integration regardless of specific regulatory announcements.

Industry adaptation through engineering innovation and alternative supplier development represents the most promising pathway toward supply chain resilience. HREE-free magnet technologies and diversified processing capacity reduce dependency on Chinese supplies while maintaining performance requirements.

However, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Success depends on balancing immediate supply needs with long-term diversification investments while managing the financial and operational impacts of extended transition timelines.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.tristatehomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/92/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-08 11:06:05.797898

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian.
EVXL’s Take This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history.","Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented $1 trillion compensation package, potentially making him the world’s first trillionaire—despite collapsing European sales, mounting brand damage from political controversies, and serious questions about whether the world’s largest executive pay package will solve any of Tesla’s actual business problems.

The vote passed with more than 75% approval at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, according to NBC News. The timing couldn’t be more striking: shareholders approved the package on the same day Tesla’s October European sales data revealed catastrophic declines across nearly every major market, with registrations plummeting by double digits in key countries including Germany, Sweden, and Denmark.

Largest Corporate Compensation Package In History

The approved package would grant Musk up to 423.7 million additional Tesla shares over the next decade if he achieves extraordinarily ambitious targets, according to CNBC. Those milestones include growing Tesla’s market capitalization from approximately $1.4 trillion today to $8.5 trillion, expanding annual adjusted profit from current levels to $400 billion, delivering 20 million vehicles cumulatively, deploying 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and producing 1 million Optimus humanoid robots and 1 million robotaxis.

Musk currently owns roughly 12.5% of Tesla worth approximately $461 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth of about $473 billion according to Bloomberg. If he unlocks the full compensation package, his stake would increase to approximately 27% of the company.

“I super appreciate it. Thank you, everyone,” Musk said after the vote was announced, according to NBC News. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter on the future of Tesla but a whole new book.”

After the announcement, Musk celebrated on stage at the shareholder meeting, dancing and laughing alongside a pair of Optimus robots.

The Vote Nobody Expected To Be Close

The compensation package was expected to pass, with betting markets giving it 93% odds of approval on Wednesday, according to NBC News. Tesla introduced the pay plan in September 2025, with Board Chair Robyn Denholm warning shareholders in late October that rejecting it could trigger Musk’s departure and send the company’s value into freefall.

Major proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about the total size of the award, shareholder dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Tesla’s sixth-largest external investor, also voted against the plan.

“While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk—consistent with our views on executive compensation,” Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement reported by Fox Business.

Glass Lewis estimated that the entire S&P 500 combined paid all its CEOs about $9 billion last year, according to NPR. Using even conservative valuations, Musk’s package works out to roughly $88 billion over ten years, or $8.8 billion annually—nearly as much as every other major corporate CEO combined, before factoring in potential stock growth.

The Timing: European Sales Collapse On Vote Day

The shareholder vote occurred on the same day EVXL reported that Tesla’s October 2025 sales had collapsed across Europe. New vehicle registrations plummeted by double-digit margins in nearly every major market, with Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, and Germany down 54% compared to the previous year.

The European sales crisis stems from three interconnected problems: stale product lineup, brand damage from Musk’s political activities, and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD. While Tesla sales crater, BYD’s European registrations surged 272% year-over-year in recent months.

In the United States, Tesla faces a different but equally serious challenge. The September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit—eliminated through President Trump’s legislative package—has sent the broader EV market into freefall. U.S. motor vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units in October, with electric vehicle sales dropping 24% in just one month.

Tesla managed to avoid the immediate impact by reporting record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles—crushing Wall Street estimates of 447,000—as buyers rushed to purchase before the tax credit expired, according to Yahoo Finance. But that artificial spike pulled demand forward from future quarters, setting up what analysts warn will be a challenging fourth quarter and beyond.

The Robot Army And Control Concerns

Musk has repeatedly stated that the compensation package is less about money and more about maintaining control over Tesla and its future products, particularly the Optimus humanoid robot program.

“If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? That’s my biggest concern,” Musk said in an October webcast with Wall Street analysts reported by NBC News. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm echoed this sentiment in recent interviews. “It’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence,” she told CNBC.

The targets tied to the compensation package include delivering 1 million Optimus robots and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. Neither product is anywhere near commercial reality—Tesla’s robotaxi service launched in Austin with just 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers, and the Optimus robot remains in prototype stage with basic functionality challenges.

Why Investors Stuck With Musk Despite Everything

The shareholder vote represents a remarkable show of confidence in Musk despite significant brand damage throughout 2025. Tesla’s association with political controversies—including Musk’s work in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency and his support for far-right political groups in Europe—has alienated left-leaning consumers who historically formed the core EV buyer demographic.

French Tesla owners filed a lawsuit in June 2025 citing Musk’s political stances as damaging their peaceful use of their vehicles, with some owners reporting vandalism including swastikas painted on their cars. France saw Tesla sales drop 67% year-over-year in May 2024 following Musk’s political activities.

Yet Tesla’s stock has surged approximately two-thirds since May 2025, when Musk announced he was leaving the Trump administration, according to The Guardian. The stock rally reflects investor optimism about Tesla’s artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions, with analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities estimating Tesla’s AI-driven self-driving portfolio could be worth nearly $1 trillion alone.

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”

Another factor is the culture among U.S. investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged, and Jeff Bezos enjoyed a long reign at Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Most Tesla shareholders seemed more concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company rather than wanting him to leave altogether.

“Money talks in the US more,” Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets, told The Guardian. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”

The Disconnect Between Compensation And Business Reality

Critics argue the compensation vote reveals a fundamental disconnect between shareholder sentiment and Tesla’s actual business performance. The company faces declining deliveries, shrinking market share, and profit pressures largely attributed to Musk’s behavior driving customers away.

“He has hundreds of billions of dollars already in the company, and to say that he won’t stay without a trillion is ridiculous,” Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at research firm Telemetry who has covered Tesla for nearly two decades, told Euronews. “It’s absurd that shareholders think he is worth this much.”

Shareholder advocate James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, opposed the plan due to concerns about demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits.

“Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,” McRitchie told CNBC. “There’s a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.”

The compensation package requires Tesla to increase its market cap nearly sixfold to $8.5 trillion—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while delivering more than double the number of vehicles it has sold since the company’s founding. Achieving those targets while Chinese manufacturers like BYD aggressively expand globally and traditional automakers scale back EV investments presents extraordinary challenges.

EVXL’s Take

This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history. Shareholders just approved paying Musk nearly a trillion dollars based on hitting science-fiction targets—1 million robots, 1 million robotaxis, an $8.5 trillion valuation—while the core automotive business that generates virtually all of Tesla’s revenue is hemorrhaging customers in Europe and facing a post-tax-credit demand cliff in America.

We’ve been tracking this story closely. Back in late October, Board Chair Robyn Denholm issued an urgent warning that Tesla could collapse into “just another car company” without this compensation package. But here’s the fundamental problem with that framing: if only Musk can save Tesla, why is Tesla dying under his leadership?

European sales data published the very day of the shareholder vote showed catastrophic declines—Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, Germany down 54%. These aren’t just bad numbers; they represent a structural collapse driven by three factors that paying Musk more won’t fix: stale products, brand damage from his political activities, and brutal competition from Chinese manufacturers offering better technology at lower prices.

The compensation targets assume Tesla can grow from $1.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion in market cap—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while simultaneously delivering 20 million vehicles. For context, Tesla has delivered roughly 8 million vehicles total since its founding. The plan requires more than doubling that in just ten years while losing market share in Europe and navigating a U.S. market where federal EV tax credits expired September 30.

We predicted this would happen. When federal EV tax credits ended, we warned of demand collapse. It arrived right on schedule—U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month. Tesla’s Q3 record deliveries were artificially inflated by customers rushing to beat the September 30 deadline, pulling forward demand that would have occurred in Q4 and beyond.

The robotaxi and Optimus robot targets sound ambitious, but they’re nowhere near commercial reality. Tesla’s Austin robotaxi pilot operates with 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers. The Optimus robot remains a prototype with basic functionality challenges. These aren’t realistic near-term business lines—they’re speculative moonshots that shareholders just agreed to pay for in advance with the largest compensation package in corporate history.

What Tesla actually needs isn’t a bigger carrot for Musk—it’s a fundamental strategic refocus on the automotive business. That means accelerating affordable model launches, meaningfully refreshing the Model 3 and Model Y with competitive technology, pricing aggressively to compete with Chinese manufacturers, and rebuilding brand reputation in Europe through both product excellence and, frankly, keeping the CEO out of divisive political controversies that alienate core customers.

The vote passed with 75% approval, but remember the context: Norway’s $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund voted against it. Glass Lewis and ISS—the two largest proxy advisory firms—recommended rejection. The opposition came from sophisticated institutional investors focused on fundamentals, while approval came largely from retail shareholders betting on Musk’s vision regardless of current business reality.

This story connects directly to our extensive coverage of Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s retreat from Delaware to Texas to avoid shareholder accountability, and the broader industry collapse following tax credit expiration that’s now claiming thousands of jobs at GM, Rivian, and across the supply chain.

The compensation package essentially asks: should we reward spectacular failure and brand damage with nearly a trillion dollars based on achieving targets that require Tesla to become larger than Apple and Microsoft combined? Shareholders answered yes. Whether that bet pays off or becomes the most expensive corporate mistake in history remains to be seen.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","(The Hill) – In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-08 12:05:38.063127

They have done huge investment in the whole battery supply chain over decades and giving know-how to other countries like India can shift the market dynamics soon.
Given that these are not export prohibitions but license mandates, why should the move be a cause of concern for the global battery companies?","China has announced new export controls that will take effect on November 8, 2025. Among controlled items are lithium-ion battery cells and battery packs with a gravimetric energy density exceeding 300 Wh/kg, various cathode materials and their precursors, artificial graphite anode materials and related production equipment and technology. This puts the focus on a few companies, like Epsilon Advanced Materials, working to build capacity to deliver battery-grade CAM and anode materials ex-China. Mr Vikram Handa, Managing Director of Epsilon Advanced Materials, shared his views on this development.

Could you please share a brief note on Epsilon Advanced Materials’ current CAM and anode manufacturing capabilities, status, and locations in India and globally?

We commissioned India’s first graphite anode qualification & commercial plant in Bellary, Karnataka, in early 2024. The scale-up facility will produce 30,000 tons by 2027 with 100,000 tons by 2030. We have also received all pre-construction permits for our North Carolina, USA facility with 60,000 tons of graphite anode by 2030.

Our Cathode Technology Centre in Germany is an advanced R&D facility with a 250-ton commercial demonstration plant, the largest LFP cathode facility outside China. This centre holds over 120 patents, and we are developing next-generation cathode materials with advanced cell testing work. In India, we plan to commission the country’s first LFP Cathode Active Material (CAM) manufacturing plant by 2028 with an initial capacity of 30,000 tons, scaling up to 100,000 tons by 2031.

All these plans are to support our mission for the global battery supply chain and contribute to sustainable energy solutions. Both of our anode & cathode material is qualified with cell makers & auto OEMs in India, the US and the EU and we should close on an offtake soon to enable a secure & reliable supply chain outside China.

Many reports say that China controls 99% of the graphite anode market and over 80% of cathode material manufacturing at present. Is that a correct assessment of China’s current control on the battery value chain?

Yes, that’s correct. China has done commendable work in the last 20~25 years in mining, battery material processing & battery manufacturing, hence their dominant position is obvious. We need to learn a lot from China on how the government incentivised everyone to integrate both upstream & downstream so as to create a resilient ecosystem that allowed everyone to thrive not only in the domestic market but has also been enjoying a highly skewed global leadership position.

Their recent export restrictions on battery materials, machinery and its technology is an indicator and explains why business and government needs to build ex-China capacity and supply chain through focused policies. Because a policy, incentive, or subsidy made for cell makers might not work for battery material producers like us. Many companies are now building their capabilities; however, we need binding offtakes & agreements from downstream industry which can make these innovations & investments feasible and practical.

How do you see China’s latest export control announcement involving advanced batteries, production equipment, cathode materials, and artificial graphite anode materials, along with related production equipment and technology?

After the rare earth metal ban, this kind of ban was seen coming. China’s export sanctions safeguard their interest to not let their innovation & technology be sold outside and dilute their market dominance. They have done huge investment in the whole battery supply chain over decades and giving know-how to other countries like India can shift the market dynamics soon.

The restrictions raise concerns for cross-border transfers of high-end battery cells, key upstream inputs, and machines. Operationally, it will compel buyers and OEMs to reassess sourcing risk, accelerate localisation plans, and fast-track qualification of alternative suppliers outside China. In short, it’s a wake-up call that supply-chain resilience is now a front-line commercial priority.

Given that these are not export prohibitions but license mandates, why should the move be a cause of concern for the global battery companies?

License requirements may sound less severe than outright bans, but they materially increase commercial friction and execution risk. Licenses create additional lead times, uncertainty about approvals and the possibility of case-by-case denials or restrictive conditions. For high-volume manufacturing, even short lead-time disruptions can derail project timelines, qualification schedules and finance assumptions. I believe license regimes has unpredictable gating points into a supply chain that until now relied on relatively frictionless cross-border trade and that unpredictability can translate into higher costs, slower ramp-ups and high execution risk for Indian & global battery makers.

Export control also extends to production equipment for CAM and graphite anodes. How do these restrictions impact ex-China CAM and anode manufacturing companies like Epsilon?

For ex-China manufacturers, controls on equipment can raise two operational challenges. Certain downstream lines and high-precision machines sourced from China may now face licensing hurdles or supply delays, which may complicate procurement and commissioning schedules. Also, the transfer of associated technology and know-how may become slower or subject to approvals, which can lengthen qualification cycles.

That said, this also creates an opportunity to invest in non-Chinese equipment suppliers, incentivise partnerships with global OEMs of critical machinery, and increase the commercial value of products from companies like Epsilon that can deliver qualified, locally sourced CAM and anode materials. Practically, companies must diversify equipment suppliers, build strategic inventory buffers for long-lead items, and accelerate local engineering and process development to reduce dependence on any single geography.

What steps does Epsilon plan to take to secure equipment procurement for its facilities, as well as speed up the race to deliver production-ready battery materials on a mass scale?

Our steps are multi-pronged and pragmatic. We are qualifying alternate equipment vendors across India and Japan, so single-source risks are minimised. We are strengthening engineering and machine-integration capabilities locally and forming strategic JV/technology partnerships to internalize critical process steps. Parallel qualification tracks with cell manufacturers (pilot → pre-commercial → commercial) have now shortened via feedback loops, sample exchanges and testing. We are working closely with industry bodies and the government to ensure predictable trade and investment frameworks that support the rapid commercialisation of ex-China supply.

Any other information you would like to share on the subject?

Two closing points from my end. First, the lessons learnt from China’s restrictions must accelerate our energy security and supply-chain resilience for the whole battery value chain and not just procurement checkboxes. Governments, investors and industry must accelerate coordinated action to build local processing, incentivize equipment manufacturing, and expand recycling and secondary-materials ecosystems.

Second, the challenge is surmountable with focused capital, policy support and cross-border partnerships. We must create a diversified, reliable supply chain outside China within the next 3~5 years so that companies like us, who are committed to being part of that solution, can survive & thrive.",https://evreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Evreporter_china-export-curb.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:59.380143
,Congress,2025-11-08 14:02:00+00:00,The Nation,"At COP30, Will Lula Be a Rain Forest Champion? - The Nation","Jonathan Watts, Leah Abrams, Jeet Heer, Steve Brodner, Chris Lehmann, The Nation, Mychal Denzel Smith, www.thenation.com",,,,,https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/lula-brazil-amazon-cop30-climate/,"Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.
Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests.
Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown.
Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress, and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the center left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he made clear that his priority was social development, but he was clear that humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the lost of forests: “I am convinced that, despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need road maps to—in a fair and planned way—reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels, and mobilize the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging, and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates that Brazil’s emissions—which are mainly determined by the health of its forests—have fallen by 16.7 percent, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 group of the world’s 20 biggest economies.

These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5 billion, with investments of $3 billion from Norway, $1 billion each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands, and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilization, water transport, and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, which has seen a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction in the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7 C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rain forest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Ad Policy

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is, get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4 billion years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

But Lula relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swaths of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licenses for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas, off the coast of the rain forest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have—until now—been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the northwest border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August that it would “de-statize” the federal waterways of three major rivers; the Tapajós, Madeira, and Tocantins, which is seen as a first step toward their privatization and transformation into a hydrovia water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and nonhuman residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-COP30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajos river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people—and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighboring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, said that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden had shriveled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said.” I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination, and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatized and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics—and their politically difficult solutions—were not raised during the speeches and glad-handing of Lula’s visit until the very end, when Environment Minister Marina Silva asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they are in the Amazon this month: “COP30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil, and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula—like many world leaders—will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lula-belem-cop30-getty.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:16.656945

A record 117 GW of new wind capacity was added globally in 2023, bringing total cumulative capacity beyond 1,136 GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.
While advanced economies reduced their energy demand, the growth in clean energy could not fully offset the world’s escalating needs.

As a renewable energy source, it is self-replenishing and produces no operational emissions, though the lifecycle of wind turbines presents its own environmental considerations.

The sector is experiencing substantial growth, yet it operates within a complex global energy landscape still wrestling with rising demand and emissions.

A record 117 GW of new wind capacity was added globally in 2023, bringing total cumulative capacity beyond 1,136 GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Despite this growth, overall energy-related CO₂ emissions rose by 0.8% in 2023 to a new high of 37.8Gt CO₂.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) points to increased coal consumption in China, India and Southeast Asia as a primary cause.

While advanced economies reduced their energy demand, the growth in clean energy could not fully offset the world’s escalating needs.

The IEA confirms that accelerating clean energy growth is essential to limit power-sector emissions this decade.

A major hurdle for wind energy is its integration into grids that have historically been built to accommodate fossil fuels. Establishing connections for wind farms is complex, especially for offshore projects that can often be located more than 100km from land.

These distances require long transition lines and development can be slowed by permitting bottlenecks and limited grid capacity.

Furthermore, the variable nature of wind means the energy supply is intermittent. This unpredictability requires other, more constant, energy sources to meet power demand.

To mitigate this, wind power is often combined with other renewables like solar to smooth out the overall energy production curve.

Innovative solutions and project developments

To address intermittency, companies are piloting integrated energy systems.

The Hollandse Kust Noord project in the Netherlands combines offshore wind with floating solar panels, battery storage and offshore hydrogen electrolysis.

The project began operations in December 2023.

Its floating solar array will be situated alongside the turbines to provide a more consistent energy output.

The inclusion of batteries and an on-site hydrogen plant allows for the storage of excess energy generated during periods of high wind and low demand.

Tackling the turbine lifecycle footprint

While wind turbines are clean during operation, their manufacturing, transport and decommissioning have an environmental footprint.

Turbine blades, made from composite materials like fibreglass and resin, are particularly difficult to recycle at their end-of-life.

The industry is actively seeking solutions to this challenge.

The Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany is the first commercial project to use Siemens Gamesa’s RecyclableBlade technology.

This innovation allows for the recovery of blade materials once a turbine is decommissioned.

Marc Becker, CEO of the Siemens Gamesa Offshore Business Unit, says: ""We are proving that as leaders of the offshore revolution, we are committed to making disruptive technology innovation commercially viable with the pace that the climate emergency demands.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/9f9cd6f9117943d66825bb9c951aebc6:9e13bdeead3751ade56d7cfa46d67657/jesse-de-meulenaere-iatiyqrtl8-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 09:18:47.651919

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

It is incredibly disappointing that we are on day thirty-eight of the Democrats’ reckless government shutdown, making it the longest in American history. Senate Democrats have officially voted fifteen times to keep the government closed. I voted weeks ago to fund the government, and have since advocated for reopening it and returning to normal order. This week, I continued delivering that message in Texas-11 and back up in Washington.

Below, you’ll find photos and highlights from the week, plus information on how my office can assist you with any federal concerns. As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best,

REMINDER: Financial Resources for Impacted Individuals

If you or someone you know has been impacted by the government shutdown, financial resources are available. Last month, I held a roundtable in San Angelo with local financial institutions and community organizations, where banks announced 0% interest loans and United Way announced they are providing gift cards, gas cards, energy assistance programs, clothing assistance programs, food assistance programs, and more for those in need. Additionally, the City of San Angelo announced plans to extend bill payments to anyone experiencing financial uncertainty due to the shutdown.

ICYMI: SNAP Resources for Texas-11

3.5 million vulnerable Texans are having their SNAP benefits threatened because Democrats refuse to reopen the government. Today, the Trump administration told states they are working to pay full November food stamp benefits during the government shutdown. While this will alleviate the immediate pain for many families across America, this is only a short-term fix.

Weeks ago, I voted to fund the government, including SNAP, to avoid this very situation. I am infuriated that Democrats continue to put their political agenda before the well-being of Americans in need. I urge Senate Democrats to do the right thing and stop holding the government hostage. In the meantime, please reach out to my office if you are negatively affected by this shutdown and need assistance.

Should you need additional support, our local food banks are here to help:

Concho Valley Regional Food Bank (Coke, Irion, Sterling, Tom Green, Concho, McCulloch, Menard, Mason, and Kimble Counties)

San Angelo Food Bank (Concho, Coke, Irion, Sterling, & Tom Green Counties)

West Texas Food Bank (Ector, Midland, and Glasscock Counties)

West Central Texas Food Bank (Brown, Coleman, & Runnels Counties)

Central Texas Food Bank (Bell, Llano, Lampasas, Mills, and San Saba Counties)

Holding the Line on a Continuing Resolution

As Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest Congressional caucus with 189 Republican members, I joined my fellow RSC leaders to release a statement this week calling for an end to the Democrats’ shutdown through a continuing resolution that funds the government at least into January 2026.

The statement, first covered in Fox News, also urges Congress to reject extending Biden-era COVID subsidies while delivering a health care system for Americans that is truly accessible, affordable, and spurs innovation. Lower health care costs start with fostering competition in the market, and that is exactly what I am advocating for in Congress. Read the full statement and more on our plan to reopen the government and lower healthcare costs for Americans in Fox News by clicking here or the image below.

Mason Town Hall

I had a terrific community town hall in Mason this week. While the Democrats continue with their political theatrics and hold the government hostage, my top priority remains fighting for Texans and providing top-notch constituent services to the incredible men and women I am blessed to represent.

I’m extremely grateful to everyone who came out, and I was honored to recognize the outstanding work of the Mason Junior High Kind Club–a group of exceptional eighth-grade girls who serve as leaders for younger students by modeling acts of kindness and participating in community service projects–for their recent creative pumpkin painting project. This project raised funds for the Mason Cancer Benefit, demonstrating how they put their mission into action.

It’s clubs and students like this who are making real impacts in their communities, and it gives me hope to see young people giving up their time to serve and volunteer for the betterment of those around them.

Standing Up Against Christian Persecution in Nigeria

We must stand against the unjust persecution of Christians in Nigeria who are being brutally murdered simply for their faith. As a Christian myself, this is personal, and I will not stay silent while men, women, and children are targeted for what they believe. This senseless violence must end peacefully.

I joined my colleagues on the Values Action Team (VAT) to commend President Trump’s leadership on this issue and call for the end of Christian persecution in Nigeria. Read more here or by clicking on the image below.

Maria Bartiromo in the Permian Basin

Few places tell the story of American strength quite like the Permian Basin. I was proud to welcome Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business to the heart of West Texas to showcase the region that fuels our country every single day.

From a Diamondback Energy frac site to a Chevron oil rig, Maria saw firsthand the innovation and grit that makes the Permian Basin the largest, safest, and most secure source of oil and gas in the United States. Local energy leaders also delivered a clear message: President Biden’s four-year war on American energy hurt American workers, drove up energy costs, and put a target on the back of the Permian Basin.

During our exclusive interview, I highlighted how the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have fought tirelessly to rebuild a pro-energy framework in government by cutting red tape and putting American producers back in the driver’s seat. But the work is far from over. Permitting reform remains a top priority, and as the representative of America’s energy capital, I plan to lead that charge in Congress once the Democrats quit their political theatrics and open the government.

Like a fish out of water trying to flop its way back to safety, US President Donald Trump has been floundering from one self-made disaster to another. Perhaps a return to his native environment of glitz and ballrooms will soothe his troubled mind. In the meantime, he is faced with the disturbing reality of failure, with the nation’s EV charging station network as Exhibit A.

More EV Charging Stations For The US

To be clear, Trump has achieved some notable, if temporary, successes. For example, thousands of working households lost their jobs after the president almost snuffed out the entire domestic offshore wind industry. And, EV sales fell off a cliff in October after Trump’s Republican allies in Congress passed a new tax bill that eliminated the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30.

Still, the wind will continue blowing long after Trump leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. The case for vehicle electrification is also not going anywhere anytime soon. While US automakers are retrenching their EV manufacturing plans for the time being, signs of recovery are also evident in the rapid uptick of EV charging station activity this year.

One newly emerging factor consists of new financial models that make installing new EV charging stations a hassle-free experience for tenant-occupied commercial and residential properties. The overwhelming majority of EV owners prefer the convenience of charging where they live, and now that option is being opened up to millions more prospective EV buyers.

Another factor is the rising competition among quick-serve restaurants, travel centers, and convenience stores seeking to attract EV drivers. The space of EV charging is tailor-made for drivers to stop in for a bite to eat or buy a pack of beef jerky, a keychain with their name on it, or any number of other items.

US States Step Up As US Government Steps Down

State-based EV charging incentives are also continuing to lay the groundwork for an EV sales revival, with Illinois being the most recent one to join the fray. On November 6, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency launched a new $20 million program to install Level 3 and Level 2 public charging stations throughout the state.

The funds are available on a rolling basis starting on November 17 through the “Rebuild Illinois” capital plan for EV projects, authorized under the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“Governor Pritzker has prioritized electrification of the transportation sector to improve air quality and benefit the health of our residents,” explained Illinois Acting Director James Jennings. “To support that priority, we are committed to expanding the charging infrastructure necessary to power current and future electric vehicles throughout Illinois.”

In addition to meeting pre-qualification standards, applicants must demonstrate that their location fills a gap in public charging station availability. Sites that serve public transportation networks or Park-and-Ride facilities also score extra points.

“Additional funding will also be awarded to projects at a charging station location in an area identified as an Equity Investment Eligible Community through the EIEC mapping tool,” the Illinois EPA also notes.

Plenty More Where That Came From

The new program in Illinois is just the tip of the EV charging station iceberg. The Electric Vehicle Council branch of the organization Transportation Energy Institute has just published a new white paper that identifies funding opportunities across the US. The EV Council also provides lessons-learned guidance for sorting through the application process.

“For those developing funding programs, the EV Council provides strategic recommendations for streamlining incentive programs and grant application processes, based upon the real-world experiences of those who have participated in such programs,” TEI explains.

NEVI Lives To Charge Another Day

One of the resources TEI identifies is the $5 billion in federal funds earmarked for new public EV fast-charging stations during the Biden administration under the NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program.

And that’s where things get interesting. Launched in 2022 and funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the NEVI program assigned awards to all 50 states and tasked them with selecting locations that meet the funding criteria. However, some states were reluctant or unprepared to take advantage of the their awards before Biden left office in January.

The issue almost became moot after Trump took office and summarily ordered a halt to the program, but the courts eventually stepped in and ordered the funds to be restored. The EV charging software startup EV Connect is among the stakeholders following the NEVI saga. Their latest report shows that the program has a long way to go but it’s still alive and kicking.

“Progress has been steady but initially slow. As of mid-2025, only 148 chargers are operational across 12 states, with 84% of funds unobligated due to cumbersome regulations,” EV Connect reported on November 6.

Keep an eye out for activity to ramp up in the Southeast, which stakeholders have identified as a hotspot for EV charging stations and EV uptake, too.

EV Drivers Just Can’t Quit EVs

As for that EV uptake, some consumer surveys indicate that sales will eventually recover from the October debacle. “While the end of the EV tax credit will significantly affect EV sales volumes over the next several months, the bottom will not fall out of the EV market,” the firm JD Power reported on November 7.

“The percentage of active new-vehicle shoppers who say they are ‘very likely’ to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months increased to 24.2% in October, up from 21.6% in September,” the firm added.

JD Power also re-affirmed the well known fact that the TCO (total cost of ownership) for EVs can meet or beat conventional cars. “The number one reason EV owners select an EV over a gasoline-powered vehicle is expected lower running costs,” the firm noted, adding that in 86% of cases, EVs are “delivering on that expectation.”

Most surveys also show that a high percentage of EV drivers will choose another EV the next time they go car shopping. The new JD Power report is consistent with that, too.

“The data suggests that a significant number of current EV owners will be back in the market for a new car within the next year, and the majority of them plan to get another EV,” JD Power notes, citing the 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study. The EVX Study found that that 79% of current owners will definitely consider an EV for their next purchase, and another 15% will probably consider an EV.

“Furthermore, 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end in 2026, putting those customers back into the market for a new vehicle,” JD Power adds.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NEVI.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:18:57.804803

Associated Press

Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year's midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who's footing the bill to power Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average - although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,” said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.

Rising electric costs aren’t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year's campaigns.

Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.

With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, “it’s a life or death and ‘eat or heat’ type decision that people have to make,” said Charles Hua, PowerLines' founder.

In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of “rubber-stamping” rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.

Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.

Hubbard's message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see “more affordable pricing. That’s the main thing. It’s running my pocket right now.”

Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share - or share it with regular ratepayers.

Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots - or both - are fomenting community uprisings.

That includes California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.

That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.

Also playing a role is explosive demand from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising natural gas prices, analysts say.

“The cost of utility service is the new ‘cost of eggs’ concern for a lot of consumers,” said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.

In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.

Meanwhile, communities that don't want to live next to one are pushing back.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October found that electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

Now, as falls turns to winter, some states are warning that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown.

Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a “major” source of stress.

And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.

For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers - including data centers not even built yet.

Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.

That’s spurred governors from the region - including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection - to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.

Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, singled out Democratic-leaning states as the drivers of higher electric bills.

“The red states’ electricity rates are not going up at the rate the blue states are,” Maloney said. “But the data centers are largely going to the red states and the rates are still stable.”

Pull out some of those fast-rising rates - like in California, where wildfires are driving grid upgrades, and New England, where natural gas is expensive - and the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates, Maloney said.

Still, blue states are attracting data centers, too, and some red states are seeing higher electric bills.

In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state's for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying “we can’t take it anymore.”

SBOE and other news. - by Thomas Mills - PoliticsNC,Thomas Mills,,,,,https://www.politicsnc.com/p/anderson-clayton-v-sboe-and-other,"After Wednesday’s post, I got a bit of pushback because I didn’t mention North Carolina races.
North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, former political reporter Travis Fain, and I recorded an election roundup.
On another note, Anderson Clayton managed to throw the whole state auditor’s office into turmoil with a single tweet.
Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story.
So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","After Wednesday’s post, I got a bit of pushback because I didn’t mention North Carolina races. When I wrote my post early that morning, I didn’t have the information. Our state didn’t have any statewide or high-profile races, so the information wasn’t in one place. Most were relatively obscure municipal races in small towns across North Carolina. The information trickled in throughout the day.

I made up for it on Thursday. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, former political reporter Travis Fain, and I recorded an election roundup. I hope you’ll watch it.

Democratic wins in North Carolina were both broad and deep. According to Anderson, the party flipped more than 150 seats and the wins came in small towns, big cities, and suburban areas. The Assembly called it a “blue wave” even though many races were ostensibly nonpartisan.

In Charlotte, Democrats swept contested city council races, leaving just one Republican on the council. In Wake County, Democratic candidates defeated Republican mayors in Wake Forest, Holly Springs, and Fuquay Varina. Only one of the 22 GOP endorsed candidates in Wake County won. Democrats won in places like Alamance County where they took mayoral seats in both Burlington and Graham. They also won big in Guilford and New Hanover Counties.

Anderson makes a great point on the podcast. Republicans have now become a nationalized party. Everything is about Donald Trump. They’ve lost sight of the local issues that so often drive the electorate. That might work in presidential years, but Republicans are failing when Trump’s not on the ballot.

Nationally, Republicans are publicly in denial, downplaying their losses. That might make their base feel better, but it doesn’t do anything to fix the problems that led to their defeat. In order to avoid a wave election in 2026, they need to change the political environment and hoping it’s going to change on its own is probably a bad bet.

The most powerful determinant in any election cycle is the political environment. The corollary to that rule is that voters are more motivated to vote against something than for it. Anger and fear are the greatest motivators, not hope and change. People who went to the polls this year sent a message to the Republicans. Whether they receive it or not probably determines what happens next November.

In North Carolina, a similar political environment in 2026 could hand Republicans stinging losses in their remaining suburban legislative seats and cost them ones in exurban counties like Alamance. As long as prices are rising, jobs are flat, our cities are under attack, and constantly changing tariff policies ensure economic uncertainty, former Governor Roy Cooper starts the election season with a favorable wind at his back. If Trump switches gears, the winds could shift, too.

On another note, Anderson Clayton managed to throw the whole state auditor’s office into turmoil with a single tweet. It’s a great story and one with lessons for anyone in politics or public service. Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story. Read it here.

Apparently, the voter search tool on the State Board of Election’s website failed on the last day of early voting. The tool lets people see if they are currently registered and where they are supposed to vote. After the GOP legislature stripped control of the SBOE from the governor and gave it to Republican auditor Dave Boliek, that failure is a bit embarrassing. Democrats, of course, pounced because that’s what parties do.

The North Carolina Democratic Party twitter account blasted the SBOE for incompetence. They claimed the failure was “impacting poll workers’ ability to quickly identify and register voters.” That wasn’t quite right since the poll workers still had access to the voter rolls, but, hey, it’s Twitter and have you seen the stuff Republicans post?

Anderson reposted the tweets and wrote, “AND WHERE IN THE HELL IS STATE AUDITOR DAVE BOLIEK?” Instead of ignoring the political shots like a more seasoned political operation would have done, the SBOE decided they needed to elevate the back-and-forth. They sent out a press release blasting Clayton, who is not an elected or government official. She should take that press release as a badge of honor. Anytime you can make your opponents amplify your criticism of them, you’re winning the battle. Score one for Clayton.

(On a personal note, I’ve never been more proud than when Republicans filed complaints against me with the State Board of Elections because I was mean to them.)

Then, it comes out that the SBOE had an internal debate as to how to respond to the tweet in the first place. Patrick Gannon, the long-time spokesperson for the SBOE, is on paid leave for urging caution instead of reaction. Now, the story is not about the tweets but about turmoil within the SBOE. In addition, we all know that the newly formed State Board of Elections had problems in their first election cycle with the voter file tool. Score another for Clayton.

In the era of Trump, no slight goes unnoticed by Republicans. Thin-skin is the armor of the GOP. The SBOE should have listened to their communications professional. Patrick Gannon knew what to do, even if he’s paying the price for the incompetence of his bosses.

So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Uzs!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d68f6d-f253-4b9c-8663-ae935f9efcfd_1360x770.avif",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:31.132572

How Does It Work?,JT Wilson,,,,,https://www.motor1.com/news/778290/tesla-dealership-ev-tax-credit-scam/,"A Utah-based EV dealer has exposed how some dealerships allegedly manipulate federal tax credit rules, drawing outrage from viewers, and revealing questionable practices in the used electric vehicle market.
The Alleged Scheme Unfolds The caller's account entails a blatant attempt to work around federal tax credit requirements.
Something that qualifies for a tax credit, $25,000 or less,"" the caller told the salesperson.
Gallery: Tesla Model 3 Hearse Understanding the Tax Credit Requirements The federal used EV tax credit, which was officially known as the previously owned clean vehicle credit, had specific eligibility requirements designed to help lower-income buyers access electric vehicles.
Lawrence offered the customer ""$1,000 off any car I have"" for ""being such a good dude and doing the right thing.""","A Utah-based EV dealer has exposed how some dealerships allegedly manipulate federal tax credit rules, drawing outrage from viewers, and revealing questionable practices in the used electric vehicle market.

The two minute, 54 second video, which has garnered 979,000 views since June 11, features Alex Lawrence (@evautoalex) sharing a phone conversation with a follower who encountered what appears to be an illegal scheme to circumvent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations.

Lawrence, who runs EV Auto Alex and has built a following of over 163,000 subscribers by providing insider advice on EV financing and buying, recorded the conversation at his standup desk inside his Utah dealership. The video captures a live phone call with a TikTok follower who had attempted to purchase a used Tesla Model 3 the previous day from what he described as ""a big dealer group in Utah.""

The Alleged Scheme Unfolds

The caller's account entails a blatant attempt to work around federal tax credit requirements. According to the transcript, the customer visited the dealership specifically looking for a used Model 3 that would qualify for the federal tax credit—meaning it had to be priced at $25,000 or less.

""Hey, man, I'm looking for a used Model 3. Something that qualifies for a tax credit, $25,000 or less,"" the caller told the salesperson. The dealer showed him a vehicle with what appeared to be a $28,500 price tag.

When the customer questioned the price discrepancy, the salesperson allegedly revealed their workaround strategy. ""So what we do to get around that is we charge you 24.5 [thousand] on paper for the Tesla. And then we charge you like four grand for a charger,"" the caller recounted.

Until it expired on Sept. 30, the federal tax credit for used EVs provided up to $4,000 for qualifying vehicles, if the total purchase price excluding taxes and registration fees was under $25,000.

By artificially separating charges and listing mandatory add-ons as separate items, the dealership was allegedly attempting to make an ineligible vehicle appear compliant with IRS requirements.

According to IRS guidance on the expired credit, the sale price includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law, specifically including ""the retail price for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the vehicle at the time of sale."" The IRS explicitly states that dealers cannot reduce the sales price of a used clean vehicle based on mandatory add-ons, as ""the amount of the reduction would be considered part of the sale price for purposes of the credit.""

Customer Pushes Back With Evidence

The customer wasn't convinced by the salesperson's assurances. Armed with knowledge from Lawrence's previous educational videos, he challenged the dealership.

""I just saw a video referring to your video saying that was used to be a gray area, but it was just cleared up where the total purchase price, excluding taxes and registration, has to be below $25,000,"" the customer told dealership staff.

The finance manager was brought in to handle the situation, but continued to insist their method was legitimate. When the customer showed them Lawrence's TikTok explaining the regulations, the finance manager allegedly ""tried to brush it off,"" saying ""no, man, that's totally fine. We've done this a bunch of times. It's all good.""

Lawrence was tickled by this turn of events. ""Are you serious? You showed the finance manager a video of me?"" he asked, adding ""That's awesome.""

Pressure Tactics Escalate

When the customer requested written guarantees that the dealership would cover the $4,000 if the tax credit was denied, the finance manager refused. According to the caller, the dealership then attempted an even more questionable approach.

""Ultimately, he says, 'listen, man, we're going to sell you this right now. Tax, title, out the door, 24.5 [thousand]. And then tomorrow you have to come in and pay us $2,000 for TIPS,'"" the customer recounted.

Lawrence immediately recognized the legal implications. ""He wanted to do a separate transaction. Two grand. Dude, that is so illegal,"" he responded.

Had the customer gone through with this, it would likely have constituted tax fraud. The IRS has clear authority to pursue such arrangements as abusive tax avoidance transactions, which include ""sham arrangements having no economic significance or business purpose other than the avoidance or evasion of tax.""

Understanding the Tax Credit Requirements

The federal used EV tax credit, which was officially known as the previously owned clean vehicle credit, had specific eligibility requirements designed to help lower-income buyers access electric vehicles. To qualify, the vehicle needed to:

Be purchased from a licensed dealer

Cost no more than $25,000

Be at least two years old

Meet income requirements for the buyer

The IRS had been clear that the $25,000 limit applied to the total purchase price excluding only taxes, title, and registration fees. IRS documentation specified that the sale price ""includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law"" and explicitly included ""dealer documentation fees, which are part of the cost of purchasing a vehicle and are not required by federal or state law.""

Mandatory dealer add-ons, accessories, and extended warranties also needed to be included in the purchase price calculation.

The EV incentive was ended after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 4, eliminated it.

Community Response and Industry Recognition

The video sparked hundreds of comments from viewers, with many sharing similar experiences at dealerships across the country. Several commenters specifically mentioned dealership groups by name, suggesting the practice may be more widespread than initially apparent.

User Dylan Ericksen commented that a local dealership group was ""doing what they do best 10/10 don't recommend.”

Another commenter, asell87, shared their own experience with what appeared to be the same dealership group: ""I left a 1 star review after my experience. They called and sent me a check for $100 to remove the review. They are sleezy.""

When Lawrence asked for more information, asell87 elaborated, ""They called me after I left the review and said how about we send you $100 for the problems with the tire and have you remove that review. I received the $100 for the tire, but kept the review up because they definitely deserve it and want to warn others.""

Motor1 reached out to the alleged dealership via email for comment. We'll update this if it responds.

Customer Buys Their EV Elsewhere

Despite the frustrating experience, the story had a happy conclusion. Lawrence offered the customer ""$1,000 off any car I have"" for ""being such a good dude and doing the right thing."" The customer took him up on the offer, with Lawrence confirming in the comments that he ""came right in and bought"" a vehicle from EV Auto Alex.

The video also served an educational purpose, with several industry professionals commenting that they had learned from Lawrence's content. User brianatbutler wrote, ""I just got my dealership on board with this because of your videos! My managers had no idea about this. So thank you!!""

Dealership Workers Weigh In

The video attracted attention from dealership employees who wanted to ensure their own stores weren't engaging in similar practices. Halye commented, ""I work for a big dealership in Northern Utah and listen to these videos to get clues to make sure it's not any of ours. I have not come across any [dealerships] doing this so far!""

Lawrence responded that he wasn't ""aware of anyone in Davis county and north doing this,"" suggesting the practice might be concentrated in specific areas or dealer groups.

The Broader Implications

Lawrence's video highlights the importance of consumer education in navigating complex federal incentive programs. His approach—combining entertainment with practical advice—has clearly resonated with EV buyers who need reliable information in a rapidly evolving market.

The incident also demonstrates how social media can serve as a check on questionable business practices. The customer's decision to show Lawrence's educational content to the dealership staff shows how informed consumers can push back against potentially fraudulent schemes.

Lawrence indicated in the comments that he was aware of ""three"" dealerships engaging in similar practices and was ""trying to reach their owners direct man to man first"" before taking further action, suggesting he's taking a measured approach to addressing the issue.

About First Public Hydrogen The First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) is the United States’ 1st public hydrogen utility, designed to connect hydrogen producers with end users through a transparent, cost-effective model.","Following yesterday’s announcement that the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) is pausing operations, the First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) reassures stakeholders that hydrogen markets remain strong. The partnerships, infrastructure, and market activity built through ARCHES are key elements to hydrogen deployment, and we look forward to building on their success.

FPH2’s recent hydrogen supply solicitation drew a broad range of hydrogen suppliers, many new to the California market and ready to invest in our state, a clear indicator of an expanding renewable hydrogen market. Just last week, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) approved repowering Scattergood Generating Station, to a hydrogen-ready power plant. This will be the first large-scale green hydrogen power plant in California and the second hydrogen power plant for LADWP.

Additionally, the terminal operators and Port officials at nearly every port in California are unwaveringly pursuing new hydrogen solutions to help meet their clean air goals. Despite some changes with federal energy policy, we see strong and consistent public and private sector investment in the hydrogen economy in California, and growing interest in investing in equipment to integrate hydrogen as a renewable fuel in their operations. Looking across the hydrogen market in California, we need all renewable hydrogen projects to move forward to meet the new demand on the horizon; it is a very exciting time for California’s green economy and for hydrogen.

“Hydrogen is a key driver for new jobs and a critical element to achieve energy diversity and energy independence,” said FPH2 Chairman R. Rex Parris. “The global hydrogen economy is estimated to be just above $200 billion and growing. The US hosts more than 20% of the global economy, with California leading as one of the nation’s largest hydrogen economies and growing.”

“I have complete trust and confidence that First Public Hydrogen Authority will continue to do the heavy lifting required to get a robust supply of cost-effective hydrogen in time to meet our climate and energy goals and supply our hydrogen needs at the port complex,” said Matt Dickenson, Sustainability Director, Energy, & Decarbonization Manager for Fenix Marine.

Cities and transit agencies across the region, including Lancaster, Industry, Montebello, and others, are transitioning to hydrogen-powered buses, vehicles, backup uses such as traffic signals, and stationary power solutions. Despite the cancellation of federal funding, private-sector hydrogen suppliers and end users continue to pursue their projects. We will need all the new planned hydrogen production projects in the state to meet this growing demand we see on the horizon.

“Local work continues. Our customers are moving forward, suppliers are scaling, and the momentum remains strong. California’s hydrogen progress has always been built from the ground up, by cities, transit agencies, municipal utilities, ports, skilled labor, and industry working together,” said Ernesto Medrano, Executive Secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.

FPH2, the nation’s first public hydrogen utility, was created by cities to ensure that hydrogen deployment could continue reliably regardless of changes at the federal level. The Authority will continue to collaborate closely with partners and will sustain progress toward statewide clean-energy goals, local job creation, and long-term energy reliability.

Hydrogen activity in California has not paused. The projects are active, the partnerships are strong, and the work continues across communities statewide.

About First Public Hydrogen

The First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) is the United States’ 1st public hydrogen utility, designed to connect hydrogen producers with end users through a transparent, cost-effective model. As a Joint Powers Authority (JPA), FPH2 facilitates hydrogen procurement, delivery, and infrastructure development, helping municipalities, transit agencies, and private companies transition to clean energy.

* Charging stations are often called simply “chargers”, although technically speaking, they are AC charging stations that only supply power to the car’s onboard charger.
The Best Home EV Charging Stations Of 2025 (Up to 12 kW) ChargePoint Home Flex The top five list opens up with the ChargePoint Home Flex, a 12-kW (50 amps at 240 volts) hardwired charging station with a SAE J1772 or NACS charging connector.
Currently, Tesla offers two main hardwired charging stations: the Wall Connector (NACS charging connector) and the Universal Wall Connector (NACS charging connector with an integrated SAE J1772 adapter).
Final Thoughts At the end of his video for the best home EV charging stations of 2025, Tom Moloughney recommends hardwired installations as a more reliable option.","State Of Charge‘s Tom Moloughney has just announced his list of the best home EV charging stations of 2025, with his most recommended models. The list is based on an array of tests, in-depth reviews, and State Of Charge’s ChargerRater scores.

We believe that this is an invaluable resource for all in the market for residential EV charging equipment. The competition between the top models is fierce. Each model offers its own advantages and disadvantages. The common characteristics they all share are high-quality, reliability, Wi-Fi connectivity, and have received Tom’s seal of approval.

This year, the best products come from five manufacturers: ChargePoint, Emporia, EVIQO, Tesla, and United Chargers.

* Charging stations are often called simply “chargers”, although technically speaking, they are AC charging stations that only supply power to the car’s onboard charger.

In the article, we have attached links to some of the products in our shop, or to Amazon/manufacturer websites with referral codes, which we hope you might consider using to support State Of Charge and the EVChargingStations website.

The Best Home EV Charging Stations Of 2025 (Up to 12 kW)

ChargePoint Home Flex

The top five list opens up with the ChargePoint Home Flex, a 12-kW (50 amps at 240 volts) hardwired charging station with a SAE J1772 or NACS charging connector. The product is also available in a plug-in configuration (NEMA 14-50 or even NEMA 6-50), but the power is then limited to 9.6 kW (up to 40 amps at 240 volts).

The ChargePoint Home Flex has one of the best connectors (rubberized), an outstanding charging cable especially for cold-weather use, and a convenient integrated connector holster.

The smart app is advanced. However, Tom noted that one can’t connect two charging units in the same app, which may be an inconvenience in households with multiple stations. The charger also does not offer dynamic load management or power sharing features.

The hardwired version’s price is as low as $539 as of the posting of this article, while the NEMA 14-50 plug-in version is a bit more expensive at $599 (manufacturer’s regular price).

A unique feature of ChargePoint’s product is the option ($199) to switch the charging cable/connector from SAE J1772 to NACS (or vice versa). This might be helpful when switching from SAE J1772 to NACS in the future.

The ChargePoint Home Flex (hardwired version) received a total score of 86 points or 4.3/5 stars on the new, redesigned version of State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s a really good result.

Emporia Pro

The Emporia Pro debuts in State Of Charge’s top picks, in some way replacing the previous “Emporia” model, which remains on the market under a new name as the “Emporia Classic”.

The Emporia Pro is a high-end charger with numerous smart charging features (see the recent review from June 2025). The hardwired version can deliver up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), while the plug-in version with a NEMA 14-50 plug is rated at up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts).

Buyers can select a SAE J1772 connector or the new NACS connector option (Q4 2025) at purchase. The charging cable is thin, flexible (even in cold weather), and light, which makes things easier. The one thing that Tom dislikes is the connector holster — a bit thin and flimsy, but it can be replaced with a third-party product.

The Emporia Pro really shines when it comes to its software and smart features. It’s quickly becoming the go-to product for EV owners with a maxed-out utility service rating because its features enable them to avoid a costly electric panel upgrade.

Its Dynamic Load Balancing monitors the total draw of the home — including the charger — and temporarily limits the charger’s power as needed. This is a game-changing feature, which State Of Charge already had an opportunity to highlight in some of its recent videos: Installing a high-powered Emporia Pro EV charger in an apartment with a 100-amp electric service and Emporia Pro installation in a garage to solve the limited power issue.

The Emporia Pro’s regular price is $599, but considering its capabilities, it represents very high value.

The hardwired version of the Emporia Pro received a total score of 87 points or 4.35/5 stars on State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Emporia Classic

Before we move on, it’s worth making a slight pause for an honorable mention: the Emporia Classic. It is a less advanced version (no features like dynamic load balancing), but the cost is a quarter lower (check our shop here). It was one of the top models in 2024.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A from United Chargers is another new charging station on the list (in previous years, Tom listed the 40-amp Classic version). It’s a hardwired charging station with a power output of up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), and two charging connector options (SAE J1772 or NACS).

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A is a heavyweight contender. It has an extremely durable case for outdoor use, a nice, thin charging cable, an “ok” connector, and a remote connector holster. Tom describes the Grizzl-E Ultimate as a very good unit, available at an excellent price ($479.99 as of the posting of this article).

As with any charging station, the Grizzl-E Ultimate has some weaker points. Tom mentioned that it lacks advanced smart charging features, such as dynamic load management or power sharing. The app functionality is limited, although one can pair the charger to a different app, which is quite unique for United Chargers.

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Grizzl-E Classic

Because not everyone needs a 48-amp charger, Tom made an honorable mention of the Grizzl-E Classic plug-in version for a NEMA 14-50 outlet. It has a slightly lower power of up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts), but has an even more attractive price of $349.99. Currently, the Classic version is available only with the SAE J1772 connector (no NACS option yet).

EVIQO Evipower Gen2

In 2025, EVIQO introduced its second-generation smart residential charging station: the Evipower Gen2. The first-generation was among our most recommended models in 2024, and the new Gen 2 is even better, according to State Of Charge’s recent review.

The revised and improved EVIQO Evipower Gen2 comes in two versions: a hardwired version with a maximum power output of 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts) and a plug-in version (NEMA 14-50) with a maximum power output of 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts). Both can be ordered with either a SAE J1772 or a NACS charging connector.

The hardwired EVIQO Evipower Gen2 is a very high-quality product at an attractive price of just over $400 (down from the regular $599). The plug-in version costs $371.15 as of the posting of this article. For the best EVIQO Evipower prices, also check our affiliate link on Amazon; just make sure you select the Gen 2 version.

The second generation has an excellent charging cable with outstanding cold-weather performance (on par with ChargePoint). The charging connector is fantastic — solid, heavy, with a metal locking tab and rubberized grip. The connector holster is nice, too.

On the negative side, the app could benefit from additional features. There is no dynamic load management or power sharing between multiple units.

The EVIQO Evipower Gen2 received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Tesla Wall Connector & Tesla Universal Wall Connector

Tesla, the brand that needs no introduction in the EV industry, entered the charging business very early. Its third-generation charging stations are one of the best on the market.

Currently, Tesla offers two main hardwired charging stations: the Wall Connector (NACS charging connector) and the Universal Wall Connector (NACS charging connector with an integrated SAE J1772 adapter). They are both rated at up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts). There is no plug-in version for NEMA 14-50.

The two units are basically the same. The Universal Wall Connector can be used to charge EVs with a SAE J1772 charging port, which is important during the transition period from CCS1 to NACS in North America. Additionally, it has Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) capability when paired with the Tesla Cybertruck. However, the Universal Wall Connector costs $600, compared to $450 for the basic Wall Connector.

Strong points of the Tesla Wall Connectors are their thin and flexible charging cables and integration with Tesla’s software ecosystem. Multiple charging stations can share power between them (as far as we know, they must be the same generation). There is even a dynamic load management feature, but it’s not easy to set up, which Tom describes in detail in the video.

Before purchasing, one should make sure that the side-mounted connector holster fits their garage layout.

The Tesla Universal Wall Connector received a total score of 89 points or 4.45/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. This unit is especially recommended for EV users with SAE J1772-compatible vehicles who want to stay future-proof with the NACS charging standard.

The Tesla Wall Connector does not offer SAE J1772 charging option, but with a noticeably lower price it’s a very competitive charging station for all those who already stick with the NACS-compatible EVs.

Thanks to its competitive price, the Tesla Wall Connector received a total score of 91 points or 4.55/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s the highest score ever on the newly revised ChargerRater.

Full Power: 19.2 kW

Most EVs on the market in North America have onboard chargers rated at 7-12 kW, so 9.6-12 kW charging stations (40-50 amps at 240 volts) are the mainstream standard. However, some EVs have larger batteries and higher power chargers (up to 19.2 kW). To maximize charging, an 80-amp charger is the way to go. As a bonus recommendation, Tom selected one 80-amp charging station for this list.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A offers up to 19.2 kW of power (80 amps at 240 volts), provided one has an available 100-amp circuit (see a related review here). This model features the same capabilities as the lower-power Ultimate 48A version, which is among the top picks.

The price is higher at $899.99, but it’s very competitive compared to other 80-amp chargers.

Final Thoughts

At the end of his video for the best home EV charging stations of 2025, Tom Moloughney recommends hardwired installations as a more reliable option. If one prefers a plug-in configuration, it would be good to seek a model with a temperature sensor in the NEMA 14-50 plug.

Another thing is to prioritize quality, reliability, and safety over price. The installation should be inspected to minimize the risk of any issues arising over the years, or even a fire. EV charging stations draw high power over multiple hours, day after day, which is an entirely different duty cycle than other electric appliances in a household.

I was as skeptical as the next person: would making the transition to an EV result in driving a in a car I hate? Would driving an EV be a compromise?

Back in the day, EVs were small, often odd-looking and didn’t fit my need for kids, car seats and winter driving. They were fair-weather rides that sounded good but in practice, could be lacking.

Then came the EV revolution, with cars like the Kia EV9, the Mustang Mach-E and the Volvo EX90 as options for drivers and families who want to bypass the gas station and go electric. Those cars changed everything.

And now, I find myself among EV drivers, too. As a car reviewer, I drive a lot of every type of c ar, but my go-to every day, and the subject of a lot of my experience and stories, is the Hyundai Ioniq 5.

This story is 100% human-researched and written based on actual first-person knowledge, extensive experience, and expertise on the subject of cars and trucks. Additionally, we partnered with Electric For All on this story and associated social media posts, but all opinions are my own.

Why I Love My EV: It’s Just So Good

After driving many of the EVs on the road I began to appreciate the finesse of the EV experience: one-pedal driving which basically allows you to use only the accelerator to speed up or slow down, using the brake rarely if at all. The feel and experience of this is simply superior to driving a gas-powered car.

Add to that brake hold, which allows you to take your foot off the brake when you’ve stopped, is just incredible. It’s one of those things that once you get used to it, going back to regular driving just feels wrong.

Watch: Why I love my EV: It’s so easy to charge

Driving an EV Couldn’t Be Easier

I also love the quiet start of the car, the easy drive and the instant torque: taking off when the traffic light turns green is so quick, and merging onto the highway is a new delight.

But plugging in your car in your own garage and never having to think about stopping to fuel up is simply the best. I can think about charging the car when it’s convenient for me, not when it’s necessary or I happen to drive by a gas station.

And, charging at home is cheaper, even when you consider the cost of adding a charger to your garage or exterior of the house.

Charging an EV at home Saves Time and Money

For years, getting gas was the biggest pain of the week. The gas station was out of the way, the opposite direction of school, dance class, my work spot and the grocery store. And, there was always a line; it was cold/hot/rainy/sweaty. And expensive. Sometimes it would cost me $50 to fill the car, other times that same fill-up was $75. Never predictable.

Charging a car at home is the opposite. I can plug the car in at night, let it charge to my preferred 80% and it turns off when it’s done. I get into the car in the morning with a full charge (or, really, 80%) and I’m on my way.

EVs can charge using a standard household outlet, or they can charge faster with a level 2 charger. The difference is about 3-5 miles per hour added to the range with a 110V household outlet vs about 25 miles charged per hour at a 240V outlet.

How I Updated My Garage to Charge At Home

To facilitate a level 2 charger at home, I added a home charge outlet to my garage. Because I’m, uh, thrifty, I looked at how to do this safely but at the lowest cost: add a 240V outlet and a smart charge cord. Here’s what it cost:

$150 for the electrician to install the outlet

$230 for the smart charger

$20 for the cord hook to hold the charge cord

I didn’t need to do any work on my electrical panel or update any of the electrical systems in my house. Essentially, if you have an electric clothes dryer, you can add an EV charger. The smart cord, which is wifi-enabled, lets me turn on and off charging from my app and set the amperage level. The most powerful circuit breaker in my electrical panel is a 30 amp breaker, so I set the charge level to 24 and voila, no additional work needed to charge my EV. Even at 24 amps, it fully charges overnight.

Incentives Are Still a Thing—You Can Find Them Here

We all heard the sad news a couple of months ago when the federal government phased out EV incentives for new and used car purchases. But that does’t mean that incentives are gone; in fact, the local power company covered half the cost of my EV charger installation. It’s in their best interest, after all, to power my car, right?

And many states, utilities and others provide incentives, and some of them are quite generous. Electric For All provides an incentive locator by zip code so you can see what is available and how to qualify.

“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power.","LUSBY, Md. — Constellation announced a long-range proposal on Nov. 4 to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. According to the company’s release, the goal is to “meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth.”

The company proposed several projects as part of the state’s effort to fast-track innovative energy investments. Short-term projects include 1,500 megawatts of fast-track initiatives that could help address near-term needs, including battery storage and natural gas-powered solutions. Calvert Cliffs is part of the long-term proposal, as per the release:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

Nuclear energy is considered clean energy, and more nuclear energy programs are supported by a variety of groups.

The proposal also includes ways to make the energy market more competitive, which will, in theory, lower the cost for consumers.

“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation,” said Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez.

Can V2G and bidirectional charging be a game-changer for renewable energy?

V2G is the missing link for fully unlocking India’s renewable potential. Solar and wind energy are intermittent. EVs, acting as mobile storage units, are a solution to solve this instability problem. Bi-directional charging allows these assets to dynamically stabilise the grid during peak demand or when renewable generation dips. This capability transforms an EV fleet into a distributed energy reservoir, significantly accelerating the reliable integration of clean energy sources. We believe this is fundamental to India’s energy future, providing the required flexibility to the grid.

What’s the potential Impact of V2G on renewable energy and decarbonisation – any short/long-term targets we could aim for?

The impact is often monumental in such cases. Short-term, V2G pilots, especially for fleet operators, can demonstrate 5-10 MW of flexible localised capacity within 18-24 months. In the long term, our goal should be to leverage the entire EV population to displace gas peaker plants and store gigawatts of renewable energy. In the near future, V2G could contribute to some reduction in national peak power demand by 2035, playing a crucial role in meeting India’s decarbonisation commitments by ensuring our clean power is accessible 24/7.

What steps are needed for the integration of V2G-enabled EVs into the grid? – How long until we can see commercial assets/models being rolled out?

Well, there are three steps to this. First, establishing robust communication standards (like ISO 15118) for seamless grid interaction, after which, second is securing regulatory clarity from utilities and finally, launching large-scale pilot projects. Servotech is actively developing the necessary bi-directional hardware and we anticipate that focused commercial models, likely starting with captive fleets like corporate or transit buses, could see initial rollouts within 3 to 5 years, with mass market visibility following regulatory approval.

What type of govt policies/incentives do we require for V2G to work?

Firstly, we require clear and consistent policy direction, then the most vital incentives are Time-of-Use tariffs that financially reward EV owners for discharging energy during grid stress and perhaps federal grants for V2G-enabled charger installations. Furthermore, mandating smart meter penetration and standardising communication protocols are essential. In my professional opinion, a guaranteed rate of return for V2G participation is necessary to make the financial case compelling for the average consumer, driving initial adoption.

How can the auto industry overcome the complexities of infrastructure and interoperability – what factors can affect the economic case?

The auto industry must embrace standardisation as a primary undertaking, specifically adhering to global interoperability protocols like ISO 15118 for charging and communication. This would minimise the complexity and risk, as the economic case is fragile and is affected by high battery costs and uncertain lifetime revenues. Success depends on showcasing the total cost of ownership benefit to fleet owners. The car is not just a means of transport, but a revenue-generating asset used to offset purchase price and operational expenses.

Milestones and infrastructure developments are needed to move towards mass adoption.

There are certain milestones that we need to achieve to meet nationwide charger-to-EV ratio targets, driven by public-private partnerships. Infrastructure must evolve beyond basic AC charging to a pervasive DC bidirectional charging capability across urban centres. We also need smart grid readiness, meaning every V2G asset is connected through a unified, secure cloud platform for dynamic power management. These foundational steps, supported by robust cybersecurity frameworks, are critical to ensuring mass adoption is not only widespread but also safely managed by the grid operators.

What are the concerns about battery degradation?

Battery degradation is a legitimate concern, as excessive V2G cycling can impact battery lifespan. However, this is largely a technical challenge that can be overcome. We are focused on developing intelligent Battery Management Systems that use sophisticated algorithms to optimise charging/discharging cycles. This ensures grid service only occurs within ideal state-of-charge ranges, thus minimising stress. Furthermore, V2G services will be prioritised for commercial fleets where asset utilisation and managed charging cycles are already highly optimised.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/08/Untitled-design-3-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:01:35.882430

Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit—and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multimillion-dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus.

Dan Jasper, of the nonprofit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six rate increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents, who had embraced fossil fuels and backed away from clean energy at a time when demand for power is rising.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy nonprofit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about 9 months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said on Wednesday. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy—they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data center operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move was designed to give Democrats as many as five more seats in Congress in an effort to, among other things, combat further dismantling of climate and environmental policy. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out 5 new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies—those centering on transit, in particular—won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1 percent increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40 percent of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40 percent will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and microtransit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65 percent of voters approved a permanent 0.2 percent sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the country, one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies—and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills—won. “Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

But the most notable portent wasn’t the governor’s races won by Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. Nor was it Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City.

The most significant win for Democrats was in two little-watched races for Georgia’s utility board. Little-watched outside of Georgia, that is.

These races are important for several reasons. No Democrat has been elected to the five-member Georgia Public Service Commission since 2007. Georgia has become a bellwether in the conservative South, and it has 14 House seats.

What the above outcomes indicate is that much of the electorate has had it with Donald Trump: Tariff chaos. The fake wars waged on our cities’ streets. Bankrupt farms. Blatant corruption. The destruction of democratic institutions. It’s obviously getting harder for Trump to bully election officials in Georgia or elsewhere to “find” more votes than a candidate won.

Sherrill’s opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, might have done a lot better if he didn’t have Trump hanging around his neck. He was known as a moderate, the sort of Republican who can get elected in New Jersey. But he blew it playing cultural warrior, MAGA style.

As an aside, the media should stop making a big deal about Spanberger becoming “Virginia’s First Female Governor.” America currently has 12 women serving as governors. Several oversee conservative states: Kay Ivey in Alabama, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Laura Kelly in Kansas and Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas.

Spanberger came with an impressive background as a representative who had worked for the CIA. Sherrill, by the way, is preceded in the New Jersey governor’s mansion by Christine Todd Whitman (1994-2001).

The outcome in the races for Georgia’s utility board also reflected frustration with climbing electricity bills. Spiking electric costs are plaguing Americans all over the country, and they will get worse as large data centers rush in to scoop up available energy supplies.

Nationally, electricity prices have jumped 10% since January. Trump is making matters worse by ditching the Biden-era subsidies for clean energy. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill chops $500 billion from those projects.

So hot are Republicans to kill off these new energy sources that they’re stranding capital already invested in them. In August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order on a major wind project off New England that’s already 80% built. The bureau cited “concerns related to the protection of national security interests” without saying what they were. It took a federal court to lift that order.

Starting with Obama, America had pursued an all-of-the-above energy policy. That meant using traditional fossil fuels, the clean renewables and emerging sources, such as nuclear power, hydrogen and biofuels. (Texas is very good at this.) Now the policy is to stop the green-energy part, including infrastructure that even some oil companies supported.

The political battle that got the most attention was the race for New York mayor. The reasons were the colorful personalities, Mamdani’s controversial past and a Republican spoiler who wouldn’t leave the race. Add to that the New York-based media’s obsession with New York.

Mamdani has taken some of the edge off his more radical ideas by making nice with the “power brokers” he campaigned against. The hope is that he focuses on governing pragmatically — for which he will need some adult supervision. Unlike fellow Democratic Socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York mayor is an executive position overseeing a very complex organization. And no, Mamdani can’t single-handedly raise taxes on the rich.

But again, let’s not dwell on New York. For the most significant omen of Democrats’ prospects in the midterms, look to Georgia.

Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece.","Michigan regulators on Thursday adopted landmark standards for the booming data center industry with a plan they say tries to protect residents from subsidizing the industry’s hefty energy use.

In a 3-0 vote, the Michigan Public Service Commission adopted a rate structure that requires data centers and other energy-intensive industries in Consumers Energy’s territory to sign long-term power contracts with steep penalties for exiting early.

The order also requires Consumers to show that data centers will shoulder all costs to build transmission lines, substations and other infrastructure before adding them to the grid.

Commission Chair Dan Scripps called it a “balanced approach” that shows Michigan is “open for business from data centers and other large load customers, while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth … in a way that’s good for all customers.”

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources. Michigan utilities are legally required to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040. They must detail how they plan to meet that requirement in filings next year.

“While the order includes important consumer protection terms, the commission missed an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the state’s climate goals,” said Daniel Abrams, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

The rate structure applies to customers whose energy use exceeds 100 megawatts. Data centers are among very few industries that demand that much power. Often, they demand an order of magnitude more.

Consumers serves 1.9 million customers across much of the Lower Peninsula. Company spokesperson Matt Johnson said officials are still reviewing Thursday’s order and “its impact on all stakeholders.

“Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state’s economic development,” he added.

The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence. Much more energy is needed to power the transformation, but many industry analysts fear rising AI stocks are a bubble and demand for the technology won’t materialize, leaving utilities and ratepayers to pick up the infrastructure tab for failed projects.

Hoping to avoid such an outcome, Consumers in February proposed special regulations that would lock data centers into 15-year contracts that guarantee consistent electricity use and require payments even if a facility ceases or downsizes operations mid-contract.

The commission’s decision Thursday approves much of that request, with some significant modifications.

DTE takes a different approach

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.

Rather than establishing a blanket rate structure like Consumers, DTE wants to negotiate its first data center contract individually while aiming to avoid public vetting of the deal.

After announcing last week that it had inked an agreement to supply power for a proposed Stargate data center in Saline Township, DTE filed a draft 19-year contract with state energy regulators and requested swift approval without a public hearing.

Michigan law allows such expedited reviews in cases that would bring no added costs to utility consumers.

DTE officials argue adding the Stargate data center to its system will help keep rates down for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more paying customers.

“Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,” spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

But DTE officials also stated in its filing that the company expects to spend some $500 million upgrading its transmission system and building a substation to serve the data center. Critics argue the utility is so intentionally vague it is impossible to vet DTE’s claims about affordability.

“It’s just highly concerning that they are trying to keep this somewhat private, because there’s so much at stake,” said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also opposes DTE’s quest for expedited review, and has requested a thorough vetting of the proposed contract.

Members of the Public Service Commission have not decided whether to grant DTE’s request for quick approval, Scripps said.

Michigan’s data center electricity rate deliberations come amid a surge of interest from developers looking to take advantage of new tax breaks that could save the industry tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers last year voted to exempt large data centers from Michigan’s 6% sales and use tax in an effort to lure the industry to Michigan.

Beyond the Stargate campus, DTE is in late-stage negotiations for another 3 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity, while Consumers Energy is nearing deals for three large data centers amounting to a collective 2 gigawatts of power.

Developers are also scoping out rural land throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, from the Grand Rapids area to the outskirts of Monroe.

The wave of interest could have big implications for water and land use in Michigan. Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece. Those that use water vapor to cool the servers inside the facilities — the industry’s most common cooling technique — also use large amounts of water.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2025/11/07151127/AP25293782583792-1-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:32.617877

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs.

The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

• West Virginia: Up 27.71 percent

• Ohio: Up 30.11 percent

• Pennsylvania: Up 30.85 percent

• Virginia: Up 19.78 percent

• Kentucky: Up 17.66 percent

• North Carolina: up 24.17 percent

• Texas: Up 27.58 percent

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69 percent capacity all the time or forgo the ability to recoup future costs.

The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms.

The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market.

The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid — coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total generation: 87,551 megawatts

• Natural gas – 33,469 MW (38.22 percent)

• Nuclear: 28,371 MW (32.41 percent)

• Coal; 13,197 MW (15.07 percent)

• Renewable energy: 10,043 MW (11.47 percent)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: Natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per megawatt hour, while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh — nearly 50 percent more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69 percent when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed.

Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need — or want — to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity — ultimately increasing your power bill.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?","A pair of companies is partnering to lead the way in increasing production of EV batteries in the United States.

Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM) and Phillips 66 have teamed up to support the domestic electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage system (ESS) battery supply chain, according to Batteries News. EAM is a manufacturer of sustainable battery materials, and Phillips 66 is a leading producer of synthetic graphite anodes, a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which are the go-to choice for EV batteries.

The way the partnership will work is that Phillips 66 will provide Green and Calcined Needle Coke (which goes into the synthetic graphite anodes) from its refinery in Louisiana to support EAM's graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina, currently under development.

EAM's facility is on track to begin operations in 2027 and is expected to provide enough graphite active anode to power approximately one million EVs a year.

""This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,"" Vikram Handa, Managing Director of EAM, said.

Graphite is a key component in EV batteries, but it often comes from foreign sources, some of which have weaker labor and environmental protections. It also helps alleviate concerns over tariffs disrupting supply chains, like China banning the export of the mineral to the U.S.

This partnership is excellent news for avoiding those issues, as well as keeping pace with the ever-expanding U.S. EV market. The demand for EVs is increasing, with the International Energy Agency reporting that more than 20% of new cars being sold are EVs.

EVs are becoming popular for a variety of reasons, one of the primary being financial. You can save up to $2,200 a year driving a fully electric vehicle, per the U.S. Department of Energy, because you're cutting down on fuel and maintenance costs.

The other benefit of EVs is their low environmental impact. EVs release no tailpipe emissions, meaning they aren't contributing to the planet-warming gases that pollute our atmosphere. And as the EPA notes, while charging your battery may increase pollution at the power plant level, it's still less of an impact than a traditional gas-powered vehicle. That impact can be lowered even further if you install solar panels at your home to charge your EV. You can check out EnergySage for vetted sources that provide accurate and fair prices on solar installations tailored to your needs.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?

The most common source of greenhouse gas emissions is burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and heat, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Reducing transportation emissions

Short-term transportation strategies in the plan include prioritizing where and when to add bicycles lanes, pathways, and sidewalks. The city will also create parking incentives for people to use bicycles and other non-motorized transportation instead of vehicles.

The plan also recommends making sustainability projects eligible for funding from the city’s local option taxes, which currently raises more than $3 million per year.

Piloting a bicycle or e-bike share program and making electric vehicle charging more accessible to neighborhoods are two medium-term strategies identified in the plan, which does not define a specific timeline for “medium-term.”

The plan urges the city to help expand Mountain Community Transit, a public bus service that operates in McCall and includes routes to Donnelly, Cascade, and New Meadows.

A long-term goal for the city is for 50% of the local workforce to live within five miles of the city to reduce commuter miles, which in 2021 were estimated at nearly 350,000 miles per year for 64 city employees.

“Actually getting people out of vehicles entirely is a very big goal of this plan at this point,” City and Sustainability Planner Meredith Todd said.

Community health and resilience

The plan also includes 10 strategies for community health and resilience — the second of three focus areas the plan is divided into. Health and resilience strategies aim to reduce emissions from residential and commercial buildings, which combine to account for another 43% of the city’s emissions, according to the plan.

Strategies include establishing a Green Business Program, incentivizing energy efficient housing, creating a drought resilience plan, and expanded use of energy from wind, water, and solar.

A Green Business Program could include efficiency trainings for contractors, assistance programs for energy efficiency upgrades in buildings, and promotion of green business practices in McCall.

Wildfire resistant landscaping and design standards should also be created around McCall through wildfire risk overlay zones, according to the plan.

Destination management

The final focus area in the plan is destination management, which involves adopting a “holistic approach” to managing the city’s tourism economy.

The first strategy recommended by the plan is to create a destination management plan, a process the city council was briefed on earlier this year, as Valley Lookout reported.

Other strategies include adopting land management strategies that increase the ability of soil and plants to absorb and store carbon dioxide, a process known as carbon sequestration. Strategies for reducing pollutant-laden run-off could also be developed.

The city should also explore partnerships for public education to encourage eco-tourism and promote other strategies, the plan said.

The Rooted in Resilience plan was developed by Lotus Engineering and Sustainability, a Denver engineering firm hired by the city in 2024 to write the plan for about $94,000l

Strategies in the plan are informed by more than 2,000 survey respondents, four focus group sessions, and five community events held over the last two years.

The climate plan is a continuation of recent environmental efforts by the city over the last seven years.

In 2018, the city conducted a greenhouse gas inventory to determine local sources of greenhouse gases and estimated amounts contributed to the atmosphere per year.

A follow-up study in 2021 estimated that the city’s greenhouse gas emissions had increased by about 13% since the first study. The inventory was updated again by Lotus as part of the Rooted in Resilience plan.",https://valleylookout.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/valleylookout.com-rooted-in-resilience-mccall-adopts-first-climate-action-plan-screenshot-2025-11-07-at-3.42.37-pm.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 13:01:47.844732

U.S. airlines began canceling hundreds of flights Thursday due to the Federal Aviation Administration’s order to reduce traffic at the country’s busiest airports starting Friday because of the government shutdown.

More than 790 planned Friday flights were cut from airline schedules, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions. That number, already four times higher than Thursday's daily total, was likely to keep climbing.

The 40 airports selected by the FAA span more than two dozen states and include hubs such as Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the agency's order, which was published Thursday evening. In some metropolitan areas, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington, multiple airports will be impacted.

The FAA said in the order that the reductions will start Friday at 4% and ramp up to 10% by Nov. 14. They are to be in effect between 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time and impact all commercial airlines.

The decision to reduce service at “high-volume” markets is meant to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the shutdown. It also comes as the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.

Federal judge orders Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits in November

A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to find the money to fully fund SNAP benefits for November, a decision that the administration promptly appealed.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump's administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it's unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.

The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.

“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”

McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.

Supreme Court lets Trump block transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision is Trump’s latest win on the court's emergency docket, and allows the administration to enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to correspond with their gender identity on new or renewed passports. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.

The high court has sided with the government in nearly two dozen short-term orders on a range of policies since the start of Trump's second term, including another case barring transgender people from serving in the military.

In a brief, unsigned order, the conservative-majority court said the policy isn't discriminatory. “Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” it said. “In both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.""

The court’s three liberal justices disagreed, saying in a dissent that those passports make transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination.”

Musk could become history's first trillionaire as Tesla shareholders approve giant pay package

NEW YORK (AP) — The world’s richest man was just handed a chance to become history’s first trillionaire.

Elon Musk won a shareholder vote on Thursday that would give the Tesla CEO stock worth $1 trillion if he hits certain performance targets over the next decade. The vote followed weeks of debate over his management record at the electric car maker and whether anyone deserved such unprecedented pay, drawing heated commentary from small investors to giant pension funds and even the pope.

In the end, more than 75% of voters approved the plan as shareholders gathered in Austin, Texas, for their annual meeting.

“Fantastic group of shareholders,"" Musk said after the final vote was tallied, adding “Hang on to your Tesla stock.”

The vote is a resounding victory for Musk showing investors still have faith in him as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits in no small part due to Musk himself. Car buyers fled the company this year as he has ventured into politics both in the U.S. and Europe, and trafficked in conspiracy theories.

Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection, ending her storied career in the US House

WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. And she left those who sent her to Congress with a call to action to carry on the legacy of agenda-setting both in the U.S. and around the world.

“My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. “We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way.”

Kazakhstan will join the Abraham Accords with Israel in symbolic move to boost the Trump initiative

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab and Muslim majority countries in a symbolic move aimed at boosting the initiative that was a hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first administration.

The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations — Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.

Those countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The move was first confirmed to The Associated Press by three U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to detail plans that hadn't yet been made public. Hours later, Trump posted on his social media site that he’d had “a great call between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of Israel, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, of Kazakhstan” and that Kazakhstan is the “first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.”

Trump called Kazakhstan joining “a major step forward in building bridges across the World” and said “more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.”

Trump unveils deal to expand coverage and lower costs on obesity drugs

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for the popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

Known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, the drugs have soared in popularity in recent years, but patient access has been a consistent problem because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty. More than 100 million American adults are obese, according to federal estimates.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.

A former teacher shot by student, 6, wins $10M jury verdict against ex-assistant principal

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — A jury in Virginia awarded $10 million Thursday to a former teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student, siding with her claims in a lawsuit that an ex-administrator ignored repeated warnings that the child had a gun.

The jury returned its decision against Ebony Parker, a former assistant principal at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.

Abby Zwerner was shot in January 2023 as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom. She had sought $40 million against Parker in the lawsuit.

Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.

Zwerner did not address reporters outside the courthouse after the decision was announced. One of her attorneys, Diane Toscano, said the verdict sends a message that what happened at the school ""was wrong and is not going to be tolerated, that safety has to be the first concern at school. I think it’s a great message.”

There are more than 100 autoimmune diseases, and they mostly strike women. Here's what to know

Our immune system has a dark side: It’s supposed to fight off invaders to keep us healthy. But sometimes it turns traitor and attacks our own cells and tissues.

What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body – and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise.

New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.

“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.

Here are some things to know.

Cowboys' Marshawn Kneeland found dead of apparent suicide at 24 after evading officers, police say

Police in a Dallas suburb say 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland was found dead of an apparent suicide after evading authorities in his vehicle and fleeing the scene of an accident on foot.

Frisco police said Thursday they are investigating the suicide. They said Kneeland didn't stop for Texas Department of Public Safety troopers over a traffic violation in a chase that was joined by Frisco police on Wednesday night.

Authorities lost sight of the vehicle before locating it crashed minutes later. During the search after Kneeland fled the crash site on foot, officers said they received word that Kneeland might be suicidal.

As authorities were looking for Kneeland, a dispatcher told officers that people who knew him had received a group text from Kneeland “saying goodbye. They’re concerned for his welfare,” according to recordings from Broadcastify, which archives public safety radio feeds.

“We’re talking to the girlfriend. She’s trying to call his agent. But we’re trying to get her to call him first. But she’s saying he is armed and has a history of mental illness. And her quote was, ‘He will end it all,’” another dispatcher told officers.",,N,,2025-11-08 09:58:30.174187

Hydron Energy Inc. is lining up customers for its proprietary INTRUPTor, a machine that takes raw byproduct gases emitted from places like landfills, sewage plants and farms and upgrades them into renewable natural gas (RNG).

The process, developed by Hydron CEO Soheil Khiavi, uses “biomimicry,” making the machine work like a pair of lungs. Unlike existing technology to refine RNG, the INTRUPTor works at atmospheric conditions and without the need for high pressures or temperatures. It means the renewable natural gas can be upgraded at about half the capital and operating costs, delivering gas with 80 per cent lower emissions.

Earlier this year, the company concluded its first field test at a farm in Ontario.

“The results came back basically excellent. It was no problem. All the key performance metrics were met, some of them exceeded and we had a really good, happy customer. That turned into a purchase order for full-size plant,” Khiavi said.

Hydron has since signed agreements for other projects with FortisBC, Northwest Natural Gas in Oregon and the City of Chilliwack.

When it became clear that Hydron was going to go from a research and development firm to a manufacturer, the company began taking over 20,000 square feet space within their Lynn Creek area light industrial complex. Rooms that used to be ballet studios with mirrors still on the walls are now being used to assemble their patented tech. That has also meant staffing up.

“Currently we are about 20 people,"" Khiavi said. ""Our goal is to double up, so 40 people here by end of next year, and mostly on the manufacturing of our novel biomimicry, metalorganic framework, which is the secret sauce of the technology.”

Despite tariffs and setbacks in U.S. interest in decarbonization projects, Washington State and California’s governments are still going ahead with clean energy plans, Khiavi said. And Hydron is seeking out more markets in Europe and Asia.

Singapore and Thailand buy massive amounts of LNG at a premium from the Middle East to fuel their growing economies, but Khiavi said all of the gasses coming from their own biomass are being incinerated and emitted into the atmosphere with no benefit to anyone.

“If they actually use this technology, they can produce a big portion – up to 10 per cent of the gas that they need – just using their waste, at a price that is almost half of the import price of the LNG. It’s going to save them a lot of money,” he said.

Khiavi said the greatest potential for the technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally is in the “hard-to-abate” sector, and places in the world where other green sources of energy are not practical or available.

“We can actually cover a big portion of that,” he said. “10 to 12 per cent of the carbon emissions could be replaced…. The impact is huge.”

What’s more, Khiavi said, they are exploring other novel applications for the INTRUPTor’s biomimicry. In the lab, they are capturing small amounts of rare gases like xenon and krypton out of thin air. Aerospace customers need those gases for satellite propulsion, but there is a shortage in the market because the primary source for them in the world was a plant in Ukraine that was bombed by Russia early in the war.

And the same process captures planet-warming carbon dioxide and sequesters it while refining the rare gases.

“I’m quite excited. It’s a good result,” Khiavi said. “The dream I have is that we make British Columbia as a rare gas hub.”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/nsnews/newsengin/2025/11/web1_nsn-20251031-hydron-energy.jpg;w=1000;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-11-08 08:18:24.762248

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.
The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.
The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.
In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.","Washington farm groups are concerned the Department of Ecology will punish farmers and ranchers who decline to adopt large riparian buffers and other “best management practices.”

Ecology labels the practices, or “BMPs,” as “voluntary guidance.” But Ecology has drafted a pollution-control plan claiming the power to “require the implementation of best management practices.”

Farm groups are lobbying Ecology to clarify that the BMPs will be truly voluntary. They also want Ecology to pledge not to punish farmers who decline to adopt the department’s BMPs.

“Our concern is the BMPs will be voluntary, until they become mandatory,” Washington State Water Resources executive director John Stuhmiller said.

Ecology plans to submit the pollution-control plan to the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of the year. The plan will describe how Ecology will keep dirt and chemicals from running into waterways. Ecology periodically updates the plan to stay eligible for federal money.

Simultaneously, Ecology is taking public comments on BMPs for agriculture. Ecology developed the BMPs over several years. They purportedly are the best ways to prevent runoff, or “nonpoint,” pollution.

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.

Although called “voluntary,” the BMP document sometimes uses the word “must,” such as fences “must” keep livestock 25 feet from ditches.

The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.

The Legislature rejected a bill requiring large buffers. The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.

“That could eliminate a lot of ground,” he said. “This plan is going to have an impact on anyone who has water on or adjacent to their property.”

Ecology’s plan holds out the possibility of penalizing “recalcitrant landowners” who don’t implement BMPs. The plan’s tone won’t encourage landowners to seek guidance from Ecology, Field said. “I don’t think the plan gives people that feeling.”

Ecology intends for the BMPs to help landowners comply with water-quality standards, department spokeswoman Colleen Keltz said in an email.

“Decisions about how to achieve compliance, about whether to implement recommended BMPs, and about which practices to choose remain in the hands of the producer,” she said.

“We recognize every property is unique and will continue to work on site-specific solutions as needed that reduce pollution and protect water quality,” Keltz said.

Ecology posts on its website a 2019 memo from the attorney general’s office stating it has the power to manage farmers who are polluting or have a “substantial potential” to pollute,

“Ecology’s authority includes the authority to require a nonpoint-source polluter to implement specific management measures,” the memo states.

Ranchers who do not adopt Ecology’s preferred practices could face penalties, the Washington Cattlemen’s Association warns.

In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.

“It imposes unproven, costly and often-impractical measures under the guise of ‘voluntary’ participation,’ ” the cattlemen said.

This is also the reason why GM decided against offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles.
This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists.","After GM announced abandoning Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the decision started a heated debate about the phone projection support. The carmaker argued that phone projection only provides limited functionalities, and a native solution is far superior. To be fair, GM is not the only carmaker that doesn't want Apple and Google trespassing on its turf. Others have refused to accommodate them from the get-go, even if this irked their customers.

Tesla has never considered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it has been just fine regardless. Firstly, because it sold most of its vehicles to a strong base of die-hard fans, who were perfectly fine with anything Elon Musk chose for them. Secondly, Tesla's software is so good that nobody really misses phone projection apps. Rivian has followed a similar path, although for different reasons.

While Rivian's software is considered second-best after Tesla's, the EV startup is nowhere near Tesla's software experience. Its customers have long begged and threatened the company to bring Apple CarPlay support, without success. Rivian thinks that it will be able to match and even better phone projection apps with its in-dash infotainment solution.

Why are some carmakers refusing to offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

The bet is not only on retaining customer data in-house, but also on selling lucrative subscriptions for functions that Apple and Google offer free of charge. This is also the reason why GM decided against offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles. More recently, the Detroit carmaker announced that it would also remove phone projection support from its combustion vehicles, enraging more owners. While carmakers want us to believe that their native infotainment systems are way better than using our phones, this also locks owners onto the maker of their vehicles. Strangely, GM was the one proving how bad this is for its customers, especially when the carmakers decide to pull the plug on certain features.

Case in point, GM just shut down its NGI app store, which allows installing apps in older (but not very old) Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles. The decision, which took effect September 30, turned the infotainment systems of millions of cars into dumb radios. Owners can still use the installed apps, but they are not supported anymore. If they decide to delete the app or reset the infotainment systems, they are gone for good, and attempts to reinstall them will fail.

Which GM vehicles are affected by the NGI app store shutdown?

Among the Chevrolet-branded affected models are the 2017-2018 Camaro and Silverado 1500, 2017-2019 Corvette, Cruze, Malibu, Silverado HD, Suburban, Tahoe, Volt, 2017-2020 Colorado and Impala, 2018-2019 Traverse and Trax, and 2019-2020 Equinox.

Buick adds 2017-2018 Verano, 2017-2020 Regal, 2017-2021 Encore, 2018-2019 Enclave, and 2019-2020 Envision to the list, while Cadillac has 2017-2019 ATS, CTS, XT5, XTS, as well as 2017-2020 CT6 and Escalade. GMC completes the list with the 2017-2018 Sierra 1500, 2017-2019 Acadia, Sierra HD, and Yukon, as well as the 2017-2020 Canyon.

As you can see, a lot of vehicle owners as new as MY2021 are left without software support and the possibility to reinstall or install new apps. This is not the first time it has happened, and likely won't be the last. We've seen it recently when the 3G networks across the globe shut down, leaving many vehicles without internet connectivity.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support is an underrated feature

This shows that relying on a carmaker to provide the right infotainment features is futile. GM is eager to sell you a new car with Android Automotive rather than supporting its old models. Not only because it makes money from selling cars (partly), but also because supporting old software is cumbersome. GM is focusing on current software platforms, leaving older hardware behind. It also shows that even modern infotainment systems have a much shorter lifespan than a typical vehicle. People tend to keep their cars for at least five years, and even after that, they are not scrapped but start a new life as used vehicles. It's not unusual to see people riding in 15-year-old cars or older, especially when they are well-maintained.

In this case, we're talking about much newer vehicles that are still far from their projected end of life. Can you imagine paying $100k on a 2020 Escalade and not being able to use apps on it after only five years?

This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists. You might upgrade your phone every two years, but your vehicle would still allow you to use the same familiar interface. It's a different story with locked-down infotainment systems, which a carmaker can deprecate at any time to force you to buy a new one.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gm-kills-infotainment-apps-in-millions-of-vehicles-proving-carplay-support-is-crucial-260524_1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 07:17:31.903064

Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security.","I’m here in Belém, Brazil for the annual UN Climate talks (COP 30) set to get underway on November 10 in the shadow of a sobering United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report confirming the world will breach the 1.5ºC mark. Before we plunge into hectic agenda fights and intense negotiations over bracketed text in draft agreements, it’s worth remembering what these talks are ultimately about. They’re about decisions made by world leaders that are deeply consequential for everyone’s health and prosperity, and that will determine the kind of world we leave for future generations.

Many of the issues are perennial, and they will surface in specific ways at this COP—billed as an ‘implementation’ COP meant to focus on climate actions that need to be taken now not just vague promises of future commitments.

In a previous blogpost, I highlighted some things to watch at this COP, including how countries plan to step up ambition on their emissions reduction commitments, aka nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and the need to simultaneously advance adaptation measures. I also called attention to whether trust can be rebuilt over richer nations’ grossly insufficient climate finance for lower income countries. Of course, the influence of fossil fuel interests that swarm COP is a major threat to ambitious outcomes here.

At the heart of global climate agreements is the recognition that we cannot solve this problem solely as individual countries, regardless of how big or small, but we can succeed if we tackle it together by each doing our fair part.

Synergies between global and domestic climate action

COP can feel remote and arcane, but what’s agreed to here can boost clean energy and climate efforts at home—and what countries do through domestic policies and investments significantly affects the level of ambition at COP. At COP and at home, those actions must include efforts to expand access to cheap, clean, renewable electricity while phasing out polluting fossil fuels; opportunities to protect communities from climate impacts already baked in; and signals to decision makers across the global economy about aligning innovation and investments with climate and human development goals.

Acting together by boosting renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels, we can bend the global emissions curve meaningfully and limit the rise in global average temperatures. At the same time, the emissions building up in the atmosphere come primarily from richer nations—although other major emitters like China are playing a growing role—and are unleashing costly and deadly impacts around the world already. Therefore, every country must also invest in protecting its people, economy and critical ecosystems from these worsening impacts, and richer nations have a responsibility to pay toward those efforts in lower-income nations.

The synergies between domestic policies and global climate ambition are crucial. When they work well, we get a multiplication of collective efforts. The Paris Agreement, secured 10 years ago, led to a crucial acceleration in clean energy deployment around the world and cuts in heat-trapping emissions.

Clean energy was already on the rise, and nations and businesses took the Paris Agreement as a guide to accelerate that momentum through domestic policies and investments. Collectively, that has helped bend the global emissions trajectory and reduce how much global average temperatures will rise over this century (albeit not by nearly enough as we are still on track to overshoot 1.5°C and even 2°C).

But when those synergies fray or break down, the impact can also be felt both at home and on the global stage. Right now, we are at one of those critical junctures, as the Trump administration tears up US clean energy policies and investments, disgracefully steps away from the Paris Agreement, and tries to undermine global climate action. At Belém, it will be crucial for the other 190+ nations to isolate the Trump administration in its deeply harmful actions and anti-science rhetoric and forge ahead to find an ambitious global consensus.

It’s in every nation’s self-interest to limit dangerous climate change and embrace the economic and public health benefits of a clean energy transition—and it’s in the global collective interest. The time for zero sum thinking and hiding behind other countries’ inaction is over as the planet teeters on the brink of overshooting 1.5°C of warming.

Why COP 30 Matters

COP is an opportunity to see the challenges in our daily lives mirrored in struggles around the world, and to seek common ground in addressing them in ways that prioritize regular people, not powerful political interests and the billionaire class. The massive global income inequities, that amplify the harms in the lowest income countries and communities, also come into focus here.

As I prepare for COP, I’ve been reflecting on how extreme climate-fueled disasters are now a harsh reality for so many people across the United States and the world. The people still reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton have something life-altering in common with people in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba recently hit by Hurricane Melissa.

Also, the people in the Philippines who have just endured Typhoon Kalmeigi and other cyclones this year, on the heels of a record-breaking 2024 cyclone season. Small island nations face looming existential threats from sea level rise that will be familiar to people in coastal Louisiana.

No one chooses to be on the frontlines of these disasters they did not cause, and everyone deserves support in getting back on their feet and being better protected from the next storm, or wildfire, or flood. Meanwhile, the UNEP Adaptation Gap report points out the huge shortfall in current funding for adaptation in lower income nations. This is an issue that will be front and center at this COP.

I’ve also been thinking about how people at home in the United States are struggling to afford their electricity bills, even as the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are decimating clean energy policies that would have helped drive down costs, and even as the costs of proliferating data centers are being passed on to all of us consumers.

Meanwhile, around the world millions of people don’t even have access to modern forms of energy and all too many depend on polluting fossil fuels that are taking a steep toll on their health. Massively ramping up renewable energy and energy efficiency (and the infrastructure to enable that)—solutions that are at our fingertips already and that are cheaper than fossil fuels in most cases—is unquestionably the commonsense path forward to tackling many of these challenges.

Being at COP is a fresh reminder that alleviating global poverty and improving people’s lives is directly and intrinsically connected to addressing climate change. Solutions to all these grave and pressing challenges can and should be aligned.

Misguided calls to pit these priorities against each other are puzzling, wrong and deeply harmful. Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security. Investing in expanding access to renewable energy, drought-resistant crops, heat health protections for workers, universal healthcare, safe affordable housing, and a human rights-centered framework for people displaced by disasters are crucial both for people’s health and economic well-being, and for addressing worsening climate impacts.

Solving for problems simultaneously is the call of the hour, and it’s a no-brainer. What’s often standing in the way are entrenched interests who are making a lot of money off the current fossil fuel-based economy and are craven enough to weaponize the plight of people who live in poverty to keep the world chained to polluting fossil fuels.

Acting together is the antidote to delay, distractions and lies

Back in 1992, the world adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), here in Brazil, recognizing the science on climate change and the imperative to act together based on that science. It’s an almost miraculous global agreement that truly stands the test of time. Here is Article 2 from the UNFCCC, for example:

The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

Despite the clarity and urgency of scientific reports from the IPCC and others in the decades since then, governments have not adopted strong enough policies and the fossil fuel industry still holds far too much sway over the world’s energy choices.

That we are at this sobering moment in the climate fight can be cause for gloom. I am here alongside many smart, committed people—including leaders from US states, cities and businesses, and climate justice advocates from around the world—because the fight still matters. It matters more than ever. We know the causes of climate change, we know the solutions to address it—now let’s get our political leaders to adopt them, using every beneficial tool at our disposal.

COP is by no means the only venue for this fight—although it is an important one, as it’s the only place where every country, no matter how big or small, has a voice. Everyone has a role and place where they can engage in this fight for our future.

Here in the US that could be in your public utility commission proceedings, in state legislatures, through efforts to push back against EPA’s rollback of the Endangerment Finding, or through investments your business makes. It could be through art that provokes and engages more people. It could be through campaigns to save precious forest and coastal ecosystems. And it’s tremendously uplifting to know that like-minded people around the world are also fighting where they can for these same goals and aspirations.

As ever, this is a fight we can only win by acting together, from our backyards to the world.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Antonio-Guterres-COP30.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:36.439419

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has launched an all-out assault against two of the most prominent sources of clean energy—wind and solar.

Trump has lambasted the technologies as the “scam of the century” while providing what critics describe as giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, increasing lease sales for drilling and mandating that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

His signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act significantly accelerated the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects, pulling back on commitments made under the Inflation Reduction Act several years prior.

Even renewable projects already in progress have suffered. Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind, two offshore wind projects in the Northeast that were under construction, received stop work orders from the Trump administration before ultimately being allowed to proceed.

Despite those headwinds, one pro-renewable group is offering something that’s been hard to come by lately: optimism.

“I really don’t think that this is a time for despair and withdrawal,” said Dan Stein, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Giving Green.

In a new report released on Wednesday, the research and grant-making organization highlighted what it sees as two opportunities to advance clean energy in a bipartisan fashion, even in an intensely polarized environment: commercializing what it describes as “clean firm power” technologies such as nuclear and geothermal, and addressing barriers to clean energy deployment such as federal permitting delays.

The report challenges concerns that clean energy is a lost cause under the Trump administration. Instead, the group’s strategy sees room to work directly with the administration on clean energy policy—rejecting the idea that advocates should shift their focus away from federal action in favor of an exclusive focus on state and local policies.

According to Giving Green, clean firm power refers to technologies that can produce emissions-free electricity on demand and over long periods of time. This differs from technologies like wind and solar, which don’t provide consistent energy throughout the day or across seasons.

Stein acknowledges that wind and solar play an important role in decarbonizing the energy grid since they are the cheapest and most technologically ready clean energy sources. However, he argues that the limitations of those technologies’ ability to provide consistent energy mean that they likely aren’t suitable to provide 100 percent of future electricity needs.

“You need to kind of bend over backwards the more and more you put solar and wind on the grid,” Stein said. “You need to make sure that you have big transmission lines to move energy around from the places where the wind is blowing, you need some batteries that will move power from day to night and even maybe from summer to winter.”

According to Armond Cohen, executive director and founder of Clean Air Task Force—which was awarded a two-year, $4 million grant by Giving Green on Wednesday—that means clean energy advocates need to start pressing for additional energy solutions.

“We can quibble over whether 80 percent of the problem can be solved with wind and solar or 50 percent, but I think there’s pretty much an emerging consensus that that is not 100 percent,” Cohen said.

To fill those gaps, Giving Green’s strategy aims to boost alternative technologies it believes could most benefit from philanthropic intervention.

The report highlights two technologies in particular—“next-gen” geothermal and nuclear fission—as top priorities due to their feasibility, scale and funding needs.

Those two technologies have been left largely unscathed by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy—and in some cases have even received its explicit support.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright included advanced nuclear and geothermal power in his first secretarial order as part of the department’s vision to “unleash American energy innovation.” And in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax credits for nuclear and commercial-scale geothermal projects were largely preserved even as those for wind and solar were drawn back.

For years, geothermal energy has largely been restricted to areas with significant volcanic or tectonic activity, with easily accessible heat, steam or hot water close to the Earth’s surface. Because of those limitations, large-scale geothermal projects have been geographically limited—found mainly in regions such as Iceland, New Zealand and the western United States.

However, technological advances in the oil and gas industry have opened up new opportunities for geothermal exploration.

According to Jamie Beard, founder and executive director of the geothermal nonprofit Project InnerSpace, hydraulic fracturing—which helped touch off the boom in U.S. natural gas along with horizontal drilling—can now be used to tap into the energy source in locations and at a scale that wasn’t previously possible.

Project InnerSpace, which has previously received funding from Giving Green and was just announced as a recipient of its next round of grants, is developing additional tools and technologies to tap into that new potential.

According to Beard, one of the largest barriers to geothermal development she heard from the private sector, governments and funders was an inability to know where they should drill. In response, Project InnerSpace developed GeoMap—which Beard describes as “Google Earth for geothermal.”

Unlike similar paid services that Beard says can sometimes cost millions of dollars, GeoMap is free. It allows stakeholders to utilize hundreds of layers of subsurface and surface data to analyze the expected cost of geothermal projects anywhere in the world.

“Funding entities are using it for diligence. Governments are using it to build policy. Every geothermal startup in the world uses it,” Beard says.

She thinks those advances—along with model projects the group has helped develop through its “GeoFund”—will help make geothermal energy an attractive investment even for companies that traditionally rely on fossil fuel extraction.

“How do you build a business model for geothermal that will actually attract the oil and gas industry? A business model where they will want to drill for geothermal, because it makes business sense for them to drill for geothermal?” Beard said.

“If we crack that code, you crack geothermal at scale globally.”

Some oil and gas companies have shown interest in the technology in recent years. Devon Energy invested $100 million into a Houston geothermal startup in early 2024, while BP and Chevron took part in a $40 million investment round for startup Eavor Technologies in 2021.

Still, there is likely some way to go before Beard’s vision comes to fruition. According to a 2024 report from the International Energy Agency, only about 15 percent of geothermal capacity is currently operated by oil and gas companies. And the industry has been slower to embrace geothermal compared to other clean energy investments, says the Journal of Petroleum Technology.

Next-generation nuclear fission, too, was highlighted by Green Giving’s report as a key opportunity to promote clean firm power.

Nuclear accounts for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. power supply, but building out additional capacity has been constrained by cost, Stein said.

Safety regulations put in place after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 have led to a much more complex and lengthy approval process for new nuclear projects, according to Stein. In addition, because these projects are significant undertakings, they face the same considerable regulatory hurdles that any major infrastructure project is required to undergo.

“The same reason it takes billions of dollars to build a subway in Manhattan is like the same reason it takes billions of dollars for [nuclear development],” Stein said.

But similar to geothermal energy, Giving Green sees recent technological advances in nuclear power as an opportunity to build new projects at greater speed and reduced costs than previously possible.

“The promise of these next-generation nuclear designs is that they can be more modular,” Stein said. “Learn how to build it, get it permitted, get it approved, learn how to build it really well, and then build it over and over and over.”

Giving Green’s report acknowledges the hurdles that will have to be cleared to achieve those goals. Advanced nuclear—like next-gen geothermal—is not yet a mature technology and will require sustained research, development and demonstration before it can move toward widespread and competitive deployment, the report says.

It also highlights risks about the viability of advanced nuclear, saying that the technological progress and political conditions that its future depends on are uncertain.

Beyond highlighting philanthropic opportunities to advance clean firm power, the report also says clean energy deployment of all forms, including wind and solar, need better regulatory processes—from accelerating federal permitting to modernizing the interconnection process.

Federal permitting reform, in particular, has received significant bipartisan attention in recent months—and support from industries across the energy sector.

One such legislative attempt, the SPEED Act, was introduced by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), considered the bedrock of environmental law.

Those changes would include limits on what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raise the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establish a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current six-year statute of limitations for energy projects.

However, some Democrats and environmental groups have cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) said during a September hearing for the bill.

That sentiment was echoed by critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a September press release.

Stein acknowledged those fears but sees a way forward.

“I do share those concerns that the devil is really going to be in the details,” Stein said. “I think I’ve seen some senators say, ‘If there’s going to be permitting reform, we need some legal guarantee that the administration will not just cancel renewables projects.’ And I do think that that’s something that could be built into any legislation.”

To Stein, the promise of technological advances and bipartisan support for clean firm power, plus the potential to find compromise on deploying clean power more efficiently, leaves significant room for hope despite the political climate.

“I think that despite headwinds, there’s a lot that civil society can do at all levels,” Stein said. “It is a responsibility we have to try to bridge the gap and solve problems, rather than withdrawing to our specific camps or specific places where people agree with us.

“So I kind of want to be the voice for optimism here and say, ‘Look, it’s tough times, but we can still get things done—and this is a long-term fight.’”

Cohen, the head of Clean Air Task Force, agreed.

“Climate is a marathon, not a sprint,” he said. “So this too shall pass.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205280577-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:57:30.939024

The Trump administration's return to power has unleashed an ambitious offshore energy program that dwarfs previous federal leasing initiatives. Through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the administration has mandated 36 total lease sales spanning from 2025 through 2040, representing a dramatic expansion of U.S. offshore lease sales under Trump's administration compared to the Biden era's more restrictive approach.

This comprehensive leasing framework encompasses 30 separate auctions in the newly designated Gulf of America and 6 additional sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet region. The sheer volume of acreage being offered approximately 81 million acres across both regions establishes this as the largest offshore leasing initiative in modern American history.

The economic implications are substantial, with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) implementing the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate to encourage robust industry participation. This rate, representing the lowest permissible under federal law, signals the administration's commitment to attracting maximum investment while still generating significant federal revenues from these offshore resources.

Historical data reveals that previous administrations typically conducted between 1-3 offshore lease sales annually, making Trump's program of multiple sales per year through 2040 an unprecedented commitment to domestic energy production. The timeline begins aggressively, with the first major sale, Big Beautiful Gulf 1, scheduled for December 10, 2025, just weeks after the program's announcement.

Strategic Geographic Focus Areas

Gulf of Mexico: America's Premier Offshore Energy Hub

The Gulf of America, spanning approximately 160 million acres of outer continental shelf, represents the cornerstone of Trump's offshore strategy. The inaugural Big Beautiful Gulf 1 (BBG1) sale will offer 80 million acres for development, making it one of the largest single lease offerings in federal history.

Resource assessments indicate the Gulf contains extraordinary potential:

29.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil reserves

54.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources

Existing infrastructure supporting rapid development

Proven geological formations with high success rates

The Gulf's strategic advantages extend beyond raw resource potential. Decades of development have created a mature ecosystem of pipelines, refineries, and support infrastructure that can rapidly accommodate new production. Water depths range from shallow nearshore areas to ultra-deepwater regions exceeding 10,000 feet, offering opportunities for operators with varying technical capabilities and risk tolerances.

Environmental considerations have been carefully incorporated, with specific exclusions for the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and previously withdrawn environmentally sensitive areas. The Eastern Gap region, extending beyond U.S. territorial waters, remains excluded to maintain clear jurisdictional boundaries.

Alaska's Cook Inlet: Northern Energy Frontier Development

Alaska's Cook Inlet represents a complementary northern component of the administration's strategy, with 1 million acres designated for the inaugural Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1) sale scheduled for March 2026. This marks the beginning of a six-auction series extending through 2032.

Cook Inlet's operational environment presents unique considerations:

Seasonal ice conditions requiring specialised equipment

Limited existing infrastructure compared to the Gulf

Proximity to Anchorage providing logistical advantages

Harsh weather patterns affecting operational windows

The region's resource potential, while smaller in absolute terms than the Gulf, offers strategic advantages including reduced transportation costs to West Coast markets and potential integration with trans-Alaska pipeline infrastructure. Historical production from Cook Inlet has demonstrated the area's commercial viability, though previous leasing activity had been limited under recent administrations.

Economic Incentive Structure and Industry Participation

Royalty Framework Designed for Maximum Participation

The administration's decision to implement the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate across all lease sales represents a calculated strategy to maximise industry participation while ensuring federal revenue generation. This rate structure provides several key advantages:

Competitive Global Positioning: The 12.5% rate compares favourably with international offshore leasing terms, particularly when combined with the U.S.'s stable regulatory environment and existing infrastructure. Furthermore, trump finalises Gulf oil lease plans while Norway's offshore royalty rates typically range from 20-28%, and the UK North Sea imposes rates between 10-40% depending on field characteristics and production levels.

Investment Certainty: By establishing a consistent rate across all sales through 2040, the administration provides the long-term price certainty that major oil companies require for multi-billion dollar offshore development projects. These projects typically require 5-10 years from lease acquisition to first production, making predictable fiscal terms essential.

Revenue Sharing Structure: Federal law mandates that a portion of offshore lease revenues flow to coastal states through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act and similar programs. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama receive substantial annual payments that support coastal restoration and infrastructure projects.

The revenue potential is substantial. Historical Gulf of Mexico lease sales have generated between $100 million to $9.5 billion per sale, depending on oil prices, acreage offered, and industry confidence. With oil prices currently above $70 per barrel and strong industry demand for domestic production opportunities, the 36 planned sales could generate tens of billions in federal revenues over the program's duration.

Comparison with Previous Administration Approaches

Biden vs Trump: Contrasting Energy Philosophies

The contrast between the Trump and Biden approaches to offshore leasing reflects fundamentally different energy philosophies. The Biden administration, operating under Inflation Reduction Act constraints, conducted only three offshore lease sales during its tenure, emphasising environmental protection and climate considerations over production maximisation.

Key differences include:

“Developing countries, and especially the small island states, are the least responsible for climate change.""
“All we have to do is look out our front doors to witness the impact of climate change,” he said.
The fund drew $5.5 billion in pledges on the first day of the U.N. climate summit, as Norway and France joined Brazil and Indonesia in investing.","Belem, Brazil — Officials from countries most vulnerable to global warming offered searing dispatches of life on the front line of a warming planet Friday, as world leaders gathered on the edge of the Amazon rainforest for the annual United Nations climate talks.

Ahead of Monday's official kickoff, officials have sought to build support for initiatives to protect forests and to streamline carbon markets, which seek to reduce the emissions that drive warming. But the meetings also took time to hear impassioned testimony about the harms climate change is dealing around the world.

Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin, whose country was pummeled by Hurricane Melissa, appealed to wealthier countries that produce the greatest share of the world’s emissions to support Haiti in preparing for bigger storms. Developed countries pledged $300 billion to help poor nations cope with climate shocks at last year’s summit, but the money has yet to be distributed.

“The hurricanes and the heavy rain devastated my country,” said Augustin. “Developing countries, and especially the small island states, are the least responsible for climate change.""

Kithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said rescuers in his country are still searching for scores of people missing after a deadly landslide triggered by torrential rain sent muddy water crashing into villages last week.

“A previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives,” he said. “This has now become common.”

And Kalani Kaneko, the foreign minister of the Pacific Island nation of the Marshall Islands, said his country already is living a nightmare.

“All we have to do is look out our front doors to witness the impact of climate change,” he said. “Now the sea rises, the coral dies and the fish stock leaves our shores for cooler waters.”

Time running out

Officials warn that it has become almost impossible to keep global warming below the key Paris Agreement benchmark of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).

Last year was the hottest year on record. Scientists say that every fraction of a degree of atmospheric heating unleashes longer droughts, deadlier heat waves and more intense storms.

Hurricane Melissa has made that painfully clear, said Racquel Moses, director of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator, a coalition investing in climate resilience.

“It will be much, much harder to ignore the Caribbean, to talk around the issues that are absolutely real, because we just had this experience,” said Moses, who has family in Jamaica. “The very way that we live is dependent on these negotiations going according to plan.""

Reduced summit participation hangs over talks

World leaders who were not in the room on Friday were perhaps as important as those who were.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a hoax and prioritizes fossil fuels, boycotted the summit, leaving a hole that many other world powers sought to fill.

Although China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India also skipped the conference, the officials sent in their place used the podium to revive lagging enthusiasm about the global energy transition and assure the gathering that multilateralism was not dead just because the U.S. wished it so.

Praising his country's massive installations of wind and solar power, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang promised to “accelerate the green transition in all areas.” Although China is by far the world's biggest carbon emitter, Ding made clear it was still a leader in switching to cleaner forms of energy.

“China is a country that honors its commitments,” he said.

Indian diplomat Dinesh Bahata on Friday touted his country’s expansion of renewables to half of all energy capacity, portraying the Global South as bending toward the future of affordable, clean power while political calculations trapped wealthier nations in an outdated addiction to fossil fuels.

“While developing countries take decisive climate action,” he said, “developed countries fall short.”

Others criticized that imbalance, with Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, questioning how developing nations were expected to decarbonize at a time when financial assistance for poor countries is faltering and the U.S., the world's biggest oil producer, is cashing in on heightened demand for hydrocarbons.

“We do not ask for charity, but for climate justice,” he said.

Maina Vakafua Talia, the environmental minister of the island nation of Tuvalu, at one point addressed Trump directly over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. “Mr. President, this is a shameful disregard for the rest of the world,” he said.

The White House shot back that Trump “will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Progress on forest protections and carbon markets

Attendees said they made progress on two initiatives over the past two days: Financial incentives to support endangered forests and a shared global carbon market.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was working to win support for a signature new fund that would pay 74 developing countries to better preserve their rainforests.

The fund drew $5.5 billion in pledges on the first day of the U.N. climate summit, as Norway and France joined Brazil and Indonesia in investing. Germany said Friday it would make a “considerable” commitment. The scheme eventually seeks to leverage investments into $125 billion.

Finland's President Alexander Stubb hailed the fund as a model for how to drive climate solutions.

“What we might be seeing now, according to studies, is a turn of the tide on carbon dioxide emissions,” he told The Associated Press. “This is because of financing. This is because of innovation. … That’s why I think (the fund) is a good idea.”

Also on Friday, Brazil and the European Union announced that they were joining forces with China and several other countries to create a coalition aimed at uniting the world's different emission trading systems into a single global carbon market.

A shared carbon pricing framework would motivate countries and companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by allowing those that pollute less than their assigned emission caps to sell credits to counterparts that exceed theirs. It has long been notoriously difficult to get nations on the same page about emission limits and prices.

Indigenous people eye a spot at the table

Brazil has billed this summit in the Amazonian city of Belem as uniquely inclusive of Indigenous leaders who have long been sidelined from decision-making in past climate talks despite feeling the most adverse effects of global warming.

Lula's government, which includes Brazil's first-ever Indigenous Peoples' Ministry, expects over 3,000 Indigenous delegates to participate this month as both members of civil society and negotiators. For comparison, last year's summit in Azerbaijan drew just 170 Indigenous people.

“This time, world leaders are coming Belem, to the heart of the Amazon, closer to our homes, our rivers, our territories,"" said Olivia Bisa, leader of the Chapra nation in Peru. Although Indigenous people cannot represent tribal nations in the talks, Bisa and others will have a greater role as delegates negotiating on behalf of their nation-states.

“We need to be in the room, not right outside of it,"" she said.

Their protests have also shined a light on the contradictions of host Brazil promoting itself as a defender of the Amazon rainforest. Lula's recent approval of an oil drilling project at the mouth of the Amazon river has set off demonstrations and outrage.

On Friday, outside Belem in the wider state of Para, hundreds of Indigenous people scaled cargo boats on the strategic Tapajos River to denounce separate plans for a new railway that would slice through their lands.

“This is our message to the leaders of the world,” Marília Sena, a leader of the Tupinamba nation, told reporters. ""We want people to see us who have been here for centuries, caring for the forest and the river.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87144335007-ap-25310640937115.jpg?crop=5659,3184,x0,y294&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 12:06:45.142855

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world's most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India's rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India's northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India's ethanol, but that's beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India's needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87147200007-ap-25309752249366.jpg?crop=6499,3656,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 13:01:54.666017

“Commitments like this gain traction over time,” said Mauricio Lyrio, secretary for climate, energy and environment for Brazil’s foreign ministry. “Therefore, 19 endorsements so far are an excellent result.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.
The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland.
Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.
He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year licence for Calvert Cliffs.","Baltimore-based US power utility Constellation has announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 MWe of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) as part of a state programme to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. Longer term, the company has proposed a range of new and existing nuclear investments, including a plan to work with state leaders to explore building new NPPs in Maryland.

With respect to near-term projects, Constellation President & CEO Joe Dominguez, said: “Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices.… We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.”

He added: “What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation…. Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.”

He said Constellation was “excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today”. He noted: “Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits.”

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including up to 800 MWe of battery storage capacity and more than 700 MWe (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on hydrogen fuel. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 MWe of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 MWe of new and existing nuclear projects. These include:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Centre: Relicensing the state’s only NPP to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 MWe of generation that serves more than 1.3m homes. Without licence extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036. The two pressurised water reactors (PWRs) rated at 863 MWe and 855 MWe were commissioned in 1975 and 1977.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10%, or 190 MWe, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation seeks the to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these “demand response” programmes more impactful by using AI to create a 1,000 MWe “virtual power plant” on the regional grid.

The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland. It generates approximately 40% of Maryland’s total power and a significant majority (around 87%) of the state’s clean energy. In February 2009, Calvert Cliffs set a world record for PWRs by operating 692 days non-stop. In 2008, unit 2’s capacity factor was a world-record high of 101.37%.

Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.

Previous efforts to build a third reactor at Calvert Cliffs came to nothing. Constructing a new, large-scale reactor would take “maybe 10 years from start to finish” said Mason Emnett, Constellation’s Senior Vice President for Public Policy.

Emnett said adding a third nuclear reactor to Calvert Cliffs would probably cost around $10bn. A small modular reactor (SMR) might reduce this by several billion. Making technological upgrades, which could boost output by 10%, would probably cost around $1bn.

Constellation is looking to the companies that operate data centres, for support. Emnett said Constellation is in talks with large-load customers who could sponsor upgrades at Calvert Cliffs or other sites, in exchange for pulling power from those sites. He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year licence for Calvert Cliffs.

“We talk to customers about risk-sharing arrangements, but from the customer’s perspective, it’s difficult to bear a lot of that development risk when that’s not their expertise,” Emnett said. “They’re not power developers.” He suggested that state officials could take steps to back nuclear and encourage Constellation to keep operating the facility or grow its footprint.",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/calvert-cliffs-30.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 09:19:14.218558

The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.
The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs.
“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.
States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. The bipartisan measure brought environmentalists and major business groups into rare alignment on the contentious issue of climate change and won praise across the political spectrum.

Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment.

The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming.

The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency highlights the second Trump administration's drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, even at the cost of causing disarray for the very business interests it is claiming to protect. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.”

The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement.

But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs.

With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet.

Industry groups supported the phaseout

The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the top lobbying group for the chemical industry, were among numerous business groups that supported the law and an international deal on pollutants, known as the Kigali Amendment, as wins for jobs and the environment. U.S. companies such as Chemours and Honeywell developed and produce the alternative refrigerants sold in the U.S. and around the world.

The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. Some in the industry dispute this.

In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032.

EPA now says the rule is bad for business

On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule.

“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.

Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down. “It was costing more to be able to fix that system,"" Zeldin said.

Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule, he said, vowing to “fix this mistake.”

The Food Industry Association, which represents grocery stores and suppliers, applauded the EPA plan, saying the current rule “imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.” Zeldin’s proposal “achieves the intended environmental benefits without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on the food industry,” said Leslie Sarasin, the group’s president and CEO.

Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said.

The rule's rollback sparks confusion over Trump's strategy

But the change in tack comes after industry players had already made adjustments to ensure they could meet the goals set in motion by the 2020 law.

“Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies.

Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants.

A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said.

Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.''

Delays to the transition “risk undermining and stranding U.S. manufacturing and innovation investments, while also increasing uncertainty and supply chain inefficiencies, ultimately driving up consumer costs,'' said Joe Martinko, president of Chemours’ Thermal & Specialized Solutions business.

Even with the holdup, “the transition to low-global warming potential refrigerants is well underway,'' he said.

A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said.

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive.

He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.

“Weakening the rule will confuse the market,'' he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n5yYiOJz1hsj0gRFQTeFgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/9e485f020e41f955cea8d1385ab4cb74,N,,2025-11-08 10:18:08.893326

With their cutting-edge batteries, unique platforms, and faster pace of innovation, they are challenging the U.S. and Japanese oligopolies, suggesting a future of the automotive industry where an organization’s agility, technology, and scale will matter more than its legacy.

From local manufacturer to global EV disruptor, BYD redefines the auto industry with scale, innovation, and speed

From a domestic Chinese auto manufacturer to an international disruptor, BYD’s evolution is remarkable. BYD’s new EV technology has utilized scale, its vertical integration, including battery manufacturing, and aggressive pricing, as well as the combination of mobility and technology to redefine what an automaker can be and establish itself as a major player in the global EV revolution.

BYD possesses numerous advantages compared to other companies, allowing BYD to create electric vehicles that are less limited while designing and releasing the vehicles more quickly than many legacy carmakers. The growth it has achieved throughout the years has allowed it to compete with the American and Japanese automakers that have always dominated the technology side of the industry.

How the quiet giant learned to grow and conquer the world step by step

BYD has created a structured plan for what it intends to do, which includes developing high-value, yet affordable EVs utilizing the company’s exclusive technology and using this to penetrate the market, which is primarily dominated by established automakers. Its decision to enter Japan shows its intent to compete in complex markets with high barriers to entry.

How BYD is reinventing electric vehicles with cutting-edge technology

BYD is highly valued due to its innovation across the entire stack, beyond the motors and batteries it typically covers. With its Blade LFP batteries and purpose-built EV platforms, it can outperform competitors who retrofit ICE models, resulting in lighter, cheaper, longer-range vehicle production with quicker manufacturing periods.

BYD’s upcoming ultra-compact “kei” EV vehicle series launch set for Japan is a further example of its ambition to offer an EV in both mainstream and niche markets that have been historically dominated by more entrenched market players, just like this unprecedented gasoline-free Japanese powertrain.

A clear example is BYD’s “Racco,” a dedicated electric vehicle for Japan’s stringent kei-car classification. While having a range of approximately 112 miles and certified for 100 kW fast charging, Racco applies superior EV quality to small or compact vehicles. The Racco was explicitly designed for Japan and shows that BYD is not entering the category too late.

How a single move put the U.S. and Japan on alert in the global power game

BYD’s entry into the kei-car segment in Japan suggests that now every market is up for grabs. This threatens the share of the domestic market and illustrates the limits of domestic trade protections. BYD’s global scale and supply chains will allow it to minimize tariffs and redefine the competitive space to compel the U.S. and Japan to rethink potential policies, subsidies, and manufacturing on the pages of EVs.

For American and Japanese manufacturers, the invitation is not optional: act quickly to invest in EVs, gain control of battery and software development, optimize your manufacturing and supply chains, and engage consumers in a value conversation, not just about your brand. Anything less and you may just find yourself sitting back watching an industry disruptor, such as this, take your market share, determine pricing, and establish technology standards.

The emergence shows that in the automotive space, leadership is no longer assured by being an incumbent. By utilizing technology, scale, and speed, BYD is rewriting the rules of engagement, compelling legacy vehicle manufacturers to adapt or else risk being eclipsed in an industry driven by perishable speed that sacrifices tradition in favor of speed, just like this groundbreaking innovation, connecting 100 cities.

Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit.
It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it.
That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand.
That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots.","It's been a little more than three years since Ford officially revealed the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its popular full-size pickup truck, and in that time, Ford's seen sales steadily tick up. In Q3 this year, Lightning sales were even up nearly 40%. Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit. And according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, it may soon be lights out for the Lightning.

It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it. On the one hand, it cost them a lot of money to develop, and year-over-year sales have been increasing, but on the other hand, it's only on track to sell about 30,000 Lightnings this year, which isn't very many when you're Ford, and you expect to sell more than 750,000 F-Series pickups this year. It also doesn't help that the least-expensive Lightning you can buy now starts at about $55,000, which is a lot more than the roughly $40,000 base price we were originally promised.

Now that Republicans have gotten rid of the federal tax credit, the effective cost of buying a new F-150 Lightning is even higher than it was back in September, which isn't great news at a time when Republican economic policies are also making everything more expensive. As Adam Kraushaar, owner of the Lester Glenn Auto Group, told the WSJ, ""The demand is just not there. We don't order a lot of them because we don't sell them.""

On top of that, it also didn't help that a recent fire at a supplier's factory caused an aluminum shortage that forced Ford to temporarily pause Lightning production, and we also know Ford has delayed the next-generation F-150 for at least a year, as it attempts to figure out the best way forward.

All told, Ford has reportedly lost about $13 billion on EVs since 2023, which, even in the business world, is a lot of money. That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand. If Ford had been able to convert initial interest — it allegedly received more than 200,000 reservations for the Lightning — into higher sales, the massive investment in EVs may have been worth it, but that's just not what happened.

As Ford admitted recently, the kinds of customers who are interested in EVs tend to be more interested in smaller, less expensive options. But while some of its competitors appear to be giving up on all things electric, even if Ford does kill off the F-150 Lightning, it's still working on new EVs that people might actually want (and be able to afford) to buy. Back in August, the Michigan-based automaker revealed that it had developed both a new EV platform, as well as a new production system that would allow it to build several new EVs more cheaply and might even allow it to compete with the Chinese automakers currently threatening to eat Ford's lunch.

While Ford says it plans to build several different EVs on its new platform, the first vehicle we'll see is a new truck. Except, instead of being big enough that you might think crushing children was part of the official design brief, it will be smaller and, perhaps most importantly, cheaper. According to Ford, its upcoming smaller electric truck will start at about $30,000 without any tax credits and offer as much passenger room as a Toyota RAV4, while also being just as quick as a four-cylinder Mustang.

That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots. Then again, if sales aren't high enough to justify continuing to build the Lightning, then maybe it's for the best, at least from Ford's perspective.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ford-may-soon-kill-off-the-f-150-lightning-to-focus-on-smaller-cheaper-evs/l-intro-1762524465.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:18:24.595687

“By 2025, over 60% of American farm companies are projected to adopt advanced seeds for improved sustainability.”

Introduction: The Role of American Farm Companies in 2026

In 2026, the strength and stability of the American farm company network continue to secure the nation’s place as a leader in sustainable and innovative agriculture. As the world grapples with rising food demand, unpredictable climate change, and environmental concerns, American farm companies are increasingly taking pivotal actions. These companies—ranging from leading seed producers to livestock breeders, technology service providers, and renewable energy solution suppliers—form an ecosystem that not only sustains rural communities but also sets global standards in food security and environmental stewardship.

As we look toward 2026 and beyond, the merging of innovation with tradition is more evident than ever. American seed companies, livestock genetics innovators, farmland trusts, and wind energy firms are collaborating—directly and indirectly—to ensure farms are resilient, sustainable, and equipped to meet today’s and tomorrow’s challenges.

This article offers a comprehensive look at the American agri-sector’s 2026 trajectory, spotlighting the ongoing transformation driven by advanced technologies, resource management, renewable energy integration, and data-enabled services such as those offered by Farmonaut. We’ll dive into the current state and future direction of:

American farm company restructuring and innovation

The rise of advanced seed technologies from top American seed companies

Breakthroughs in American cow breed genetics and sustainable animal agriculture

The role of American farm land trust organizations in conservation

How energy—especially from wind turbines—is being harnessed for farm sustainability

Through this exploration, we’ll clarify how American agriculture continues to lead, adapt, and set examples for a sustainable future.

The Evolution of the American Farm Company

The concept of the American farm company has transformed dramatically over the last decade. Where once farming was seen as the dominion of multi-generational families managing traditional row crops or livestock, today’s American farm company is far more diverse, professionalized, and technologically advanced. Companies now range from independent crop producers and family-owned livestock operations to vertically integrated agribusinesses, precision farming technology firms, and corporate service providers.

In 2026, the backbone of American agriculture rests on these companies’ ability to identify, adapt to, and lead innovation—all while maintaining the integrity and tradition that are characteristic of rural communities and farmland values. This balancing act revolves around clear pillars:

Resilient and adaptive seed technologies

Genetically improved livestock breeds

Land and resource conservation practices

Integration of renewable energy sources

Data-driven monitoring and operational optimization

The ability to continue thriving in an increasingly complex ecosystem is a testament to the vital role these companies play in shaping the future of the American nation and global food systems.

Key Characteristics of Today’s Leading American Farm Companies

Deep commitment to sustainability and land management for economic, social, and environmental resilience.

Adoption of advanced genetics and biotechnology in both plant and animal operations to meet market and environmental demands.

Continued integration of renewable energy and digital monitoring for lower costs, increased productivity, and lower carbon footprints.

Establishment of partnerships with farmland trusts, advocacy organizations, and tech companies to address development pressures and climate change.

With this foundation, let’s explore the crucial components of this evolving agricultural ecosystem, starting with the science behind seeds.

American Seed Companies & The Seed Science Revolution

If American agriculture is an intricate machine, seeds are its gears. American seed companies are the force driving forward resilience and productivity by developing crop varieties that are high-yielding, resilient to climate stress, and less dependent on chemical inputs.

By 2026, the adoption of advanced seeds—especially for corn, soybeans, and wheat—is nearing universal levels, with estimates showing over 60% of all U.S. farmland planted with genetically improved and climate-adaptive seeds. Seed companies have utilized molecular breeding programs, gene editing, and biotechnology to:

Enhance drought and pest resistance while still prioritizing flavor, nutrition, and quality.

Enable farmers to maintain yields despite unpredictable weather conditions.

Reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, thus supporting farmland and ecosystem health.

Case in Point: Drought-Tolerant Corn & Soybeans

American seed companies at the forefront have successfully released lines of corn and soybeans capable of using less water and still delivering strong yields, even during extended dry periods. Developments like gene-edited traits for root optimization or enhanced photosynthetic efficiency are becoming common in commercial seed catalogues.

The result? Not only are farmers less vulnerable to less predictable weather and climate volatility, but the land itself is under less pressure to deliver, reducing stress on water tables and surrounding ecosystems.

For farmers wishing to maximize the efficiency and traceability of their crops, blockchain-based traceability tools—like those provided by Farmonaut—are now an important resource. These tools ensure that every step, from seed selection to harvest, is documented and traceable, increasing transparency, food safety, and alignment with evolving marketplace demands for responsibly grown food.

Today, American farm company strategies are incomplete without the inclusion of advanced genetics, transparency, and digital traceability across the agricultural value chain.

American Cow Breed Genetics: Transforming Livestock Sustainability

Alongside crop innovation, American cow breed genetics have advanced rapidly in the past few years, further reinforcing the nation’s ability to supply the world with high-quality beef and dairy products while simultaneously respecting the need for sustainable farming practices.

Breeds like Angus, Hereford, and Holstein have been selectively bred for trait optimization across disease resistance, feed efficiency, meat yield, and milk quality. Modern American farm companies involved in cattle breeding now use genomic tools and data analytics to:

Accelerate genetic improvements across entire herds;

Ensure herds are healthier and more productive;

Reduce environmental impact by selecting for traits like lower methane production and enhanced feed-to-milk or feed-to-meat ratios.

These advances directly benefit farmers economically but also respond to the consumer demand for higher animal welfare, traceability, and quality assurance in both beef and dairy supply chains. Blockchain-based traceability—supported by platforms such as Farmonaut—enables robust verification of genetic lineage and animal welfare credentials.

“Renewable energy use on US farms is expected to increase by 35% by 2026, boosting resilient agriculture practices.”

Focus on Breed Diversity and Resilience

In 2026, American farm companies are investing in multi-trait, multi-breed herds. This means not just relying on a single cow breed, but leveraging hybrid vigor and crossbreeding for further resilience. This strategy supports continued productivity regardless of shifting disease pressures, climate influences, or consumer trends.

The benefits of these breeding programs extend beyond productivity:

Reduced disease risk through genetic diversity

Improved land use via targeted feeding and rotational grazing systems

Economic viability through premiums for certified, traceable, and high-welfare animal products

Farmland Trusts & Land Conservation: Preserving the Backbone

As America’s rural populations fluctuate and urbanization continues, American farmland trusts play an increasingly vital role in protecting agricultural lands from being lost to infrastructure development and non-farm use. These trusts work directly with farmers, municipalities, and policy makers to:

Implement conservation easements that keep land available for farming in perpetuity;

Support sustainable land management practices including cover cropping, rotational grazing, and biodiversity enhancements;

Preserve soil health, water resources, and the overall ecosystem, ensuring farming can continue sustainably for future generations.

A key part of these efforts is their focus on the triple bottom line: productivity, environmental health, and rural economic sustainability. Increasingly, American farm companies and seed companies are partnering with or taking cues from these land trusts to align their management practices with conservation priorities.

In supporting and following recommendations from trusts, companies defend the long-term economic viability of American agriculture.

Renewable Energy Integration: American Wind Turbine Companies on the Farm

The integration of renewable energy into farming operations is one of the most exciting trends for 2026. American wind turbine companies now routinely design, install, and service wind energy systems—tailored for the unique demands of large farms, ranches, and rural communities.

Wind energy is especially attractive to farmers because it allows them to:

Reduce operational costs and reliance on grid-based fossil fuels

Generate new revenue by selling surplus energy back to utilities

Decrease their farm’s overall carbon footprint and meet increasingly strict environmental standards

The complex ecosystem that is the modern American farm company is further enhanced by renewable integration. Many farms—particularly in the Midwest, Great Plains, and parts of California and Texas—are already reporting substantial energy cost savings and long-term farm resilience due to on-site wind and solar systems.

For those managing large-scale or multiple farm locations, energy integration is made more seamless with digital monitoring tools—like the real-time monitoring and carbon footprint tracking solutions available from Farmonaut.

The American Farm Bureau’s Advocacy for Resilient Agriculture

Beyond advancements in science and technology, industry organizations like the American Farm Bureau have a huge impact on maintaining the economic and social viability of American farm companies. They advocate on behalf of farmers and ranchers—crafting policy positions around issues such as:

International trade and export opportunities

Labor regulations and workforce challenges

Agricultural research funding and technological development

Rural infrastructure improvement for broadband, transportation, and energy

By serving as the unified voice of rural communities, the American Farm Bureau helps ensure that the resources and policy frameworks needed for resilient and sustainable agriculture are prioritized at state and federal levels.

Their efforts, combined with those of farm land trusts, seed companies, breed associations, tech service providers, and renewable energy companies, create a comprehensive support network for modern American farms to thrive.

Shaping the Future: 2026 Trends and Beyond in American Agriculture

As we project toward 2026 and into the next decade, several clear trends will continue shaping the landscape of the American farm company and broader agricultural sector:

Widespread adoption of advanced, resilient crop genetics – By the end of 2026, more than 70% of operational acreage is expected to be planted with high-performance, climate-tolerant seed varieties from leading American seed companies.

Next-level genomic livestock breeding – Utilization of breed-specific genomic selection, advanced crossbreeding for resilience, and blockchain-enabled traceability for animal products.

Integration of renewable energy systems – Surpassing 40% penetration for on-site wind and solar among major operations, with many reaping both cost savings and new income streams.

Expansion of digitally-enabled farm management platforms – Real-time data for every acre, cow, and kilowatt-hour consumed or produced on the farm will be accessible on any device.

Increased partnership with conservation organizations and land trusts – Enhanced collaborative conservation, land-use planning, and adoption of regenerative agricultural practices.

Heightened focus on sustainability reporting and market differentiation – Farms and companies will compete not just on yield, but on verified sustainability and traceability.

For farmers, staying competitive will not only require agility and a willingness to adopt new technologies, but also a commitment to transparent, data-driven resource management, such as through Farmonaut’s large scale farm management and satellite-based loan/insurance verification solutions.

The American agricultural ecosystem is well-positioned to meet global food needs, support rural communities, and lead on climate-adaptive practices for decades to come.

We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves.
This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.
This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market.
The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.","Louisiana’s thriving energy economy is a testament to the state and federal regulatory environments that allow it to flourish, because both balance growth with ensuring that the highest safety and environmental standards are followed to the letter of the law.

This balance affords us both residential and industrial electricity rates that are significantly lower than national averages. Yet that is not enough for the European Union, which sought to impose statutes, signed an ocean away, on American businesses — including those in Louisiana. President Trump was right to sink these efforts.

It bears remembering that most of the restrictive energy policies that have been attempted in states like California and New York were inspired by European nations like Germany and the U.K, who learned the hard way by seeing their energy prices triple and their industries fall into decline as a result.

We know better in Louisiana because energy is more than just part of our economy — it’s a defining industry for our state. The United States led the world in natural gas exports last year, with Louisianans handling over 60% of it. We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves. The energy industry employs thousands of families across the state while maintaining the highest environmental and labor standards.

This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These standards would present no concern if they were only seeking to regulate inside Europe; the issue is that the Directive is an unwelcome export of those rules to the rest of the world.

Under its language, any company with an annual revenue from the European Union market exceeding 450 million euros, or about $486 million, is affected. This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market. This overreach imposes new red tape and exposes American businesses that employ thousands of Louisianans to additional liabilities dictated by Brussels.

If this sounds familiar, the United Nations recently garnered headlines because of its International Maritime Organization’s plan to pass a “net-zero framework” that would levy a de facto carbon tax of up to $12 billion annually. This too would fall on one of our great Louisiana industries — shipping — and on everyday Louisianans because it would raise the cost of all goods moving by ships, which The Wall Street Journal called “the ultimate in taxation without representation.”

We should recognize the International Maritime Organization plan and the European Union directive for what they truly are: an attempt by other governments to force their broad restrictions on labor and environmental governance on more competitive, more sustainable American companies. If they are to succeed, we could see American growth throttled to the same degree as the Europeans, which is something we cannot risk in today’s hypercompetitive global climate, particularly in energy markets.

The stakes for Louisiana couldn’t be higher, especially with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. As one of America’s top exporters of liquefied natural gas and a provider of critical supply to Europe — which is reducing its own reliance on Russian gas — facing European mandates such as carbon neutrality and mandated “climate transition plans” risks undermining our role as a global energy leader. The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.

We can’t afford to wait and see what the impact of these regulations will be. Just look at the difference in gross domestic product growth between the European Union and the U.S. over the last two decades or so. In that time, our economy grew nearly 90%. As for the European Union, it managed only 13.5% growth. As two international economic superpowers, that stark difference in growth can be primarily explained by the European Union’s onerous regulations.

While President Trump was right to punt these rules for a year at the International Maritime Organization, there’s a way to fix this once and for all, and legislation already stands on the House and Senate to block the European Union from this extraterritorial regulation. Knowing the stakes, I urge Louisiana’s House and Senate leaders to defend the freedom of America’s businesses from European regulations. Our families, workers and energy producers shouldn’t have their futures decided by foreign bureaucrats who have no business telling Louisiana how to work.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/af/6af6c1df-29c4-4b00-b513-23e7ffb27209/68dab86a2580a.image.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 08:59:01.475535

And now for your environmental reports:

The U.S. Department of Energy just closed on a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources for a fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute that would inject over 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface —and local residents are speaking out. This type of carbon sequestration, the process of capturing and storing emissions in tanks, is touted as a win for reducing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Yet the pressurized CO2 stored in these underground tanks can escape leading to heavy metal contamination and potentially undrinkable water quality.

Wabash Valley Resources plans to use carbon capture and storage technology in its fertilizer production, one of the cheaper industries to take advantage of this process. Energy Secretary Chris Wright framed it as reducing America’s dependence on foreign fertilizer sources, saying the project relies on “American coal, American workers, and American innovation.”

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson called the project “exceptionally dangerous and risky,” arguing that the extended Terre Haute community would be exposed to significant threats to their environment, health, and water should the tanks ever be compromised. He emphasized that this project will increase toxic emissions, CO2 emissions, and is a false solution to the issue of pollution. Yet the EPA issued permits early last year allowing Wabash Valley Resources to construct wells. In fact, in early August, the EPA found that the injection and monitoring wells would have “no significant impact” on the environment. Some supporters even argue that this development would economically benefit Hoosier farmers.

But this project highlights a fundamental question in climate policy: Is carbon capture a necessary means to reduce emissions, or is it a lifeline to fossil fuel companies who let polluters keep polluting while putting communities at risk? For residents near West Terre Haute, this is about their water, their land, and who gets to decide what happens in their backyards. With construction potentially beginning soon, this issue remains an active topic of concern.

As world leaders prepare to gather in Brazil next week for the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 30, a chorus of voices are issuing an urgent call for “courageous action to protect God’s creation and people. “ Those voices are a collection of U.S. Catholic bishops and relief organizations are issuing an urgent call for meaningful commitments to climate change mitigation. The leaders are urging countries to invest in resiliency efforts, commit to bold mitigation that reduces harmful emissions, pledge recovery initiatives for vulnerable communities, and provide transparent climate finance including debt relief. This faith-based call for climate justice emphasizes that climate action surpasses environmental or even economic issues. Course-correcting climate change is an imperative that connects caring for the planet with caring for the world’s most vulnerable communities. As COP30 convenes in the Amazon, home to Earth’s largest rainforest, the question is whether world leaders will match moral urgency with concrete commitments.

New York continues to drive progress, becoming one of the first states to require that every public school student—from kindergarten through high school—learns climate science.

These climate science classes will cover what’s causing climate change, local and global impacts as well as conservation and solutions. These concepts can be taught as stand-alone courses or by weaving lessons into existing classes through an interdisciplinary approach. In the current school year, 561 districts enrolled more than 135,000 students in climate-related courses, but this new requirement sets lesson standards for everyone, no matter where you live or which school you attend.

This legislation joins similar policies in California, Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey. Across the country, this shift considers what students need to thrive as adults—not just traditional academics, but tools to understand and address the environmental challenges they’ll inherit.

The nonprofit organization Climate Central has stepped in to rescue a critical climate tracking tool that the federal government abandoned earlier this year—a NOAA database that’s been documenting the United States’ costliest weather disasters for over four decades.

During just the first six months of 2025, there have been 14 separate weather and climate disasters in the U.S., costing over $101 billion, with the Los Angeles wildfires in January becoming the costliest wildfire event on record at over $60 billion. The average number of these extreme events has surged from about three annually during the 1980s to 19 events per year over the last decade making data collection essential in order to inform preparedness and response plans. Senior climate scientist Adam Smith, who led the project under NOAA for 15 years, will now maintain the database at Climate Central.

This database serves as a tool that communities, researchers, and even insurance companies use to understand escalating climate risks and build resilience. In a time when extreme weather is becoming our new normal, having reliable data to inform our decisions has never been more critical.

Many federal tax incentives for energy-efficient home improvements — including appliance upgrades — are set to expire at the end of this year, meaning homeowners who don't act fast could miss out on thousands in savings.

The Inflation Reduction Act created a new wave of federal rebates and tax credits to help households switch to cleaner, more efficient electric appliances. But as Canary Media reported, many of these tax credits will sunset by late 2025, even though some rebate programs will continue.

That means the clock is ticking if you want to fully take advantage of everything available to you.

You could snag up to $840 in federal rebates for a new electric or induction stove. The U.S. Department of Energy's Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate Program covers new and replacement electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, and ovens — including induction models that are far safer and faster than gas.

Gas stoves release harmful methane and nitrogen dioxide, which can worsen indoor air quality and cause respiratory issues. Induction models are not only safer but also around three times more efficient than gas-based models, cooking your food even faster and saving you money on monthly energy bills.

For renters or anyone not quite ready for a kitchen overhaul, plug-in induction burners start at only around $50, offering a quick and affordable way to cook cleaner and safer in your home.

Homeowners can claim tax credits by filing IRS Form 5695 when submitting their 2025 taxes, and rebates are managed at the state or tribal level via the Department of Energy's Home Energy Rebates Portal.

Just make sure to act fast, as upgrading to an energy-efficient appliance now could mean hundreds in immediate savings and a more comfortable, pollution-free abode. With many of these federal tax credits approaching their expiration date, switching to an induction stove might just be one of the smartest, healthiest, and most cost-effective upgrades there is.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-08 07:00:16+00:00,the Guardian,Electric cars: could leasing a used EV help you afford one? - The Guardian,"Jasper Jolly, www.theguardian.com, jasper-jolly",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/nov/08/electric-cars-leasing-used-ev-secondhand,"“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker.
The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV.
Salary sacrifice The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme.
Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.
Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them.","When Anthony Santos was looking for a car to replace his Audi Q3, a diesel SUV, he felt reluctant about making the switch to an electric car.

“I was considering it, but I probably wouldn’t have,” says Santos, a sales manager at RWinvest, a property investment company in Liverpool. But when he started looking at his options the ability to lease a used electric vehicle (EV) caught his eye.

A couple of years ago someone looking for their next car would have been hard pushed to find a used EV – let alone lease one – but that is changing fast.

There are now 1m EVs on British roads, and the cars bought by early adopters are hitting the secondhand market.

Generally speaking EVs have lost value more quickly than petrol or diesel cars, which is a big problem for the owners of leasing companies, rental businesses or corporate fleets. But the flipside for consumers is that it is possible to find a cheap leasing deal.

In the second quarter of 2025, the number of used car leases in the UK rose by 166%, compared with the same period a year ago, with electric cars driving the growth, according to the latest data available from the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), a lobby group.

“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker. From about 15% of sales in 2024, used EVs now make up nearly half its business.

At Octopus EV, which is part of the UK’s largest energy supplier, the number of used EV leases has doubled in the last year.

The picture is helped by fact that big players in the leasing market, including Lloyds Banking Group’s Lex Autolease, BNP Paribas’s Arval, and the independent group Zenith, have started now offer leases on used EVs.

With the average price tag of a new electric vehicle sitting at £50,000, putting them out of reach of many Britons, in the summer the government launched a subsidy scheme. But buying secondhand makes going electric even more affordable.

Santos discovered that he could lease a lightly used Mercedes-Benz EQA without paying anything upfront. His company offered a salary sacrifice option (more on that later) via the Electric Car Scheme, which meant he could pay £360 a month for a car that would usually cost £570.

“There was no deposit – the tax benefits really made sense,” Santos says. “That’s what made me move forward with it.”

How leasing works

People who lease their cars pay a monthly fee, typically for two or three years, avoiding the need to stump up tens of thousands of pounds upfront. As well as the car, costs such as road tax, breakdown assistance, service and maintenance are often included – but typically not things such as insurance.

Leasing a used EV is a lot cheaper than buying a new one, even for vehicles in good condition that are only two or three years old. That means more expensive models can be more affordable, making it easier for people on lower incomes to cut their carbon emissions.

The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV. On a standard lease a new model costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice. Volkswagen’s ID.4 SUV similarly falls from £506 to £296 a month, a decrease of 42%.

However, not every cost will be picked up by the owner. Lessees will still have to pay damage outside fair wear and tear, and some also add an excess mileage charge. While 10p a mile may not sound like much, high-mileage drivers will have to consider whether they will face a big extra bill when they hand the car back.

Salary sacrifice

The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme. The key thing about salary sacrifice is that the cost is deducted from your pay before tax – lowering your tax bill. How much you save depends on your tax bracket: so lower-rate taxpayers save 20%, higher-rate taxpayers (salaries of £50,271 to £125,140) save 40%, and 45% above that.

Ian Hughes, the chief executive of the corporate and consumer business of Zenith Group, says salary sacrifice has been “a major foundation stone of the transition” to electric cars due to the tax advantages.

Many employers offer salary sacrifice – ranging from very small companies to household names such as HSBC, BT and Jet2, as well as a number of NHS trusts. There are usually no fees for the employee, but employers pay the scheme provider the equivalent of the tax saved from lower national insurance contributions.

Often the companies offering salary sacrifice impose conditions, such as a minimum contract length, or a gross basic salary above a certain threshold. People leasing will also have to go through a mandatory credit check, as well as affordability checks to make sure they can handle the monthly payments.

There are still options for someone whose employer does not offer a salary sacrifice scheme. Carwow’s “Leasey” leasing service, for example, offers used EVs. An electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month. That is still significantly more than the £209 offer for those able to use an employer’s scheme, but well below the £310 a month (on top of a £3,000 upfront payment) for the equivalent new model bought from Mini directly.

Gary Comerford, a consultant who runs the EV Musings podcast for electric car drivers, says his experience of leasing a used EV is “very smooth” but adds that he would not say it is flawless. He could not do a test drive before committing via Car360, although he had the option to return with no questions asked within the week. He paid a deposit of £1,200 and pays £310 a month for a 2021 Polestar 2.

“As long as you can work within your budget it’s quite easy to get a lease,” Comerford says – although he adds that limiting tax benefits to salary sacrifice is unfair to self-employed people like him.

Some optional extras can be included with the car (and can benefit from salary sacrifice tax savings), such as car insurance, home chargers, and even electricity.

At the end of the term the choice is generally to either extend your lease or hand the car back, although some companies also offer the ability to buy the car outright. Note though: early returners will probably end up paying an early termination fee (although fees for salary sacrificers are usually waived if they leave they employer through resignation, redundancy or dismissal).

If it works for you, and you meet the conditions, used leases make it much easier to drive an EV, says Zenith’s Hughes. “The very, very exciting opportunity is it lowers the price of entry from an affordability perspective,” he says. Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.

Beating depreciation

Leasing companies are not offering deals out of the goodness of their hearts. Offering used EVs helps them cope with their least favourite word: depreciation. They bought a load of electric cars a couple of years ago, only for secondhand, or “residual” prices, to drop more than expected amid slower overall demand for EVs.

Leasing companies have a large supply of rapidly depreciating vehicles, says Toby Poston, the BVRLA chief executive. They do not want to sell at a steep loss, so leasing helps solve a problem.

Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them. The industry’s experience with thousands of electric cars is that there are far fewer breakdowns, compared with equivalent petrol or diesel cars, meaning they are less likely to face huge repair bills as the vehicles age.

Hughes expects Zenith’s cars to go through two or even three drivers over eight years before they sell it on – potentially meaning no residual loss whatsoever. (Contrary to one persistent anti-EV claim, meaningful battery degradation is “just not a thing” for the average car, he says. And most EVs come with eight-year manufacturer warranties on batteries, which means leased cars would be covered.)

Without costly breakdowns to worry about there is “less potential risk” so it easier to offer leases, Poston says. At the same time, there is “overproduction of cars across the world”, he adds. “The deals you can get now are stupendous.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8457473ebcf6edf59c0f4338b362d1484c63aab2/1480_0_5555_4444/master/5555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a27e8e2ed0418e5b352baf50475b612",N,,2025-11-08 02:18:01.403592

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011.","In a rare departure from the norm, one of the three monopoly electric utilities operating in Oregon is asking state regulators for permission to lower rates for residential customers in 2026.

The reduction, though small at less than 1%, is the result of Idaho Power’s break with coal, according to recent filings with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month. Idaho Power’s request could be on the commission’s agenda in early December, according to Kandi Young, a commission spokesperson.

It’s the result of the company saving $1.3 million by ceasing operations of a coal-burning power plant in Nevada, and through lower regulatory costs since a Boardman coal plant it co-owned with Portland General Electric in eastern Oregon was fully decommissioned in recent years, the filings explain.

Idaho Power plans to end coal-burning operations at the last coal plant it owns, along with PacifiCorp, in Wyoming by 2030, and to convert the facility to burning natural gas. The company has a goal to reach a 100% “clean energy” portfolio for power by 2045, though for now that involves natural gas — almost entirely methane gas, a powerful heat-warming greenhouse gas.

“Idaho Power has a detailed resource planning process that continually seeks the least-cost, least-risk resources to serve our customers,” Jordan Rodriguez, a company spokesperson, said in an email.

The cost savings from ditching coal come as President Donald Trump and his administration fight to keep coal-burning power plants running past dates many utilities had set for decommissioning them.

Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources. And because so many coal plants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old, reviving them will needlessly cost ratepayers more than they need to pay for power. Coal is also among the primary sources of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the International Energy Agency.

In October, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a $625 million investment “to expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry,” which includes $350 million in funding to recommission or modernize existing coal-fired power plants. But in the last four years, more than 100 such plants have closed because they’re not cost-effective to operate anymore, according to researchers at the Ohio-based nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

Electricity prices have risen across the U.S. in recent years — about 13% on average since 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration — in part due to the rise of massive new users like data centers, artificial intelligence processors and bitcoin mining, as well as growing electrification across sectors. But costs have gone up more steeply in several states that rely heavily on coal, including Kentucky and West Virginia. Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.

Rising rates

Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.

Rates for residential customers of Pacific Power and Portland General Electric are up about 50% since 2020.

Officials from both companies blame rising inflation, building infrastructure for more clean energy generation and storage, increasing costs to buy power, higher insurance costs and new customer demand. Power demand from large industrial customers, such as new data centers, is up more than 34% in the last five years, while residential demand is up 5%.

“It’s not very common for a utility to request a decrease in rates, but it does happen occasionally,” said Charlotte Shuff, a spokesperson for the Citizens’ Utility Board, a watchdog group established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of utility consumers.

“What’s more common is a rate decrease after a utility requests an increase,” Shuff said.

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011. It initially asked the state’s Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise rates 27%, but was ultimately allowed a 4% increase. The company recently asked Idaho regulators to allow it to raise rates 17% on Gem State customers in 2026 for infrastructure upgrades, new energy storage facilities and wildfire prevention.

In its latest request to Oregon’s Public Utilities Commission to lower rates for Oregonians, the company said despite its savings, it will need to spend more than $500,000 on wildfire prevention work in the state in the year ahead.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/020325_intermountain_power_plant_06_720.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 06:18:16.898337

Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas)--In late July, Vietnamese automaker VinFast held a groundbreaking ceremony for a $2 billion electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing plant in Moncure, North Carolina. North Carolina and its southern neighbor, South Carolina, account for $11 billion worth of EV-related projects being tracked by Industrial Info.

Among others, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper (D) and the Vietnamese ambassador to the U.S., Nguyen Ouoc Dzung, attended the event.

The Moncure project represents the first phase of a $4 billion, two-phase investment, and ""future expansion and updates for the factory will be identified in the next phase,"" according to a Vinfast press release.

Phase 1 is expected to begin production in 2025 and entails constructing five main production areas--a body shop, general assembly, press shop, paint shop and an energy center, among other functionalities. Sitting on about 1,800 acres in Chatham County, the initial plant has an expected production capacity of 150,000 EVs per year. Clayco Construction (Chicago, Illinois) is serving as the general contractor and construction manager for the project and will begin the bidding process to select subcontractors soon, Vinfast said. The proposed $2 billion EV and battery-manufacturing expansion is in early-stage development, with the project initially expected to kick off in late 2024.

Subscribers to Industrial Info's Global Market Intelligence (GMI) Industrial Manufacturing Project Database can read detailed reports on the manufacturing plant and expansion projects.

Another project under construction in North Carolina also is the first phase of a two-phase project, from a major automaker: Toyota Motor Corporation's (NYSE:TM) (Toyota City, Japan) $1.29 billion EV battery plant in Liberty, for its hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Upon completion, which is expected in 2025, the nearly 490,000-square-foot facility would feature six production lines, including four supporting battery production for hybrid electric vehicles and two for battery electric vehicles. The proposed $2.5 billion expansion would ramp up production of EV batteries. Subscribers to Industrial Info's Industrial Manufacturing Project Database can read more information on the initial battery plant and expansion.

Meanwhile, under construction in South Carolina is Envision-AESC LLC's (Smyrna, Tennessee) $810 million grassroot EV battery plant in Florence, which kicked off in June. The 1.5 million-square-foot facility would manufacture 30 gigawatt-hours of batteries per year. Upon completion, which is expected in 2026, the facility will provide batteries to BMW's (Munich, Germany) plant in Greer, South Carolina, which is about 175 miles away.
