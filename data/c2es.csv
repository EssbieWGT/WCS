An example of this is New York’s ongoing energy crisis.
Recently codified in the 2025 New York State Energy Plan, this is a victory for common-sense practicality over inflexible ideology.
It has progressed to an inflection point where we need to ask ourselves if we should reduce emissions or keep the lights and furnaces on across New York State.

In 2026, energy, regulations and housing will continue to be issues that rise to the top of every conversation. These issues are inextricably linked and combine to create an affordability crisis that is only slated to get worse without intervention.

Steps are being taken to address these, but there is still much work to be done to create the future New Yorkers need and deserve. This November’s upcoming election will only deepen the challenges we face in our state. Many elected officials who agree with common-sense policies are not inclined to agree loudly and publicly, due to the significant pressure placed on them by small but passionate advocacy groups. This is creating policy misalignments, prioritizing what will please the loudest voices that are making headlines over the needs of all New Yorkers.

An example of this is New York’s ongoing energy crisis. We applaud Governor Kathy Hochul’s ‘all-of-the-above’ approach to energy generation, utilizing natural gas, renewables, hydroelectric and more. Recently codified in the 2025 New York State Energy Plan, this is a victory for common-sense practicality over inflexible ideology. It has become clear that the policies and attached timelines previously put in place have had a significant detrimental impact on our economy without creating meaningful change for the environment. It has progressed to an inflection point where we need to ask ourselves if we should reduce emissions or keep the lights and furnaces on across New York State.

Our state’s lack of energy is compounded with other issues that deepen the affordability crisis felt by every New Yorker. Housing has been identified as a key priority for NYS to address, but the policies in place are limiting stock and working against our goals. In our region alone, hundreds of units of housing cannot get off the ground due to a lack of power. A builder in our region recently stated that our hot real estate market is not caused by an influx of population, but rather by a regulatory environment that limits supply by disincentivizing developers from building single-family homes. This limited stock, in combination with escalation clauses, all-cash deals, waived inspections and more, is pricing working-class families out of the market. Without intervention, real estate experts expect this crisis to get worse over the next decade, with affordability concerns growing and people not having a place to call home.

Housing is far from the only issue negatively impacted by New York’s regulatory environment. Last year, Greater Rochester Chamber worked with the Business Council of New York State, New York State Economic Development Council and other partners to create the Blueprint for New York – a study that compiles and analyzes the regulatory issues across New York State that impact economic and community growth. For years, New York has been listed as one of the 3 to 5 worst states to do business in. The Blueprint provides Legislators with an opportunity to correct that and is a roadmap that was created with the voices of leaders from all corners of our state. Instead of blaming the current Governor and legislature for these issues, which have persisted for decades, it provides a pathway to cement their legacies by correcting the economic and job inhibitors that plague our state.

The process of creating this Blueprint also provides an important example that we should seek to follow to make smarter, more beneficial policies. I hope for and encourage decision makers in Albany to go out, travel our state, listen to businesses, non-for-profits, consumers and all relevant stakeholders to develop a comprehensive understanding of the issues facing our state before creating policies and legislation solely based on the loudest voices in the room.

2026 can be a transformational session for our region and state – a session that shifts the trajectory and momentum of our state. But it can only be so if we all play a role in helping to achieve these goals. Leaving out key constituencies from the process of policymaking is a recipe for disaster. CLCPA regulations and bail reform are just two examples of policies that could have received widespread support and results if all sides were included in the final decisions.

It is important to encourage our elected officials who are wary to break political party lines for fear of retribution. Our Rochester delegation has been terrific for our community – they have shown up for us, supported us and fought tirelessly for our region. Now, it is our turn to show up for them and support them in making the decisions that just make sense. Being vocal about your needs and goals is critical to ensuring that there is political support for them – especially if you never have before. This November, when you go to the polls, remember who supports you and your goals and needs and show up to vote for those people.

New York has the opportunity to be the best state. We have everything going for us, but we need to address the issues that are causing people and businesses to flee. I love living in New York. I challenge decision makers to enact policy for those like me – people who love it here, want to stay and want to come here. Including all voices instead of the loudest voices is critical to the future of our state. In 2026, let’s bring all voices to the table to enact sound policies that support families and businesses.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

The automaker has brought a 204-kilowatt rooftop solar system online atop a new expansion at its Lafayette factory. The system went into service in August 2025 and is now generating electricity for Subaru’s operations.

Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA) is the company’s only vehicle assembly plant outside Japan. It builds the gas-powered Ascent, Crosstrek, and Forester models for the North American market. Subaru’s all-electric Solterra is built in Japan.

The new solar array generates more than three times the electricity currently consumed by the plant’s expansion. That means it produces a net surplus of clean energy, which Subaru uses elsewhere at the plant, helping cut energy costs while shrinking its carbon footprint.

Subaru estimates the system will offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, roughly equivalent to the annual electricity use of 43 homes. Over its expected 30-year lifespan, the rooftop solar installation is expected to generate millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity.

The project builds on SIA’s ongoing sustainability efforts. The Lafayette plant was the first auto assembly facility in the US to achieve zero-landfill status, and Subaru says it consistently invests in technologies aimed at reducing waste, conserving resources, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

Subaru partnered with Emergent Solar Energy to design and build the system. West Lafayette-based Emergent specializes in turnkey solar and energy storage projects for manufacturers and agricultural operations throughout the state.

DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) – General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration’s push to loosen fuel-economy rules has affected the automaker’s business even more than its fast-changing trade policies.

Speaking at ‍an Automotive Press Association event ahead of this week’s Detroit auto show, Barra said the administration’s regulatory shifts, such as killing a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit and moving to roll back tailpipe-emissions rules, prompted GM to rapidly adapt its product plans.

“We had to make some fairly significant changes,” Barra said, referring to decisions to cut billions of dollars’ worth of EV ‌investments while leaning in harder to combustion-engine vehicles.

U.S. President Donald ‌Trump has championed slashing fuel economy regulations that guided the industry for years, in a push to make it easier to sell gasoline-powered cars. He also cut a $7,500 consumer tax credit on electric models in late September, causing demand to plummet.

Barra said GM still believes ​EVs eventually will take off in the U.S. as charging becomes easier and prices come down, and said GM still sees battery-powered vehicles as “the end game.”

“It ‍will take longer without the incentives, but I ​still think we’ll get there over time,” Barra said of the ​transition to being fully electric.

She reiterated that GM is developing plug-in hybrid vehicles, which ‍can run on fully electric power before the car switches to an internal combustion engine, and that the company is evaluating traditional hybrids as well. But she said GM will continue to focus more on EVs because they are a superior product for customers.

Several major automakers have pulled back from their EV ambitions, including ‍GM’s crosstown rival Ford Motor, which last month took a $19.5 billion writedown as it axed several EV programs.

GM this month said it would record a $6 billion charge to unwind ‍some electric-vehicle investments, following a $1.6 ‍billion third-quarter charge.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are ​really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what ​will ⁠be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, adding that she wants GM to ‌maintain flexibility to adjust to how regulations may shift in future administrations.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year proposed significantly reducing the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

As Colorado Public Radio’s Sam Brasch reports, the mission of Richard Nixon’s Environmental Protection Agency has shifted under President Donald Trump to something decidedly other than its original purpose when established in 1970 after the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday it will reject Colorado’s latest plan to protect air quality over wilderness areas and national parks, citing the state’s attempt to shutter coal-fired power plants.

The disapproval marks the latest example of the Trump administration using its authority to buoy the state’s struggling coal industry. Over the last decade, utilities have agreed to shutter all six of Colorado’s coal-fired power plants by 2031 due to state-level climate laws and high costs associated with maintaining the aging facilities…

In an interview with CPR News, Cyrus Western, director of EPA Region 8, said the federal government determined the state could meet federal regional haze standards without shuttering the coal plants.

“We absolutely will have clean air,” Western said. “The state did not need to shut down these coal plants to be compliant.”

If you haven’t met EPA Region 8 Director and former Wyoming state Rep. Cyrus Western, who succeeded former Democratic Colorado Rep. KC Becker in the job, he’s a Central Casting Trump appointee–best known for an insanely racist Tweet about his state’s first African-American sheriff that somehow managed to not derail Mr. Western’s political career. The Colorado Sun’s Michael Booth reports that objections from…you guessed it, the conservative stronghold of Colorado Springs over the closure of a coal plant serving the city was the pretext for the EPA’s rejection of Colorado’s clean air plan:

The EPA on Friday said the state’s haze plan “did not properly consider and explain whether the nonconsensual closure of Colorado Springs Utilities’ Nixon Unit 1 power plant would be an act of taking private property without compensation.”

Cyrus Western, the EPA’s Region 8 administrator for Colorado and surrounding states, said in an interview Friday that Colorado Springs Utilities “has made it clear” they don’t want to close Nixon as scheduled.

It’s just the latest case of the Trump administration rolling back years of progress the state of Colorado has made on our own initiative to clean up our notoriously dirty air, but this one carries a particular stench due to the use of the Environmental Protection Agency to force major pollution sources to continue polluting–an outcome so far removed from the EPA’s original mission that it seems like a parody.

But that’s how the EPA rolls in Trump’s New Golden Age.",https://www.coloradopols.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nixon-720x720-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 18:59:48.682138

Michigan Advance

Following the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to sign off on a set of contracts for DTE Energy to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center in Saline Township, Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of environmental and consumer advocacy groups have each filed a petition asking regulators to rehear the case.

During its Dec. 18 meeting, the public service commission granted DTE’s request for ex parte approval, allowing the contracts to move forward without intervention from outside organizations, which would be able to conduct legal discovery and file testimony on the contracts.

Ahead of the meeting, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and the coalition, made up of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, advocated heavily for a contested case on the matter, arguing that it would allow intervenors to ensure that DTE customers are protected from concerns like increased energy rates due to heavy energy demand from the facility.

While the Commission approved both contracts, that approval hinges on several conditions, including requirements for DTE to update its tariff structure for large-energy load customers, like data centers, and file an amended renewable energy plan to include a comparison of the resources it needs to meet the state’s requirement to provide 100% clean energy by 2040, both with and without the data center’s energy load.

The commission set a 30-day deadline for DTE to agree to the terms laid out in the Dec. 18 order.

In a statement released Friday, Nessel reiterated her disappointment in the commission’s decision to “fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” criticizing the heavy redactions of the publicly available copies of the contracts.

“This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect,” Nessel said.

Nessel’s petition for a rehearing challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts without a contested hearing. The petition also raises questions on how the conditions set by the commission would prevent DTE from passing along costs to serve the data center, which is under development by tech giant Oracle and data center developer Related Digital for use by ChatGPT-creator OpenAI.

Matt Helms, the commission’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the body looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for a rehearing, but denied any claims that they had not sufficiently reviewed the contracts.

The commission’s staff thoroughly reviewed unredacted contracts to ensure customers are protected, Helms said.

“The Commission’s order in this case recognizes the utility’s obligation to serve this customer under Michigan law while requiring the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country – protections that would not be available under existing tariffs without the Commission’s approval of these contracts,” Helms said.

Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan raised their own questions on how the conditions laid out by the commission would protect customers from increased energy rates, alongside other concerns, like how the conditions on the contracts will be enforced.

In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the contracts protect their customers from subsidizing the data center’s energy rate. The company will continue to follow the regulatory process, Lowry said.

Over the last 25 years, power companies have primarily built gas fired or renewable energy power plants, as opposed to coal fired power plants.","In 2025, the Trump administration threw its weight behind the coal industry.

“I call it beautiful clean coal,” Pres. Donald Trump said during an executive order signing on April 8, 2025. “I tell my people, never use the word coal unless you put ‘beautiful, clean’ before it. Right doc? So we call it beautiful clean coal. Beautiful clean coal.”

Trump promised to revive it from its decade plus decline, emphasizing its value as a source of power, energy security and jobs. In the spring, he signed an executive order called Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.

“We’ll streamline permitting, we will end the government bias against coal and we’re going to unlock the sweeping authorities of Defense Production Act – the Defense Production Act – to turbo charge coal mining in America. They made it impossible,” he said.

These moves were cheered on by many in Wyoming. The state produces the majority of the nation’s coal and depends on those revenues.

So, how did coal production fare in 2025?

Wyoming Public Radio’s Caitlin Tan spoke with University of Wyoming Economics Associate Professor Rob Godby. They talked at the end of 2025.

Editor’s Note: This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Cailin Tan: Rob, how did coal fare this year in 2025?

Rob Godby: This year in Wyoming, it'll be probably the second-worst year ever [in the modern mining age, which includes the Powder River Basin], after last year. It's not great by historical standards at all. We're about 60% below our height. That was about 15 years ago.

But you know, if you're looking for a little bit of an optimistic outlook, it's better than last year [2024].

We went into last year with a lot of coal sitting at coal fired power plants, so they didn't really get a big spring delivery schedule. It really dropped off in 2024, and that didn't happen in 2025.

But really, the bigger story was that natural gas prices were much higher in the last half of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, and so a lot more coal was used. Just broadly speaking, coal struggles when gas prices are lower.

But pessimists would have said, ‘Well, could it have been worse?’ I guess. And the answer is, unfortunately, yes. The long-term outlook for coal is that we just continue this secular decline over time. The curve might have flattened a little bit, in terms of the trend downward, but most analysts expect that that downward trend will continue, and really, it just comes down to cost.

It's just more expensive to run a coal fired power plant. Over the last 25 years, power companies have primarily built gas fired or renewable energy power plants, as opposed to coal fired power plants. In Wyoming, the last one was built in 2011, 2012, and that one is considered the only power plant in the country that can compete with renewable energy. It's right next to the cheapest source of coal in the country.

CT: Is that Dry Fork, near Gillette?

RB: Yeah. Dry Fork is the least cost plant in the country. The bottom line is, our energy system is evolving towards a renewable basis, with natural gas as the fossil fuel backup.

CT: Obviously, the Trump administration has made a lot of moves to try to, I guess, make coal less expensive of an industry...

RB: Yeah.

CT: …to try to deregulate. Could we see trickle effects from that over the next couple years, where it is more affordable to use coal? Or is it still just you're working against the age of power plants?

RB: That's the big problem, right? One of the things that the Trump administration has done is use these emergency orders to basically delay retirements of coal fired power plants. There's been a few power plants in the country where, literally, the operators want to shut them down, and then at the 11th hour, they've gotten this emergency order that says they can't do that.

The justification is usually some sort of grid integrity sort of argument, that we need that extra power. It is the case that demand has increased, and that does put a lot more stress on the power grid, but that has been a real challenge to keep these plants open that were getting ready to close, because they haven't seen a lot of investment in the last few years.

When you know a plant is close to retirement, it's kind of like an old car. You get to the point where you say, ‘I don't think it's worth it to put new tires on it, or to replace the brakes.’ You're just going to drive it until, really, it makes more sense to buy a brand new one.

The other big problem is the Trump administration will only be around until 2028, and then we don't know what happens after that. Given the fact that the alternatives to coal just keep getting cheaper and cheaper – natural gas, renewables, we're seeing new types of energy come onto the grid – all of those things make it more difficult to imagine a world 20 years from now that really needs coal to operate the way it does today.

The bottom line is that the Trump administration can kind of bend that curve with respect to the decline of coal, make it a little flatter. But at the end of the day, short of some major requirement to rebuild and to increase the number of coal fired power plants, the main source of demand for coal, which is power generation, [is] going to continue to decline, and as it declines, so will mining.

CT: This past fall, the Trump administration had scheduled a couple coal lease sales. They were the first in over a decade for our region. There was one in Montana and Wyoming. But the one in Montana got really low bids from companies themselves, and then the one in Wyoming was canceled shortly after.

RB: In Montana, they literally offered pennies per ton, not even pennies sometimes. Effectively, the price was, ‘Give us the coal for free, and we'll take the lease.’ That really kind of tells you what the value of coal is in the market right now. There's just really not a need for new sources of coal. There's enough existing coal out there to satisfy the demand in most cases for a long time yet.

There are a few situations where it might be beneficial to get a lease in a particular place, because it just helps you operationally. But altogether, the fact that they've had to cancel lease sales when this is such a pro coal administration tells you that even the White House can't offset markets. Markets are really the final determinant of whether coal is going to be around in the power generation market.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/79e13c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1440x756+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwpr%2Ffiles%2F201609%2FCoal.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 18:12:40.108898

GM adapts product plans due to regulatory shifts

Barra emphasizes EVs as superior product despite challenges

Automakers, including Ford, pull back from EV investments

DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration’s push to loosen fuel-economy rules has affected the automaker’s business even more than its fast-changing trade policies.

Speaking at an Automotive Press Association event ahead of this week’s Detroit auto show, Barra said the administration’s regulatory shifts, such as killing a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit and moving to roll back tailpipe-emissions rules, prompted GM to rapidly adapt its product plans.

“We had to make some fairly significant changes,” Barra said, referring to decisions to cut billions of dollars' worth of EV investments while leaning in harder to combustion-engine vehicles.

U.S. President Donald Trump has championed slashing fuel economy regulations that guided the industry for years, in a push to make it easier to sell gasoline-powered cars. He also cut a $7,500 consumer tax credit on electric models in late September, causing demand to plummet.

Barra said GM still believes EVs eventually will take off in the U.S. as charging becomes easier and prices come down, and said GM still sees battery-powered vehicles as “the end game.”

“It will take longer without the incentives, but I still think we’ll get there over time,” Barra said of the transition to being fully electric.

She reiterated that GM is developing plug-in hybrid vehicles, which can run on fully electric power before the car switches to an internal combustion engine, and that the company is evaluating traditional hybrids as well. But she said GM will continue to focus more on EVs because they are a superior product for customers.

Several major automakers have pulled back from their EV ambitions, including GM’s crosstown rival Ford Motor (F.N), opens new tab, which last month took a $19.5 billion writedown as it axed several EV programs.

GM this month said it would record a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, following a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what will be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, adding that she wants GM to maintain flexibility to adjust to how regulations may shift in future administrations.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year proposed significantly reducing, opens new tab the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

Lalitha Krishnamoorthy is vice president of AI and digital at Edmonton, Canada-based global engineering, architecture and environmental consultancy Stantec. Opinions are the author’s own.

America’s civil infrastructure is at a pivotal moment. While the rise of artificial intelligence has introduced new challenges, it also brings powerful tools and fresh opportunities to strengthen our systems. Recent surges in cyberattacks have highlighted vulnerabilities, but have also galvanized leaders to innovate and adapt, so our infrastructure remains robust and secure. AI-enabled attacks have made absolute protection impossible, meaning internal digital policies and governance are all the more critical to minimize system vulnerabilities.

American utility owners have long recognized the challenges of maintaining and modernizing the nation’s civil infrastructure systems. The highly exposed nature of electrical grids, water treatment facilities and gas lines make them prime targets for attacks. Over the last decade, there have been hundreds of reported incidents of cybercriminals and foreign actors hacking into some of America’s most vital infrastructure systems to wreak havoc and cause potential danger. Through August of 2024, cyberattacks on U.S. utilities surged by nearly 70% year over year.

AI has only proliferated more since then.

The advent of widespread, commercially available AI has created an entirely new headache for utility operators by dramatically lowering the technical savvy required to mount an attack. At the same time, utility operators now have access to advanced technologies that can both detect and defend against threats more effectively than ever before. So on one hand, hackers don’t need in-depth knowledge anymore — just a ChatGPT subscription and a Wi-Fi connection. On the other hand, it is now possible for teams to respond swiftly and intelligently to emerging risks due to AI-assisted programs democratizing security.

Updating legacy systems

Even the best protections and most advanced security systems can no longer defend against the scale of attack that AI enables. Deepfakes have proven quite capable of bypassing the knowledge-based authentication systems that banks and government agencies rely on, with the global financial sector reporting a 393% increase in deepfake-enabled phishing attacks in one year. If that’s their effort against top-tier security systems, then imagine the vulnerability of the legacy systems more often used by civil infrastructure.

This shift means security teams must move from trying to eliminate every spark to making sure that, if something does ignite, its impact is contained and recovery is swift.

Part of that is done through using properly installed firewalls and fail-safe systems. When bad actors inevitably do gain access to a system, these walls can close off their point of entry. Just because one system is exposed doesn’t mean the whole network of systems needs to go down with it.

Ironically, identifying a breach is where AI can actually help companies defend themselves. AI trained on the right usage data can leverage pattern recognition skills to detect anomalies and early warning signs of an attack. Odd or unusual user behavior, such as a user trying to access higher security information or making unusual changes to a system, can either alert IT teams or automatically isolate the affected area until security teams can assess the threat.

It’s a time-intensive, though worthwhile, security upgrade civil infrastructure teams can make. In the era of sensors and IoT systems, infrastructure’s digital footprint has expanded enormously — and with every expansion comes an increase of vulnerability. Having the ability to isolate each component is like having a gate valve on a leaking pipe; water can be shut off to the affected pipe before flooding causes even more damage.

AI governance and the role of employees

Even before an attack, improved governance and more diligent digital policies can limit the risk an organization faces. As much as limiting exposure for companies means creating internal firewalls and emergency shut-offs, it also means training and upskilling their workforce on data hygiene and AI use, including prompt engineering, detecting AI-generated phishing attempts and secure model deployment practices.

Having a workforce that understands what AI is (and what it isn’t) is vital to using AI correctly and safely. Adopting frameworks like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and conducting regular audits supports compliance and builds a culture of trust.

One of the most prominent threats organizations face as a result of AI isn’t a traditional attack per se, but rather an accidental data breach — one caused by lax policies and employee awareness. An analysis by the House Committee on Homeland Security estimated that 1 in 10 intrusions the U.S. faced in 2023 were due to improper access to credentials rather than any complex hack.

AI creates even greater potential for this sort of opportunistic breach as workers use large language models for their day-to-day tasks. Without clear policies governing AI use, the risk that sensitive data will be shared with a third-party source is significant. Workers may have little understanding of what’s happening with that data and how it could be used in the future to make the system more vulnerable. All it takes is the wrong data being pasted into a large language processor for highly sensitive information to become exposed.

Organizations need to focus on reducing damage and recovering more quickly when attacks occur. Figuring out how to integrate technologies such as voice recognition, deepfake detection and biometric recognition will be an essential part of creating safer infrastructure systems. Incorporating robust testing, continuous monitoring, and clear guidelines for responsible use will aid these technologies in enhancing security rather than introducing new vulnerabilities.

It’s not that AI shouldn’t be used in civil infrastructure. But understanding the risks to data privacy and the new vulnerabilities any new technology systems create is critical to understanding the risk. As crucial as updating legacy systems to modern standards is, minimizing the impact of human error when interacting with AI is equally vital.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support — or lack of it — for Trump “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.

The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”

Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.

Trump said in an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, last fall that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.

Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”

The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.

“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://www.therepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/preview-3047.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:00:14.481750

A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

At Monday’s hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

This date marks ten years since the 2016 Lautenberg amendments, which imposed a 10-year limit on most TSCA confidentiality claims unless they are affirmatively renewed. As a result, EPA anticipates a continuous, rolling ""CBI sunset"" process that could affect several thousand submissions between mid-2026 and the end of 2027. See 91 Fed. Reg. 371 (Jan. 6, 2026).

Under the amended law, companies must reassert and resubstantiate their CBI claims before the 10-year deadline to maintain protection. Congress designed this requirement to ensure that only information that still genuinely warrants confidential treatment remains protected, and to prevent outdated or unnecessary secrecy. A likely outcome of this review process is that more chemical information previously protected as confidential will eventually become publicly available if claims are not renewed or cannot be justified.

EPA is developing new processes and information technology tools within its Central Data Exchange (CDX) system to manage the anticipated surge in resubstantiation requests. The agency plans to post public lists of TSCA submissions with expiring CBI claims on its TSCA CBI website and to provide at least 60 days' notice to affected companies, primarily through CDX notifications and related communications. EPA has acknowledged the operational challenges of compiling expiring claims, issuing notices, and reviewing extension requests, particularly in light of staffing losses and recent government shutdowns.

Nevertheless, to extend a CBI claim, companies must submit a substantiated extension request electronically through CDX no later than 30 days before the claim's expiration. These requests must include updated certifications and detailed justification demonstrating the continued need for confidentiality, consistent with TSCA and EPA's regulations. EPA will review each request and either grant or deny the extension, which may last for up to an additional 10 years. If a company fails to submit a timely and complete extension request, EPA is no longer required to protect the information from disclosure. In such cases, the previously confidential information may be made public without further notice to the submitter. Substantiation requirements are provided in 40 C.F.R. § 703.5(a) and (b). Rules identifying information not subject to either routine substantiation requirements or the 10-year expiration under TSCA section 14(e) can be found in 40 C.F.R. § 703.5(b)(5).

If EPA determines that a CBI claim should be denied and intends to disclose the information, it must provide the submitter with at least 30 days' advance notice. This notice affords the submitter a final opportunity to defend the confidentiality claim or submit additional substantiation before the information is made public. If this process does not resolve the issue, the claimant may pursue other remedies, including filing a complaint in federal court to prevent disclosure.

EPA is advising companies to begin preparing well in advance by reviewing TSCA submissions made on or after June 22, 2016, inventorying existing CBI claims, and assessing whether confidentiality is still necessary. Regulated entities should also ensure that their CDX accounts and contact information are current so they receive all required notices. Early preparation, familiarity with EPA guidance, and internal planning will be critical to managing the demands of the TSCA CBI sunset program and avoiding unintended public disclosure. The consequences of inaction are therefore significant, particularly for companies with multiple or high-value CBI claims.

“Just flying into Jamaica, you could look down and see that there was no vegetation left on any of the trees, roofs were blown off houses, and debris was everywhere,” said Medved, director-safety and security officer at the Fredericksburg, Virginia-based co-op.

“One child told us that the winds were so strong during the hurricane that it sounded like a lion, and it felt like he was awake in a nightmare.”

Hurricane Melissa was one of the most intense storms ever to hit Jamaica, killing 45 people as it pounded the small island with flooding rains and sustained winds of 185 mph at its peak. The hurricane, which made landfall Oct. 28, destroyed an estimated 75% of the nation’s electrical infrastructure and left most residents without running water as electric-powered pumping stations and treatment plants stopped working.

Jamaica Public Service Company reached out to NRECA International for help, and Medved and 10 other lineworkers from five electric cooperatives throughout the U.S. went to Jamaica from Dec. 1-19 to help restore power to the Discovery Bay area in Saint Anne Parish on the island’s north coast.

In addition to Rappahannock, volunteers came from Choptank Electric Cooperative in Denton, Maryland; First Electric Cooperative in Jacksonville, Arkansas; Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative in Palmyra, Missouri; and Steele-Waseca Co-op Electric in Owatonna, Minnesota.

Another team, with lineworkers from Missouri, is working to restore power to more homes, schools and small businesses in Jamaica this month.

Mike Malandro, president and CEO of Choptank, said it was an easy decision to send four lineworkers to Jamaica when they asked to go.

“If this was happening to us, I would hope that someone would send their crews to help,” he said.

Casey Butler, a chief lineman at Choptank, said he’d never seen people go so long without power after a disaster. He and Medved both volunteered in Jamaica in 2024 after Hurricane Beryl, but the damage was not as severe.

Despite more than a month without electricity, people were incredibly positive, breaking into cheers when the lights came back on anywhere, Butler said.

“In the United States, if the power is out for a day, you know people are going to be aggravated,” he said. “But the Jamaican people were super grateful for what we were doing. You’re not going to break Jamaica; people there were always in good spirits.”

Discovery Bay resident Dyane Reynolds was ecstatic at the thought of getting the power back on in her neighborhood.

“Oh my God, we’re going to have cold water … we’re going to have the [washing machine], we’re going to have the TV, we’re going to have everything we need to be comfortable again, to be back to normal.”

Bradie Boothe said he’d been spending about 4,000 Jamaican dollars—a little more than $25 in U.S. currency—every two days to pay for gas for a generator to power his home after the storm. He had to dip into his savings to fuel the generator since both he and his wife worked in the tourism industry, which came to an abrupt halt after the hurricane. There are so few visitors now that the volunteer lineworkers slept in a vacant hotel.

“Having reliable power back is a gamechanger for everybody,” Boothe said. “Petro has been so expensive. The return of power is a huge relief on everybody’s pocket.”

One of the biggest challenges for the volunteer lineworkers was patching electric infrastructure back together without a fleet of bucket trucks or other standard equipment and supplies. Jamaica Public Service had a bucket truck that they used at times, but most of the work involved climbing poles.

“It shows you can do a lot with almost nothing, using material from poles blown down on the ground,” said Jeff Thomas Jr., a chief lineman at Choptank. “We did a lot of recycling of materials and wire.”

Local residents pitched in by loaning the volunteers their extension ladders and bringing them jerk chicken and other local delicacies for lunch.

Calvin Jackson, a lead lineman at Rappahannock, had a tiny helper—a little boy, 3 or 4 years old, who came out of his house with his dad to watch the linemen work.

“He had his own little hard hat and plastic hammer, and he grabbed my hand,” Jackson said, chuckling. “He was going to work with me that day.”

Dean Samuel Jr., a Choptank serviceman, said he was impressed by how residents patched their partial roofs back together as best they could. They even invited neighbors to move in with them if the neighbors’ homes were in worse shape, he said.

“They made it work,” Samuel said.

The Jamaicans’ resiliency inspired the volunteers, said Jordan Watson, a journeyman lineworker for Choptank.

“It makes you want to work that much harder and put in the effort to get power back on for as many people as possible,” he said. “We estimated that we turned on power to about 800 to 1,200 meters in three weeks. We put a little dent in the big picture. If you can get one meter on, you’re changing people’s lives.”

The rate increase would cause that to go up $6,000 a month, or $72,000 a year, Sloan said.","This story was originally published by WEKU on Jan. 12, 2026.

Kentucky Power has offered a settlement to state regulators for its rate increase proposal, according to a series of filings Friday.

Kentucky Power proposed a rate increase of about 15% to the Kentucky Public Service Commission to take effect this year.

After hearing public pushback in three hearings in its service territory, it has proposed a smaller increase of 12%. The company will use deferred tax liabilities to reduce the increase further for two years.

With the tax deferrals, customers would see an 8% increase over current rates this year and a 9% increase next year.

In a statement, Kentucky Power spokeswoman Sarah Lynch said the company is “committed to balancing affordability with the investments needed to keep power reliable for eastern Kentucky.”

The Kentucky commission is supposed to hear the evidence in the case this week, starting Tuesday.

In one of its Friday filings, Kentucky Power asked the three-member commission to recess the hearing after public comments Tuesday to allow them more time to consider the settlement.

Kentucky Power asked the commission to approve its settlement agreement by March 1.

Lauren Adams, communications director for Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, noted that her office was not a party to the settlement.

“We will encourage the PSC to reject any rate increase in this matter,” she said.

On Dec. 30, the PSC approved Kentucky Power’s application to continue its 50% ownership of the Mitchell coal plant in West Virginia beyond 2028. The commission denied that request in 2021. Electricity customers will pay, on average, $2.33 more each month for those costs.

The company has said it will need to replace one of Mitchell’s concrete cooling towers in the next few years. It has not disclosed the estimated cost, citing confidentiality. It will need to seek approval from the PSC in Kentucky and West Virginia to recover the cost from customers.

On Thursday evening in Ashland, about 150 people gathered at the Ashland Transportation Center, a converted railroad freight station, to listen to residents and local officials testify to the PSC commissioners.

Many residents testified of the hardship their electricity bills have created for their families.

Local officials, including Louisa Mayor Harold Sloan, asked the commission to consider what would happen to water and sewer rates if the increase were approved.

He said the small city spends $40,000 a month on electricity for its water and sewer pumps. The rate increase would cause that to go up $6,000 a month, or $72,000 a year, Sloan said. Those additional costs would be passed on to residents who also would pay more for their electricity.

“That’s my concern with this tonight. What this will do to the water and sewer rates for our same customers, the same people that are here, can’t afford this,” he said. “That means our residents are hit twice, first through the increased electric bills, and then again through the increased water and wastewater rates.”

Louisa, with about 2,700 residents, is about 30 miles south of Ashland, where Kentucky Power is headquartered.

Until 2015, Kentucky Power generated electricity from coal at the Big Sandy plant in Louisa. That year, it shut down one of the plant’s two units and converted the other one to natural gas. It also purchased its 50% share in the Mitchell plant at the same time.

Adam Rice, a representative from the office of U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers spoke after Sloan. As in other public hearings on the matter, Rice blamed the Obama administration’s “war on coal” for the Big Sandy retirement.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011226_Ashland-KY-residents-at-PSC-meeting_CurtisTate_WEKU.webp,N,,2026-01-12 18:12:50.185161

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" stated Murphy.","Fresh survey results lead EVs for All America to argue that the once-white-hot partisan divide around electric vehicles is cooling, even as the center of gravity in consumer concerns moves from “culture war” frames to jobs, China, and affordability. The organization previewed the findings in a news release.

The organization's report, ‘Fixing America’s Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress,’ tracks national polling of US auto consumers from November 2023 through November 2025 and finds that Republican resistance to EVs has eased by 20 points over three years. At the same time, the organization says the end of federal consumer EV subsidies is dampening near-term demand, and that multifamily-home charging remains an untapped lever for growth.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" stated EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The data also highlight sharply polarized views of Elon Musk and Tesla, and growing openness among Americans under 45 to buying Chinese-made vehicles—trendlines with strategic implications for automakers and policymakers alike.

Inside the new report’s findings

EVs for All America’s latest survey series (600 registered voters each November from 2023 through 2025 in households earning $50,000+, plus targeted October 2024 and October 2025 samples) surfaces several notable through-lines:

The state strategy in a federal pause

EVs for All America urges states to lean in while federal support recedes, noting that roughly 80 percent of EVs are sold in just 15 states and that positive word of mouth in high-penetration markets helps pull in the next wave of buyers. State tools are already moving the needle: Rebates, utility-managed charging programs, right-to-charge laws for multifamily properties, and streamlined permitting can partially substitute for federal demand supports.

One practical lever in the near term is enabling overnight Level 2 charging in apartments and condos. Residential charging equipment may qualify for credits that can offset installation costs when placed in service before mid-2026, helping multifamily properties accelerate deployments.

Affordability, infrastructure, and the next two years

As of January 2026, the realities facing EV shoppers diverge by region. In states with robust incentives and denser charging networks, word of mouth and test-drive exposure continue to convert fence-sitters. Elsewhere, the combination of higher perceived upfront cost, financing conditions, and limited home charging—especially for renters—keeps demand choppy. Stabilizers that can soften the “post-subsidy” drag include the shift to lower-cost chemistries such as LFP in entry trims, more aggressive pricing and trim mixes, and a stronger focus on the used-EV market, where younger buyers are most price-sensitive.

If multifamily charging scales, used-EV financing matures, and the $25,000–$35,000 segment fills out with compelling products, the next leg of adoption can proceed even in a high-rate environment. The report’s generational finding—that under-45 consumers are broadly open to EVs, and more open than older cohorts to Chinese-made vehicles—implies that the contest for the next million US EV buyers will pivot less on ideology and more on price, software features, and convenience.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" stated Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs.""

Two immediate signals are worth monitoring in the near term. First, whether state budget cycles in leading EV markets expand rebates or accelerate right-to-charge requirements for multifamily properties, key to unlocking urban and suburban demand.

Second, the pace of local charging deployment aided by remaining. Both will influence whether performance-and-value messaging can overcome the loss of federal purchase incentives in 2026.

Bottom line

The partisan temperature around EVs seems to be coming down, a welcome development, if true. However, one could argue that the damage is already done: The GOP's winning 2024 presidential candidate and congressional allies spent much of 2025 taking measures widely recognized as slowing US EV adoption.

In any case, with federal consumer incentives curtailed or ended by late 2025 and rules in flux, it will be practicalities—price, charging access, and domestic industrial strength—as much as politics that will decide the pace of adoption in 2026. If state policies, OEM pricing, and community charging scale in tandem, the perceived thaw in attitudes could translate into real sales momentum. If not, the market will continue to drift—and younger buyers’ openness to Chinese brands could evolve from an attitudinal finding into a competitive reality for the US auto industry.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt71d32a5e409deb68/686ea32b4a604a089a44e0ec/Trump-OBBBA-2223602335.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-12 17:00:34.892814

,North Carolina American Energy ,2026-01-12 21:14:50+00:00,WCBD News 2,Energy developers head to court as Trump says the US 'will not approve any windmills',"JENNIFER McDERMOTT, Associated Press, JENNIFER McDERMOTT, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.counton2.com/news/national-news/ap-energy-developers-head-to-court-as-trump-says-the-us-will-not-approve-any-windmills/,"Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.
We will not approve any windmills in this country.” The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

At Monday’s hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.","XCF is advancing its long-term growth strategy with the development of its SAF production platform, beginning with the planned construction of New Rise Reno 2.

Bank of America has been engaged to assist XCF in structuring potential debt financing for the project.

XCF is positioned for growth in a rapidly expanding SAF market projected to exceed $25 billion by 2030 and $250 billion by 2050.

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a leading innovator in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), announced today that it is evaluating financing options to support the next phase of its long-term growth strategy: the construction of its New Rise Reno 2 facility (“New Rise 2”).

If constructed, New Rise 2 is expected to enable XCF to expand its SAF and renewable fuel platform and aligns with its recently signed non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with global energy and commodities group BGN INT US LLC (“BGN”). As contemplated by the MOU, subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement, XCF and BGN intend to jointly develop global distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic markets.

XCF has engaged Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) to assist in structuring potential debt financing, which may qualify for certain export credit agency programs. There can be no assurance that any financing transaction will be completed or on what terms.

The global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion by 2030, with demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons, driven by regulatory mandates, airline decarbonization targets, and growing investor interest in low-carbon fuels. Longer term, the SAF market could exceed $250 billion by 2050 if decarbonization targets are achieved.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

“We look forward to working with Bank of America as we evaluate a range of financing options to support the next phase of our SAF production expansion at New Rise Reno 2 and advance our broader mission to decarbonize the aviation industry. With governments and airlines worldwide raising their sustainability commitments, expanding SAF production has never been more critical. Meeting the decarbonization targets of tomorrow requires making thoughtful, strategic investments today.”

Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, has a permitted nameplate production capacity of 38 million gallons per year, positioning XCF as an early mover among large-scale SAF producers in North America.

The EPA plans to finalize its proposal to repeal its scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, called the endangerment finding. Such a move would remove within days the legal foundation that underpins all major climate regulations.

Reversal of the ""endangerment finding"" would gut one of the most consequential federal standards that had enabled the U.S. to tackle climate change by regulating vehicles, industries, and energy-producing facilities that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Environmental groups have said that the scientific finding made in 2009 is even less in dispute today and should be left intact, with vehicle emission rules Washington's biggest tool to combat climate change.

President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and global efforts to reduce emissions a ""con job.""

“The science establishing harm to human health and the environment from global warming emissions was evident in 2009 and it’s even more undeniable today,"" said Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Sommers said API believes that a separate endangerment finding for stationary sources should remain in place, which would require the EPA to regulate the potent greenhouse gas called methane from the oil and gas sector. The industry supports that rule.

The EPA has delayed by 18 months implementation of former President Joe Biden's methane rules.

""We were appreciative of the delays that EPA announced last year, and what we're doing now is working with them on crafting durable rules that we think are common sense and provide the flexibility needed to maintain production levels while still reducing emissions and incentivizing continued innovation in this space,"" API's senior vice president for regulatory affairs Dustin Meyer said.

RED BANK, NJ — Business Facilities is pleased to name North Carolina as its 2025 State of the Year. This annual award presented by Business Facilities for nearly two decades recognizes a state for its successful business climate and economic development growth in the previous year. The evaluation conducted by the editorial team focuses on significant factors impacting corporate relocation and expansion decisions. This marks the third time Business Facilities has recognized North Carolina, with the state selected as 2020 State of the Year and 2022 State of the Year.

In its evaluation for 2025 State of the Year, Business Facilities considered conditions related to education and workforce, business incentives, infrastructure, quality of life, and business attraction and retention investments. When it comes to workforce, North Carolina saw a record year — under Governor Josh Stein, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC) more than 33,000 job commitments were announced through November 2025.

Capital investments from new and expanding businesses across the state also reached significant levels in the past year. From aerospace to life sciences and from data centers to rare-earth supply chains, North Carolina’s advantages for business continued to shine in 2025 — attracting nearly $23 billion in overall project investment across 47 counties between January and November 2025.

Says Business Facilities Editorial Director Anne Cosgrove, “From JetZero choosing Greensboro, NC at the Piedmont Triad International Airport grounds for the site of its first commercial airplane manufacturing facility to biotech firm Genentech building a manufacturing plant in Wake County, the state’s economic development infrastructure supports the growth of new and existing companies. Emerging supply chains are being cultivated here as well. One example is Vulcan Elements, a manufacturer of rare-earth magnets locating in Johnston County for its rare-earth magnets facility with plans to invest nearly $1 billion and create 1,000 jobs.”

Opportunity-Rich States: 15 With Momentum

As part of the Business Facilities 2025 State of the Year evaluations, states with notable programs and successes are highlighted as 2025 Opportunity-Rich States. “As business leaders and site selectors faced uncertainty throughout 2025 amidst an already evolving site selection landscape, these states are highlighted for their business-friendly environments, with assets and incentives to meet the needs of those businesses,” says Cosgrove.

Across all three bills, House appropriators rejected the administration’s proposed deep cuts and substituted a more conventional spending plan.
That level is below FY2024 enacted funding of about $41.3 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of about $43.4 billion, both of which were carried forward under a full-year continuing resolution.
The National Park Service would see a moderate reduction from current levels, not the 37 percent cut included in the White House request.
The Justice Department Inspector General was funded at $139 million, roughly 43 percent above the administration’s request—an unmistakable signal about oversight priorities.","The House did something noteworthy last week. It passed three full-year FY2026 spending bills that look very little like the administration’s budget request.

These bills are not law yet. The Senate still has to act. But this is no longer just a committee marker. The House passed the measures with overwhelming bipartisan margins, which tells us something useful about where Congress appears willing to assert itself.

The package covers three of the twelve annual appropriations bills. One funds Interior and Environment, including most of the Department of the Interior, public lands agencies, EPA, and the National Park Service. Another funds Energy and Water, covering the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and federal water and power infrastructure. The third funds Commerce, Justice, and Science, from economic data and weather forecasting to law enforcement, courts, and basic scientific research.

Across all three bills, House appropriators rejected the administration’s proposed deep cuts and substituted a more conventional spending plan. The differences are not subtle.

The Interior and Environment bill provides $38.6 billion in discretionary budget authority, about $9.5 billion—or roughly 33 percent—above the administration’s request. That level is below FY2024 enacted funding of about $41.3 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of about $43.4 billion, both of which were carried forward under a full-year continuing resolution. The Energy and Water bill provides $58.0 billion, more than $3.5 billion above the administration’s request and roughly in line with FY2024 and FY2025 enacted levels. Commerce, Justice, and Science comes in at $81.3 billion, roughly $17 billion—or about 26 percent—above what the White House proposed, but below FY2024 enacted funding of $83.5 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of $82.5 billion.

Those toplines are reinforced by specific programmatic choices. EPA would face a 4 percent cut, or about $320 million, rather than the more than $4 billion reduction proposed by the administration. The National Park Service would see a moderate reduction from current levels, not the 37 percent cut included in the White House request.

Congress didn’t just protect funding. It also redirected it. Trade agencies received notable increases, including an 18 percent boost for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and a 23 percent increase for the Commerce Department office responsible for export controls aimed at China and other countries. The Justice Department Inspector General was funded at $139 million, roughly 43 percent above the administration’s request—an unmistakable signal about oversight priorities.

Taken together, this is not a spending spree. It is a refusal to implement the administration’s budget as written. That distinction matters in the current context. Over the past year, appropriations have increasingly been treated as provisional. Funds approved by Congress have been delayed or slow-walked through impoundments. Obligations have been pushed past the point where programs can operate as intended. Rescissions have been proposed long after spending decisions were made, sometimes structured to expire if Congress does not act, effectively daring lawmakers to intervene or accept cuts by default.

Seen in that light, these bills look less like generosity and more like self-defense. When appropriators specify funding levels program by program and reject sweeping reductions, they limit how much room exists for quiet rewrites later.

The hardest tests are still ahead. Defense and Labor-HHS-Education—nearly 70 percent of discretionary spending—remain unresolved. And even if Congress finishes the job, it will still have to enforce it. Appropriations only matter if Congress is willing to respond when they are ignored.

For now, this package is best read as a signal. Congress is reminding the executive branch—and itself—that writing the check is not a suggestion. Whether that reminder sticks will be one of the real tests of 2026.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Congress-1024x536.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:00:48.748862

According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.
Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.
Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.
“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said.","Iowa produced 4.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025 — a figure consistent with the past two years and one that Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says could be higher if Iowa had access to carbon sequestration technologies.

The call for carbon capture and sequestration comes from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association at the start of Iowa’s 2026 legislative session, where debate around property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines are set to be top priority.

A proposed carbon sequestration pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions would connect to Iowa ethanol plants and transport their sequestered carbon dioxide to an underground storage site. This would allow ethanol plants to participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol industry to produce things like sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel, but the project has been contested in legal and legislative settings by landowners who feel the pipeline is not a public use worthy of the power of eminent domain.

Under eminent domain, unwilling landowners can be forced to accept easements on their property at a price set by a county commission for projects considered in the public interest.

Nationally, the U.S. produced 16.4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025, according to the national Renewable Fuels Association. IRFA pointed out in a news release that while national ethanol production has increased annually over the past five years, Iowa production has remained “stagnant” at 4.6 billion gallons annually since 2023.

While Iowa remains the top ethanol producing state in the country, in 2025 the Hawkeye State produced 28% of the nation’s ethanol supply, which is less than the share it produced in 2023 and 2024 when Iowa accounted for roughly 30% of the national share, according to the association.

Figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that increased ethanol production in the country has been driven primarily by a rise in ethanol exports. In March 2025, fuel ethanol demand for the month was equivalent to about 465 million bushels of corn, which was a 60-million bushel increase in monthly demand from 10 years prior.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said Iowa is “behind in the race” as other states work to take advantage of incentives and market benefits of ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Investment dollars flow to areas with a perceived competitive advantage,” Shaw said in a news release. “The states attracting significant investment have one thing in common – the ability to sequester carbon either locally or via pipeline infrastructure.”

In addition to expanded markets, low carbon ethanol fuel producers and CO2 transportation pipelines are eligible for federal tax credits known as 45Z and 45Q.

According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.

Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Iowa continues to have a significant lead over other states in ethanol production capacity with nearly double the number of plants in Nebraska.

“There is no reason why Iowa plants won’t grow in the near future if we maintain their access to the tools and technologies to compete,” Shaw said.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year that restricted carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to utilize eminent domain in the state, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds.

Landowners opposing the pipeline project plan to lobby, beginning Tuesday, for similar legislation this year to limit the project’s ability to take land for its construction against landowner wishes.

The Summit pipeline has also been affected by a ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines through South Dakota. Recent filings from the company indicate it may change paths, pending state approval, to avoid crossing through South Dakota.

Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said. “IRFA will continue to support legislation that enhances landowner rights, streamlines the permitting process, and maintains a viable path forward for CCS. Our future depends on it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/adkins-ethanol-plant-lena-IL-_-Getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:12:58.097215

We and our partner organizations provide critically important, data-driven programs that cut red tape, provide affordable energy choices, and expand American energy dominance nationally.","(Washington, D.C. – January 12, 2026) The U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia ruled today that the Trump administration violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements when it cancelled millions of dollars in federal grants for clean, affordable energy and transportation projects based on the states in which the grantees were located. The projects would save American families money, reduce air pollution and protect people’s health.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024 … Defendants offer no explanation for how their purposeful segregation of grantees based on their electoral support for President Trump rationally advances their stated government interest,” the court’s decision states. “Plaintiffs … put it best: ‘There’s no federal funding exception to the Equal Protection Clause.’” (Opinion, pages 10, 12, 13)

The City of St. Paul, Elevate Energy, Environmental Defense Fund, Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Plug In America, and the Southeast Community Organization, filed a lawsuit after they lost grants, or partnered with groups that lost grants, because the administration targeted the states in which they were located. The lawsuit challenged the cancellation of those Congressionally appropriated Department of Energy grants for reasons the administration clearly and publicly stated were to punish certain states. On October 1st, U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russel Vought announced the 16 states where cancellations would occur. The next day, more details emerged showing $7.5 billion in cancelled grants and awards from 315 projects – every single one of which was to a grantee located in a state that voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election and with two Senators who caucus with the Democratic party.

The coalition lawsuit argued that the administration’s action violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment – which guarantees Americans equal protection under the law. Today the court agreed.

QUOTES

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law. The administration’s damaging actions violated the U.S. Constitution, foundational American values, and basic decency, and it imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives.” – Vickie Patton, General Counsel, Environmental Defense Fund

“The court ruling in favor of Elevate is a step toward keeping clean energy affordable and advancing initiatives nationwide. By protecting these grants, we can continue to create jobs, lower energy costs, and expand access to clean energy, bringing us closer to a cleaner, stronger, and more sustainable future. This decision is for the communities across the country who should not have to choose between paying their energy bills and feeding their families. Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible.” – Dr. Anne Evens, CEO, Elevate Energy

Our industry focus results in comprehensive state-of-the-art knowledge of the commercial, legal and governmental challenges faced by our clients and enables us to provide innovative solutions to facilitate transactions and resolve disputes.

Our Beginning. On November 1, 1945, two brothers, Searcy and Fentress Bracewell, just home from their World War II service, joined their father, J. S. Bracewell, and another leading Houston lawyer to open the doors of a new Houston law firm. From the beginning, the Bracewells understood that for their firm to succeed they must maintain a relentless focus on professional excellence. As they dreamed of building a larger firm, they also understood that the firm’s roots must be deeply embedded in a culture emphasizing personal relationships and teamwork. Finally, based on J. S. Bracewell’s great success as a statewide and community leader before the war, the Bracewells believed that a commitment to public and community service should be a key component of their firm. More than seventy years later, this commitment to professional excellence, to personal relationships and teamwork, and to public and community service remain the cornerstones of our partnership.

Born in the Courtroom. Our reputation for professional excellence began in the courtroom. J. S. Bracewell was well known as a fierce and relentless litigator, and the post-war era saw the firm assume and extend that reputation. From that beginning, our reputation for professional excellence grew from insurance defense to labor, tax, condemnation and business litigation. In the 1960s and early 1970s, as the growing Texas economy began to attract business enterprises from all over the world, as well as financing from money center banks, our litigation practice evolved to the representation of stakeholders in large-scale commercial disputes.

Development of our Business Practice. As the energy and financial services sectors grew dramatically in Texas in the 1970s, the firm’s reputation for professional excellence attracted clients focused on transactional and commercial matters. This inspired firm leaders to significantly expand the firm’s transactional practice, and in the mid-1970s the firm began adding like-minded partners focused on corporate transactions and bank finance. Our firm’s reputation in the courtroom was soon matched by our growing reputation for handling major M&A transactions and financings.",https://natlawreview.com/themes/custom/nlr_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:25.122046

This area is separated from the food bank by a floor to ceiling “wall” constructed of chain-link fence covered with poly sheeting.
The EPA requested consent to access the property shortly after on May 27, 2025.","The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lead a cleanup effort at a Yuma, Arizona, warehouse after the Yuma Community Food Bank was made aware of electronic waste housed in its facility.

The warehouse, located at 2404 E. 24th St. in Yuma, houses 3.92 million pounds of abandoned material, created from 2012 to 2015 by a glass recycling company, which the EPA names as Down Management LLC, also known as Attan Recycling Corporation (Dow/Attan), in a document.

The EPA has assured the city that the food bank will remain unaffected and will continue to serve the community throughout the cleanup project. The EPA also stated in a fact sheet about the project that “this material is sealed in boxes and held in an area of the warehouse separate from the food bank.”

The glass recycling company abandoned TV and computer screens with glass vacuum cathode ray tubes (CRTs). The EPA says the glass and parts from these devices hold hazardous material, mainly lead. The agency will properly dispose of the waste and debris in a certified landfill.

Atlas Technical Consultants LLC performed a Phase 1 environmental site assessment at the request of the food bank.

According to the site assessment document provided through the EPA’s admininistrative record, the area of the building was contaminated by Dow/Attan’s improper CRT destruction and materials management between 2012 through 2015. This area is separated from the food bank by a floor to ceiling “wall” constructed of chain-link fence covered with poly sheeting.

“Atlas estimates the amount of CRT hazardous waste to be 660 Gaylord totes located inside the warehouse and another 600 tons of wrapped CRT hazardous waste located outside in the northwest corner of the parking lot,” according to the document. “The total estimated amount of CRT hazardous waste is 1,960 tons or 3.92 million pounds.”

According to the document, Dow/Attan was investigated by the ADEQ between 2014 and 2017, at which time the company was out of business and the responsible parties had fled the country.

Following the assessment, ADEQ requested assistance from the EPA on May 8, 2025. The EPA requested consent to access the property shortly after on May 27, 2025.

The on-scene coordinator for EPA Region 9 was granted funding approval on Aug. 27, 2025. “This funding is necessary to address the release of hazardous substances into the environment, specifically dust containing lead, cadmium, arsenic, barium and chromium,” the coordinator says in a memorandum that requested approval to spend up to $4 million in direct extramural costs to perform a time critical removal action and to request an exemption from the $2 million statutory limit.

The cleanup will be completed in two phases. The first will consist of set up and waste removal and the second will cover cleanup of the rest of the warehouse.

The EPA says that it will begin the first phase by sealing the room housing the material using a layer of large plastic sheets with a vacuum seal, which will trap any debris or dust in the area.

The agency also will install air monitoring and sampling devices inside and outside the sealed work area and will then remove the material in covered boxes from the back entrance of the warehouse and truck to a landfill.

In the second phase, the EPA will wipe down all surfaces in the area, including the ceilings, take the vacuum-sealed plastic sheet out of the removal area and as an extra safety step, workers will wipe the rest of the warehouse’s surfaces and ceiling down, including the Yuma Community Food Bank area.

The memorandum says that the first phase is expected to be completed within three weeks, and the second will be completed within the following five weeks.

But while it may seem as if the industry has given up on decarbonizing U.S. steel production, the reality is much more nuanced.
Based on what’s happened in recent years, I’d be surprised if Nippon Steel plans to source green hydrogen for the project.","I spent much of 2024 writing about the ambitious plans that U.S. steelmakers had to clean up the coal-reliant industry. But by the start of 2025, it was fast becoming clear that those green-steel dreams were in serious trouble.

Under the Biden administration, two big companies had proposed pioneering projects for cleaner steelmaking that were slated to receive $1 billion in federal support and would serve the growing market for lower-carbon metal. The industry seemed poised to begin a new chapter in the storied history of American iron and steel.

The manufacturer SSAB planned to produce iron — the key ingredient in steel — using green hydrogen in Mississippi. Then early last January, I saw the Swedish company had quietly withdrawn from award negotiations with the U.S. Department of Energy following the demise of its would-be hydrogen supplier, Hy Stor Energy. Soon after, President Donald Trump took office for a second time, moving swiftly to rescind grants and dismantle federal programs meant to advance clean energy and curb industrial emissions.

It wasn’t long before Cleveland-Cliffs, the other award recipient, shelved its own initiative for a hydrogen-ready ironmaking plant in Ohio. Today, the company is working with the Trump administration to develop a new scope for the project, one that preserves the use of fossil fuels. And SSAB recently told me that it’s not planning to revive any hydrogen-based projects in the United States.

Green hydrogen, which is made with renewable energy, has long been considered the Holy Grail for decarbonizing heavy industries because it can be used to replace fossil fuels in existing technologies and manufacturing methods. But now the U.S. green hydrogen boom itself has collapsed, taking the steel industry’s ambitions down with it.

At the dawn of 2026, America’s steel producers have no major green hydrogen initiatives slated to start this decade. Supplies of the low-carbon fuel remain scarce and expensive, and there’s no serious, coordinated attempt by the U.S. government to help resolve these stubborn barriers to cleaner steelmaking.

But while it may seem as if the industry has given up on decarbonizing U.S. steel production, the reality is much more nuanced.

Despite the high-profile retreats, manufacturers are still steadily making progress to clean up the country’s nearly 2-century-old industry. Legacy companies are investing in new steel-recycling mills, and startups are building facilities and raising private funding to scale novel technologies. Tech giants are boosting demand for cleaner construction materials as they work to limit the climate impact of the data center boom.

So what should we expect in the year ahead? There is no one clear path forward in the transition to greener steelmaking but rather many winding roads, with some heading toward progress and others looping back to the past. Here are three broad developments I’ll be keeping an eye on.

Coal-fueled furnaces will continue firing up

America’s modern steel era began in the late 19th century, fueled by scorching blast furnaces that use coke — a purified form of coal — to transform iron ore into molten iron, which is then turned into steel. This is still the main way that virgin, or ​“primary,” steel is made today, and it’s responsible for the bulk of the industry’s carbon emissions and toxic air pollution.

In recent decades, U.S. manufacturers have largely shifted to making ​“secondary” steel by recycling scrap metal in electric arc furnaces. But a dozen blast furnaces still operate in a handful of states, and their owners say they’re committed to keeping the facilities running well into the future.

U.S. Steel, which is now a subsidiary of Japan’s Nippon Steel, is set to ​“reline” its largest blast furnace in Gary, Indiana — a major maintenance project that could extend the aging furnace’s operating life by up to 20 years. In late December, U.S. Steel’s board of directors approved $350 million for the undertaking. The company also announced that it will restart operations at an idled blast furnace in southern Illinois to meet rising demand for domestic steel.

Cleveland-Cliffs, which relined one of its blast furnaces in Cleveland in 2022, plans to make similar upgrades at two other mills. The company will reline a blast furnace in Burns Harbor, Indiana, in 2027 and do the same in Middletown, Ohio — the site of its previous hydrogen project — ​“in the next four to five years,” according to CEO Lourenco Goncalves.

“Reality is back. La-la land is gone,” he said about the change of plans during an earnings call last May.

The manufacturers argue that propping up existing infrastructure is the better choice economically for maintaining and expanding their steelmaking capacity, versus building a new furnace or adopting other technologies. In the long run, however, those coal-fueled furnaces could become big liabilities as automakers, data center developers, and other key customers look to suppliers that offer less-carbon-intensive metal.

“The real challenge, from a technology perspective, is that there’s not really a path for a blast furnace to make the [low-carbon] products that are increasingly being demanded in the market,” said Kaitlyn Ramirez, a senior associate in RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries Program. ​“There’s no solution that’s going to be cost-competitive to do that.” She added that the relining decisions represent a ​“window of opportunity” for steel producers to pivot away from coal instead.

Scrap recycling will scale with clean energy

Even as the two steel giants throw a lifeline to a few old dirty furnaces, they and other companies are still making investments to expand lower-carbon production of the ubiquitous, sturdy metal.

Nippon Steel, for its part, recently announced plans to build a $4 billion plant somewhere in the U.S. with two new electric arc furnaces, which typically combine a little bit of iron with a lot of scrap metal. These facilities can curb carbon emissions by 75%, compared to traditional steel mills, because they require using dramatically less coal, a figure that will grow as the nation’s grid increasingly runs on clean energy, according to industry reports.

Its subsidiary U.S. Steel already operates a sprawling steel-recycling operation in Osceola, Arkansas. I visited the Big River Steel site in late 2023, when U.S. Steel was building a second multibillion-dollar plant to make steel specifically for electric vehicle motors, solar panels, and power generators and transformers. Right next door was a field of flattened dirt where Entergy’s 250-megawatt solar farm was soon to be installed.

U.S. Steel finished the construction last year, and the company plans to buy enough clean electricity from the completed solar project to cover 40% of the second plant’s operations. Major steel recyclers like Nucor and Steel Dynamics have also struck deals with clean energy developers in other states to help reduce the emissions associated with running their power-hungry furnaces.

U.S. Steel is also set to construct a ​“direct reduced iron” facility at the Big River Steel site as it works to lead the industry in ​“advanced, sustainable steel production,” spokesperson Amanda Malkowski told the Arkansas news site Talk Business & Politics.

Neither Nippon Steel nor its subsidiary has given many specifics about the new ironmaking project. But most DRI facilities operating today use fossil gas to remove oxygen from iron ore, which yields lumps of iron that are fed into electric arc furnaces. This process emits about half as much CO2 as a coal-fired blast furnace. Using green hydrogen can curb overall emissions even further, by up to 90%, experts say.

Based on what’s happened in recent years, I’d be surprised if Nippon Steel plans to source green hydrogen for the project. But another major steelmaker claims to be committed to using the fuel down the road. Hyundai Motor Group says it plans to build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana by 2029 that will include a DRI facility and an electric arc furnace. The Korean automaker reportedly intends to start producing green hydrogen at the facility in 2034, though it hasn’t said much publicly about how it will manage such a feat.

Global pressure for greener steel will only grow

Industrial giants aren’t the only ones working to clean up U.S. steelmaking. A handful of well-funded startups are steadily advancing newer ways of making the high-strength metal without using coal.

Last year, Boston Metal said it gotten one step closer to commercializing its ​“molten oxide electrolysis” technology after it fired up an industrial-size reactor at its facility in Massachusetts. Electra unveiled the site of its first demonstration plant in Colorado, where the company will produce iron with electrochemical devices powered by renewables. And in Texas, the startup Hertha Metals is turning iron ore directly into steel using a high-temperature, single-step process that currently runs on fossil gas but could switch to green hydrogen whenever supplies become commercially available, Hertha’s CEO Laureen Meroueh told me.

These novel efforts are drawing investment from not just global mining giants and metals manufacturers but also companies that use lots of steel — and see the material as a major source of their own supply chain emissions. Meta, for example, has agreed to buy certificates from Electra that will allow the tech company to count the emissions reductions associated with each ton of Electra’s clean iron toward Meta’s climate targets.

“Many of the long-term-focused large companies are looking at sustainability goals that last 10 to 20 years,” said Greg Matlock, the Americas metals and mining tax leader at accounting firm Ernst & Young. ​“Regardless of what the current political landscape is, I do think there’s absolutely still an appetite [for industrial decarbonization], and it’s a global appetite.”

The European Union is driving much of that global momentum. On Jan. 1, the 27-member bloc began implementing a carbon border tariff, which charges fees on imports of steel, aluminum, and other industrial products made in dirtier facilities abroad. The idea is to level the playing field for European manufacturers that invest in cleaner and potentially costlier facilities, while also encouraging other countries to regulate their own industrial CO2 emissions.

The carbon tariff won’t directly affect U.S. steelmakers all that much, given that they export only a tiny amount of metal to EU-member countries. But the policy’s ripple effects are already transforming the broader industry and putting pressure on all steel producers to modernize and clean up. Countries such as Brazil and Turkey have introduced domestic carbon-pricing policies in response to the EU’s moves. China has started shipping steel made using hydrogen to Italy, which experts say could set the stage for boosting Chinese green-steel exports.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Electric-Arc-Furnace.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=691f0182a1464f15d02156c0f8849fd7,N,,2026-01-12 19:59:27.603089

(January 12, 2026)—The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued final nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standards for new stationary gas turbines, including new gas-fired power plants. These standards, which have not been updated since 2006, have taken on increased importance with the surge of new gas-fired power plant proposals cropping up around the country to meet speculated new data center electricity demand; however, the final rule is significantly weaker than the 2024 proposal and includes new polluter loopholes.

“Communities across the country are scrambling to fight the threat of surging pollution harms from new fossil gas plants built to meet insatiable data center electricity demand.

Innovation Fund 25 Heat Auction

The European Commission is preparing the first pan-European industrial process heat auction – the IF25 Heat Auction. The call opened on 4 December 2025, with a total budget of EUR 1 billion.

Scope and objective

The auction supports projects that electrify industrial process heat (e.g. heat pumps/MVR, electric boilers, resistive heating, induction, plasma and shockwave heating) as well as projects using direct renewable heat (solar thermal and geothermal) in industrial processes. The objective is to achieve cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to accelerate the market uptake of industrial process heat decarbonisation technologies.

The auction covers two thematic areas (temperature baskets):

Low-temperature basket: 100–400°C, indicative budget of EUR 500 million.

High-temperature basket: >400°C, indicative budget of EUR 500 million.

Unused funds may be reallocated between the baskets.

Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) must be carried out within an energy management system compliant with ISO 50001 or EMAS, including the measurement of temperature and heat flow.

Support structure

Support will be granted in the form of a fixed premium per tonne of CO₂ avoided through the production of eligible industrial process heat (EUR/tCO₂). The premium will be paid on a semi-annual basis for a maximum period of five years from the date the installation enters the Entry into Operation phase, in proportion to the verified output.

Projects meeting the eligibility requirements will be ranked solely on the basis of the bid price per tonne of CO₂ avoided.

The application must declare the thermal capacity and the annual volume of avoided CO₂ emissions, aggregated over the entire five-year support period.

The maximum grant amount is up to EUR 100 million for projects in the 100–400°C basket and up to EUR 250 million for high-temperature projects (>400°C).

Key project requirements:

Project location: The installation must be located within the EEA and implemented at a single physical site (no “virtual” aggregation of capacity from different locations).

Scale and process parameters: The project must achieve at least 3 MWth of eligible process heat capacity and operate at a temperature of ≥100°C, in line with the relevant temperature basket.

Eligible scope: Support is limited strictly to industrial process heat. Space heating, heat sales to district heating networks, and electric arc furnaces are excluded. Processes that are already largely electrified may also be excluded from eligibility..

New production capacity: Only new low-emission heat capacity is eligible for support. Projects involving the construction of new fossil-fuel-based capacity are, as a rule, not eligible, except in cases explicitly permitted under the call documentation. The use of heat pumps recovering waste heat from existing fossil-fuel-based installations may be allowed.

Strategic importance of the programme

The IF25 Heat Auction supports the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal and serves as a pilot for the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank, enhancing cost transparency and directing funding towards verified and measurable climate outcomes.

Through the Auctions-as-a-Service (AaaS) model, EEA countries may co-finance projects using national funds based on a common procedure; data on winning bids will be made public.

Indicative timeline:

Call opening: 4 December 2025

Call closure: 19 February 2026.

Announcement of results (projects invited to sign grant agreements): May–June 2026

Signature of grant agreements: by November 2026

The submission comes as Tesla appears to be accelerating the expansion of its insurance program after a three-year drought.

The filing was made by Tesla Property & Casualty and outlines a full private-passenger auto program designed specifically for Tesla vehicles, with a proposed starting date of March 1, 2026. (via Coverager)

If that timeline holds, Indiana won’t be the only state to see Tesla Insurance arrive in March. As we told you earlier today, Tesla recently submitted a similar filing to also expand their insurance program to Tennessee. Under the program in both states, Tesla will track how much of a driver’s monthly mileage is completed with FSD (Supervised) enabled, and an insurance discount will be canulated monthly and applied to the policy.

That discount is layered on top of Tesla’s broader telematics-based pricing model, using the company’s Safety Score system, which has become the foundation of its insurance business. The score evaluates real-world driving behaviour, including hard braking, aggressive turning, speeding, following distance, and mileage. These factors are recalculated every 30 days, allowing premiums to rise or fall based on how a customer actually drives.

In California, Tesla Insurance is not allowed to use real-time telematics or driving behaviour to set premiums, as state regulations prohibit insurers from basing rates on live vehicle data.

The Indiana and Tennessee filings come just days after Tesla broke a three-year expansion drought by launching Tesla Insurance in Florida, its first new state since 2022. Florida became Tesla’s 13th insurance market and one of its most important, given the state’s high premiums and shrinking pool of traditional insurers.

(TNS)

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday doubled down on California’s commitment to electric vehicles with proposed rebates intended to backfill federal tax credits canceled by the Trump administration.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles. It was part of a sweeping $348.9-billion state budget proposal released Friday, which also included items to address air pollution and worsening wildfires, amid a projected $3-billion state deficit.

EVs have become a flashpoint in California’s battle against the Trump administration, which moved last year to repeal the state’s long-held authority to set strict tailpipe emission standards and eventually ban the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California’s Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. “This incentive program will help continue the state’s ZEV momentum, especially with the federal administration eliminating the federal EV tax credit and carpool lane access.”

Newsom had previously flip-flopped on this idea, first vowing to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars and then walking it back in September. That same month, a group of five automakers including Honda, Rivian, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Audi wrote a letter urging Newsom and state legislators to establish a $5,000 EV tax rebate to replace the lost federal incentives, Politico reported.

During his State of the State speech Thursday—one year after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles—Newsom said California “refuse[s] to be bystanders” while China and other nations take the lead on electric vehicles and the clean energy transition. He touted the state’s investments in solar, hydrogen, wind and nuclear power, as well as its recent move away from the use of any coal-fired power.

“We must continue our prudent fiscal management, funding our reserves, and continuing the investments Californians rely on, from education to public safety, all while preparing for Trump’s volatility outside our control,” the governor said in a statement. “This is what responsible governance looks like.”

Several environmental groups had been urging Newsom to invest more in clean air and clean vehicle programs, which they say are critical to the state’s ambitious goals for human health and the environment. Transportation is the largest source of climate and air pollution in California and is responsible for more than a third of global warming emissions, said Daniel Barad, Western states policy manager with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

“As federal attacks threaten California’s authority to protect public health, incentives are more essential than ever to scale up clean cars and trucks,” Barad said. “The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California senior director with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, called it “an essential step to save money for Californians, cut harmful pollution, spur innovation, and support the global competitiveness of our auto industry.”

While the budget proposal does not include significant new spending proposals, it contains other line items relating to climate and the environment. Among them are plans to continue implementing Proposition 4, the $10 billion climate bond approved by voters in 2024 for programs geared toward wildfire resilience, safe drinking water, flood management, extreme heat mitigation and other similar efforts.

Among $2.1 billion in climate bond investments proposed this year are $58 million for wildfire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects in vulnerable communities, and nearly $20 million to assist homeowners with defensible space to prevent fire. Water-related investments include $232 million for flood control projects and nearly $70 million to support repairs to existing or new water conveyance projects.

The proposal also lays out how to spend money from California’s signature cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions. State lawmakers last year voted to extend the program through 2045 and rename it cap-and-invest.

The spending plan includes a new tiered structure for cap-and-invest that first funds statutory obligations such as manufacturing tax exemptions, followed by $1 billion for the high-speed rail project, $750 million to support the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and finally secondary program funding such as affordable housing and low-carbon transit options.

But while some groups applauded the budget’s broad handling of climate issues, others criticized it for leaning too heavily on volatile funding sources for environmental priorities, such as special funds and one-time allocations.

The Sierra Club called the EV incentive program a crucial investment but said too many other items were left with “patchwork strategies that make long-term planning harder.”

“Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk. That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,” said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.

California Environmental Voters, meanwhile, stressed that the state should continue to work toward legislation that would hold oil and gas companies liable for damages caused by their emissions—a plan known as “Make Polluters Pay” that stalled last year amid fierce lobbying and industry pressure.

“Instead of asking families to absorb the costs, the Legislature must look seriously at holding polluters accountable for the harm they’ve caused,” said Shannon Olivieri Hovis, California Environmental Voters’ chief strategy officer.

Sarah Swig, Newsom’s senior advisor for climate, noted that the state’s budget plan came just days after Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major global treaty signed by nearly 200 countries with the aim of addressing global warming through coordinated international action.

“California is not slowing down on climate at a time when we continue to see attack after attack from the federal government, including as recently as this week with the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the UNFCCC,” Swig told reporters Friday. “California’s leadership has never mattered more.”

ICE

Washington, D.C. — Twelve Members of Congress have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The Members filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order affirmed all Members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

The lawsuit, Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Rep. Norma Torres, Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; and Rep. Raul Ruiz.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

LENEXA, KAN. (JAN. 12, 2025) – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proud to announce significant progress remediating lead-contaminated properties throughout EPA Region 7, marking more environmental cleanup milestones in the nation’s heartland. During 2025, EPA Region 7 cleaned up over 775 residential properties and removed 1,098,965 cubic yards of waste.

“The work EPA Region 7 staff completed this year cleaning up lead from historic mining operations was no small feat,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy. “By hitting our 2025 targets, EPA is delivering on our promise to protect communities from exposure to lead and we look forward to continuing to work with our state and local partners in 2026 to ensure that our cleanup operations throughout the heartland are efficient, effective, and protective.”

Removing lead across our nation is key to fulfilling EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment and is especially important for reducing exposure for children. Across EPA’s Region 7 states, the agency has overseen the cleanup of over 29,000 residential properties and the removal and disposal of over 45 million cubic yards of waste since cleanups started at the following sites:

Old Lead Belt and the Viburnum Trend

In 2025, EPA led, or oversaw potentially responsible parties, cleanup of 439 residential properties and the removal of 139,039 cubic yards of waste in Missouri’s historic Old Lead Belt and the Viburnum Trend.

Tri-State Mining District

In 2025, EPA led the cleanup of 97 residential properties and the removal of 927,393 cubic yards of waste in the Kansas and Missouri sections of the historic Tri-State Mining District. This number does not include cleanup efforts going on at the Tar Creek Superfund Site, since the site is being remediated by the Quapaw Nation and the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

Former Smelter Sites

In 2025, EPA led the cleanup of 239 residential properties and the removal of 32,533 cubic yards of waste at former smelter sites across Region 7.

The former smelter sites include Caney Residential Yards, Cherokee Zinc – Weir Smelter, and Former United Zinc and Associated Smelters in Kansas; and Omaha Lead in Nebraska.

In 2025, EPA Region 7 awarded $3.3 million in cooperative agreements to six county health departments throughout the Old Lead Belt, the Tri-State Mining District, and to the Douglas County Health Department in Nebraska. Cooperative agreements with county health departments help fund continued lead health education and outreach for EPA’s local partners to raise awareness about elevated blood lead levels and the steps families can take to reduce potential exposure to lead.

EPA Region 7 will continue its work remediating residential yards impacted by lead mining and removing mine waste from local communities throughout the heartland. The agency is committed to fulfilling its core mission of protecting human health and the environment and looks forward to building on this throughout 2026.

The court concluded that the Act likely violates the First Amendment because it imposes content-based restrictions on speech by conditioning access to app store content on age verification and parental consent and fails to satisfy the strict scrutiny standard that applies to such restrictions. In particular, the court found, inter alia, that the Act’s sweeping application to all apps, regardless of content, was not narrowly tailored to the state’s interest in mitigating the alleged mental and physical health effects of mobile app usage.

The Texas attorney general filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit the same day the injunction was issued. While the Act remains enjoined and companies are not currently required to implement its age-verification and parental-consent regime, app stores and app developers should continue to consider potential compliance obligations, as the law could be reinstated on appeal.

Please see our previous alert regarding the Texas law below.

A new Texas law is poised to significantly reshape how app stores and developers manage users under 18. The state’s App Store Accountability Act (the “Act”) becomes effective on January 1, 2026. The Act will require app stores serving Texans to verify users’ ages and secure parental consent for minors’ downloads and purchases, and will impose related obligations on developers whose applications are offered through those stores, among other requirements.

Along with similar legislation in Utah and Louisiana, the Act signals a shift toward mobile app stores sharing responsibility with developers for minors’ online safety.

Below is a summary of the Act’s key provisions and the implications for businesses within its sweeping scope.

Scope

The Act imposes obligations on both app store owners and app developers that make applications available to Texas users.

App Stores include any publicly available Internet website, software application, or other electronic service that distributes software applications from the owner or developer of a software application to the user of a mobile device. There are no size or revenue thresholds, so even niche or non-traditional platforms may fall within the scope of the law.

App Developers are developers of software applications that are made available to users through an app store.

Key Requirements for App Stores

Age Verification and Categorization: When a Texas user creates an account, app stores must use a commercially reasonable method to determine the user’s age category, classifying them as a child (under 13), younger teenager (13–15), older teenager (16–17), or adult (18 or older). The Act, however, does not clarify what qualifies as a “commercially reasonable” method.

Transparency of Age Rating: App stores must display age ratings for every app. If the app store has not developed its own age-rating system, the store must display a developer-provided rating along with the content or features of the application that informed the rating. In all cases, the information must be clear, accurate, and conspicuous.

Parental Account Affiliation: For users under 18, the app store must link minors’ accounts to a parent or guardian account and use a commercially reasonable method to verify that the adult has legal authority over the minor.

Parental Consent:

Blanket approvals are not allowed; app stores must obtain a parent’s or guardian’s consent for each download or in-app purchase by a minor. Certain apps, such as those providing emergency services, are exempt.

In order to obtain consent, app stores must clearly disclose to parents or guardians: (i) the app or purchase at issue along with the app’s age rating, (ii) the elements that led to the age rating, (iii) personal data collected or used in connection with the app or purchase, and (iv) any measures the app developer has implemented to safeguard personal data.

If a developer makes material changes to its app, such as conducting new personal data processing activities, adding monetization functionality, adjusting age ratings, or making significant functional updates, the app store must secure updated consent from minors’ parents or guardians.

Transparency to Developers: App stores must allow developers to access, using a commercially available method, the age category assigned to each user and whether consent has been obtained. Additionally, app stores must notify developers if parents or guardians revoke consent. Notably, the Act contains a safe harbor for developers who rely in good faith on information received from the app store and have otherwise complied with the requirements of the Act.

Use of Personal Data: App stores must collect only the personal data necessary for age verification, parental consent, and records of compliance, and must transmit that data using industry-standard encryption.

Key Requirements for App Developers

App Rating Designation: Developers must assign age ratings for each app and purchase and clearly disclose the content or elements of the app or purchase that informed that rating.

Notice of Significant Changes: If a developer makes significant changes to the app, such as changing how or what personal data is collected or used, changing the rating assigned to the software application or the content or element that led to the rating, adding monetization features, or materially altering the functionality or user experience, they must notify the app store in order to allow the app store to notify minors’ parents and guardians and renew consent.

Developer Age Verification: Developers must implement a system to use information from the app store to verify the age category assigned to each user and confirm whether consent has been obtained for minors to download or make purchases within the app.

Use of Personal Data: App developers may only use personal data provided by the app stores pursuant to the Act to enforce age restrictions, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and implement safety features and default settings. Developers must delete such information once verification is complete.

Enforcement

Violations of the Act constitute deceptive trade practices under Texas’s Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which permits the Texas attorney general to seek injunctive relief and impose civil penalties, and also allows for consumer remedies.

Key Impacts

Broad and Ambiguous Application: Because the Act does not have any size or revenue thresholds for applicability, the Act’s broad definition of “app store” could capture platforms that do not consider themselves traditional app stores, including niche software distributors or download facilitators. These businesses may face operational difficulties in linking minor accounts to parents or guardians, communicating age and consent information to developers, and implementing age verification across their platforms.

Actual Knowledge of Minor Users: By requiring app stores to provide developers with information that their apps are being used by minors, the Act creates “actual knowledge” of minor usage. For apps intended for a general audience, this could trigger obligations under COPPA if personal information is collected from children under 13, or under teen privacy laws in other states that are triggered by having actual knowledge of users under 18.

Tension with Data Minimization Principles: The Act obligates app stores to collect and disclose, and developers to receive and confirm, personal data for age verification and parental consent requirements, information app stores and developers may not have otherwise collected. While the Act imposes a general data minimization guardrail, this mandate could still significantly expand data-processing activities, especially for functional apps such as weather or utility services, and may create friction with other state privacy laws that prioritize strict data minimization and short retention periods.

Outlook

Minor privacy and online safety laws nationwide are facing mounting constitutional challenges, including around age-verification provisions, and the Act has not been immune to these challenges. In October 2025, two lawsuits were filed challenging the Act. The first, brought by the advocacy group Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT), argues that the Act’s sweeping age-verification and parental-consent requirements for all app downloads and in-app purchases unlawfully impose a content-based prior restraint on speech, in violation of the First Amendment. The complaint contends that the law substitutes the state’s judgment for that of parents, undermining their ability to decide how much privacy and autonomy to grant their children online. Similarly, the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) asserts that protecting younger internet users should not come at the expense of free expression and personal privacy, as the Act restricts access to lawful content and places onerous verification and consent burdens on both parents and minors. However, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld Texas’s pornography age-verification law, which may indicate that Texas’s broader framework for regulating minors’ digital access could be better positioned to survive early challenges.

In light of this, app stores—and any business offering a mobile application—should begin preparing now to operationalize the Act’s technical requirements. At the same time, companies should carefully assess their privacy compliance strategies (particularly with respect to minors’ data) to minimize exposure, especially given the increased attention given to children’s online safety nationwide.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.78_1208.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:28.942610

The budget also makes higher education more affordable, expands the full-day four-year-old kindergarten program, provides breakfast at no cost to every student, and recommends a comprehensive population growth study to ensure South Carolina's infrastructure and essential services can keep pace with the state's rapid growth.

""Our state government is in superior fiscal shape, its laws and policies are business friendly. The state’s income tax is shrinking every year, while our population continues to grow. Investments in education, public safety and workforce training are paying off. We are preserving and protecting our lands, natural resources, and cultural heritage for future generations. And our infrastructure and energy demands are being met with planning, foresight, and commitment,"" Governor McMaster wrote in a letter to the General Assembly. ""South Carolina’s future prosperity requires that we constantly work to create, innovate and improve our efforts in each of these endeavors. By thinking big, by being bold, and by making these transformative investments, I believe we will set our state on a course that will provide the opportunity for prosperity, success, and happiness for generations of South Carolinians.""

A copy of the governor's executive budget, along with his letter to the General Assembly and a detailed explanation of each allocation, can be found here, and a copy of a presentation outlining the governor's priorities can be found here.

The following executive budget highlights are attributable to Governor McMaster:

Executive Budget Highlights:

Over $1 Billion in New Money to Keep Road Projects Moving:

""We have made tremendous progress improving our roadways, with major projects under construction in every corner of the state. Currently there are almost $7 billion in active projects underway across the state, up from $2.7 billion in 2017. Much of that progress is a result of four years’ worth of state budget appropriations totaling $1.4 billion for new construction and improvements to state-owned roads, bridges, highways, and interstates.

""However, nationally and here in South Carolina, inflationary construction and labor cost increases now threaten to create crippling delays and busted budgets for major road construction projects currently underway and those soon to break ground.

""My Executive Budget recommends an appropriation of $1.1 billion in new surplus money to keep current and future construction projects moving and on schedule despite inflationary cost increases.""

Population Growth Study for the Future:

""In addition to inflation, South Carolina’s major infrastructure systems and essential government services are struggling to support and keep up with the explosive and unrestrained population growth happening across the state. Last year, the U-Haul rental company ranked South Carolina as the number one destination for their moving trucks and vans.

""Left unaddressed, the state may face future problems with water and sewer access, traffic congestion, road and bridge repair, demand for electric power generation, public safety, school overcrowding, and healthcare availability.

""The time has come, and we must start now, to conduct a thorough analysis and study to determine if our state’s infrastructure and government services will be able to keep pace if population growth continues unrestrained.

""This Executive Budget includes a proviso directing the Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs to issue a request for information (RFI) to identify the scope, expectations, and costs for developing one or more comprehensive analyses to measure the impacts of the 10 and 20-year projected population growth on South Carolina’s infrastructure and essential government services.""

Largest Rainy Day Savings Fund:

""South Carolina government currently maintains its largest rainy day reserve fund balance and low amounts of general obligation debt. In 2022-2023 my Executive Budget began recommending that we maintain a “rainy-day” fund balance of no less than 10% of the total General Fund revenues each year.

""To maintain that balance, I am recommending that a total of $1.4 billion be set aside and placed in the State’s “rainy day” fund. Saving money instead of spending it has served our state well – and ensures that we will always be prepared for future economic uncertainties.""

Keep Cutting the Income Tax:

""Until a few years ago, South Carolina had the highest personal income tax rate in the Southeast and the 12th highest in the nation. No more.

""Five years ago, I signed into law the largest income tax cut in state history. As a result, South Carolina taxpayers have kept an additional $1.275 billion of their hard-earned money. My Executive Budget continues to cut the state’s income tax an additional $107.2 million, by dropping the rate from 6% to 5.9%.

""And we don’t need to stop at 5.9% – we should continue cutting or eliminating the personal income tax rate as much as we can, and as fast as we can.""

New Teacher Pay - $50,500.00:

""Eight years ago, the minimum starting salary of a teacher in South Carolina was $30,113 and the average teacher salary was below the Southeastern average. At that time, I proposed that we begin raising the minimum starting teacher salary, as much as possible each year, with the goal of raising it to at least $50,000 by 2026.

""This year, my Executive Budget recommends spending $150 million of the budget surplus to continue raising the minimum starting teacher salary, going from $48,500 to $50,500. This represents a 68% increase since 2017. South Carolina’s required minimum starting teacher salary continues to exceed that of both Georgia and North Carolina.

""In addition, as the minimum salary for new teachers has risen, so has the average salary of a public school teacher in South Carolina, reaching $64,050 last year, which has exceeded the Southeastern average every year since 2021.""

Expanding Full-Day 4K:

""Since the statewide expansion of the full-day four-year-old kindergarten program (4K) starting in the 2021-2022 school year, enrollment in the program offered in public schools, private childcare centers, and private schools, has increased significantly.

""Today, 18,411 students are enrolled in the program, which is a 30% increase since the program was expanded. Currently, every public school district in the state, except one, is offering full-day four-year-old kindergarten for children from low-income households with an annual income that is at or below 150% of federal poverty guidelines.

""Enrollment has also grown at the private day cares, private schools and community head start providers participating in the program. According to the Office of First Steps to School Readiness (First Steps) there are currently 1,899 classroom slots available at these private providers.

""To fill these available classroom slots, this Executive Budget includes an appropriation of $9.9 million to the Office of First Steps to expand enrollment eligibility to children from households with an annual income that is at or below 300% of the federal poverty guidelines. As an example, a family of four with a household income of $96,450 would be eligible.""

Breakfast For Every Public School Student:

""Recently, the State of Arkansas began offering free breakfast to all public school students – regardless of household income. I propose that South Carolina do the same.

""Research studies have documented that children who eat breakfast daily are better prepared to learn in the classroom. Eating breakfast improves their cognitive performance, attention, memory, and behavior – thereby improving their academic performance.

""My Executive Budget recommends an appropriation of $8.7 million in new money, which the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA) estimates will fund 4.1 million meals, sufficient to provide a daily breakfast for every public school student in the state.""

Expanding School Choice:

""The Education Scholarship Trust Fund provides scholarships to eligible low-income parents so they can choose the type of education environment and instruction that best suits their child’s unique needs. Last year, the General Assembly increased the minimum number of scholarships required to be funded in this year’s state budget from 10,000 to 15,000. They placed no cap on the number of scholarships that may be funded above 15,000.

""Due to the popularity of the program, my Executive Budget recommends expanding the number of funded scholarships to 20,000 with an appropriation of $61.4 million in new money, which will also increase the scholarship award amount from $7,500 to $7,634.""

School Resource Officers in Every School:

""Placing an armed, certified school resource officer (SRO) in every school, in every county, all day, every day, has been one of my top priorities as governor. At my request, the General Assembly began funding a grant program administered by the Department of Public Safety, to provide school districts with funds to hire more resource officers for our state’s 1,283 public schools.

""The grant program has been very successful and has more than tripled the number of schools with an officer assigned to a school, going from 406 in 2018 to 1,181 in 2025.

""In last year’s budget, and at my request, the General Assembly provided the final full-funding necessary to place a full-time SRO in all 1,283 public schools statewide. While it is no longer necessary to request an appropriation of new money for the program, this Executive Budget maintains the current level of annual funding at $56.2 million.""

Freezing College Tuition:

""This year marks the seventh consecutive year that I will propose that we freeze college tuition for in-state students with an appropriation of $39.2 million. To receive funds from this appropriation, each institution is required to certify that there will be no in-state tuition or mandatory fee increase for the 2026-2027 academic year.""

College Maintenance and New Capital Projects:

""My Executive Budget recommends appropriating $81.7 million in one-time funds for deferred maintenance and critical capital building projects on the campuses of our public colleges and universities, and $40.3 million for the state’s technical college campuses.

""The formula used to calculate each school's appropriation is based on each school’s fall 2025 in-state enrollment reported to the Commission on Higher Education (CHE). Each college and university receives $1,000 for each in-state undergraduate student enrolled in the fall of 2025; the technical colleges $500.""

Increasing Need-Based Financial Aid:

""For the sixth year in a row, my Executive Budget proposes providing $80 million in state lottery funds for needs-based grants so that every South Carolinian who qualifies for financial aid – as measured by federal Pell Grants – has sufficient state financial assistance to attend any in-state public college, university, or technical college. Students at private, independent, and historically black colleges and universities will receive an additional $20 million for Tuition Grants and assistance as well.

""I am also recommending funding for a new needs-based college scholarship, the Meeting Street Scholarships, using $15 million in new one-time funds. These funds will help leverage private donations to provide a $10,000 annual college scholarship up-to four years, for academically prepared, Pell Grant eligible, in-state students to attend an eligible South Carolina college or university.""

Future of Higher Education Institutions Study:

""Once again, I will renew my call for the General Assembly to fund and authorize a systemic review of our state’s 33 public institutions of higher education, to be procured by the Department of Employment and Workforce. The goal is to make sure we are preparing to meet our state’s future workforce needs.

""This study will address the sustainability, accessibility, and affordability, as well as provide an assessment of the need for consolidation of existing physical space, programs, certificates, and degrees offered at our public colleges and universities, as compared to the projected workforce needs of our state in the future.""

Workforce Technical College Scholarships:

""To address the high demand for skills, training, and knowledge, this Executive Budget once again provides $95 million in lottery funds to South Carolina Workforce Industry Needs Scholarships (SC WINS) through the South Carolina Technical College System.

""This very successful program has provided over 120,000 South Carolinians with scholarships to cover the cost of tuition and required fees at any of our technical colleges to earn a post-secondary or industry credential in high-demand careers like manufacturing, nursing, computer science, information technology, transportation, logistics, or construction.""

MUSC Comprehensive Cancer Hospital:

""The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) estimates that South Carolina’s incidence of cancer rate for adults ages 18 and over will be 18% between 2023 and 2028, surpassing the national growth rate of 12%. And, over the next 15 years, cancer rates are projected to increase by 30%.

""This Executive Budget recommends $115 million for the creation of a new National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated Comprehensive Cancer Hospital at MUSC. With this important designation, MUSC will be able to deliver best-in-class cancer care and cutting-edge clinical trials for all South Carolinians, including those in rural and underserved communities.""

New Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities:

""In the last two years, we completed the most significant government restructuring and accountability effort in over thirty years – bringing direct gubernatorial accountability to the actions of our largest state healthcare service delivery agencies.

""The first step of our restructuring effort came two years ago, when the commission run Department of Health and Environmental Control was dissolved and was statutorily reconstituted as two new gubernatorial cabinet agencies – the Department of Public Health and the Department of Environmental Services.

""Then a year later, the commission run Department of Mental Health, and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs were dissolved and reconstituted, along with the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services, into a new gubernatorial cabinet agency, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities.

""My Executive Budget recommends that almost $100 million be appropriated to these new cabinet agencies as they work to improve and modernize access to healthcare delivery services for the South Carolinians who depend on them.""

Land Preservation and Conservation:

""Once again, my Executive Budget recommends that significant funds – $68 million – be appropriated to the Conservation Land Bank, the Department of Natural Resources, the Office of Resilience, and the Forestry Commission for the purposes of identifying and preserving culturally or environmentally significant or endangered properties, and also for flooding mitigation efforts.

""In addition, I am recommending the Conservation Land Bank receive $3 million for the purpose of awarding voluntary conservation easements to preserve working agricultural farms and forested land for future generations of farmers. To date, 1,650 acres have been preserved using these easements.""

Law Enforcement Pay Raises and New Officers:

""A few years ago, we tasked the South Carolina Department of Administration with conducting a comprehensive analysis of law enforcement pay within state government. This effort was aimed at ensuring salaries are competitive to attract and retain top-tier talent.

""As a result, and each year since, South Carolina's law enforcement officers have received substantial pay raises – some as high as 52% in the last three years. My Executive Budget continues our investment in our state law enforcement professionals by providing an additional $10.7 million for pay raises and for the hiring of new agents and officers.""

First Responder Income Tax Credit:

""I renew my call for the General Assembly to provide a $2,000 state income tax credit for every active-duty law enforcement officer, firefighter, first responder, and emergency medical technician employed by a public entity. This nonrefundable tax credit will provide a total of $45 million in income tax relief for those who put their lives on the line each day to protect and serve the public.""

Law Enforcement Grants for Sheriffs:

""This Executive Budget also creates a $35 million equipment grant program for our state’s 46 sheriffs, administered by the Department of Public Safety. To be eligible, the sheriff or a member of their command staff must have completed, be enrolled in, or attest to future enrollment in, the Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program at the University of South Carolina Law School.""

Department of Corrections:

""In addition, I recommend the Department of Corrections be appropriated $58.89 million for pay raises, new staff hires, deferred maintenance, inflationary operating costs, and technology upgrades at our state’s 21 prisons""

State Disaster Relief Program:

""Last year, in the wake of Hurricane Helene, I proposed that the General Assembly create and fund the South Carolina Public Assistance (PA) program to be administered by the South Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD). This grant program allows local governments, public utilities, nonprofit, and charitable aid organizations to apply for disaster recovery funds – funds that were either denied by the federal government or did not meet federal FEMA thresholds. This year, I am recommending the program receive an appropriation of $20 million in one-time funds.""",https://governor.sc.gov/themes/custom/governorpalmetto/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:37.670110

Analysts predict that the global market for 21700 lithium-ion batteries will continue to grow at a rapid pace, with compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) in the double digits over the next decade. The growth of this market is attributed to the vital role these batteries play in Energy Storage Systems (ESS), mobile medical devices, sophisticated tracking and security systems, and portable electronics. The industry’s growth trajectory is driven by continuous innovation, with a focus on enhanced safety features, faster charging capabilities, and tighter regulatory compliance. In this technologically demanding environment, the criteria for selecting a battery manufacturer have narrowed to focus on established production expertise and proven quality in 21700 lithium battery manufacturing.

Modern industrial landscapes are being fundamentally transformed by the need for portable, powerful, and sustainable energy storage. As electric vehicles (EVs), high-performance tools, and consumer electronics become more prevalent, the demand for batteries that offer high energy density alongside safety and reliability continues to surge. The 21700 cell is essential to the global push toward decarbonization and electrification.

21700: The Next Generation of Cylindrical Battery Technology

The 21700 cell (21mm diameter, 70.0mm length) is widely regarded as the “golden size” of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Originally pioneered by Tesla and Panasonic to break the energy density limitations of the legacy 18650 format, it has since become the benchmark for high-performance applications.

While the physical dimensions increase only slightly, the volume of a 21700 cell is approximately 47% greater than that of an 18650. This increase allows for a disproportionate boost in performance:

Capacity: While high-end 18650s max out around 3.5Ah, 21700 cells commonly offer 4.0Ah to 5.0Ah, with next-generation prototypes pushing toward 6.0Ah.

Energy Density: On a system level, 21700 packs typically offer a 20% increase in energy density. This means fewer cells are required to achieve the same range or runtime, reducing the overall footprint of the battery pack.

The transition to 21700 wasn’t just about making the “can” bigger; it involved a complete overhaul of internal chemistry and mechanical design:

Tabless & Multi-Tab Design: Many high-drain 21700 cells (like the Samsung 40T or 50S) utilize advanced tab designs to minimize Internal Resistance (IR). Lower resistance means less heat generation and the ability to sustain higher continuous discharge currents (often up to 35A-45A).

Silicon-Carbon Anodes: To maximize capacity, manufacturers are increasingly replacing traditional graphite anodes with Silicon-Carbon (Si-C) composites, which have a much higher theoretical energy storage capacity.

High-Nickel Cathodes: Most 21700 cells utilize NCM 811 (Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) or NCA (Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum) chemistries. The high nickel content increases energy but requires the superior thermal management that the 21700’s larger surface area provides.

The cylindrical lithium-ion market has undergone significant changes, and the 21700 battery is now the standard for high-drain applications.

Eight states cut income tax rates on Jan. 1, 2026. Nebraska’s top rate drops to 4.55 %. Indiana falls to 2.95 %, Ohio simplifies to 2.75 %. North Carolina reaches 3.99 %, Kentucky 3.5 %, and Montana 5.65 %. Oklahoma and Mississippi also lower rates. Residents keep more earnings. States aim to boost growth, attract workers, and investments.

New state income tax cuts took effect on Jan. 1, 2026, as eight U.S. states lowered their individual income tax rates to give working families and businesses more take‑home pay. These reductions, enacted by state legislatures and governors over the last several years, reflect ongoing efforts to make local economies more competitive and attract residents, talent and investment. The cuts come amid broader national tax debates, including federal policy changes and rising state budget pressures.

Across the eight states, top marginal and flat tax rates fell by meaningful margins, offering residents immediate financial relief as they begin the new tax year. Tax policy experts say these changes could boost consumer spending and economic growth, while critics caution that revenue losses may strain public services if long‑term budget planning is weak. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank tracking state tax policy changes, reports all eight cuts went into effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

These state tax cuts are part of a broader pattern of tax reform across the U.S., which also includes discussions at the federal level about potential changes to deductions and tax brackets scheduled to shift in coming years. As Americans adjust to new tax rules in 2026, many may see a tangible increase in their paychecks or tax refunds. Recent financial analysis also shows some households could see larger refunds due to changes in federal SALT (state and local tax) deduction rules.

States with lower income tax rates in 2026

The following states reduced their individual income tax rates effective Jan. 1, 2026. These cuts vary by tax structure, from flat rates to top marginal brackets:

Indiana: The state’s flat tax rate dropped from 3.00 % in 2025 to 2.95 % in 2026. Indiana lawmakers also approved future reductions, including lowering the rate further to 2.90 % on Jan. 1, 2027, and a potential goal of 2.55 % in even‑numbered years starting in 2030 if revenue targets are met.

Kentucky: The flat rate fell to 3.5 % from 4.0 %, representing the largest percentage drop among these states.

Mississippi: Continued its scheduled multi‑year phase‑down, reducing its flat rate to 4.0 % from 4.4 %.

Montana: Its top marginal rate decreased to 5.65 % from 5.9 %, while its lower bracket remains 4.7 % but now applies over a wider income range.

Nebraska: The top rate dropped to 4.55 % from 5.2 % as part of a planned phase‑down that aims to reach around 3.99 % by 2027.

North Carolina: Continued down its long‑term tax plan with the flat rate now at 3.99 %, from 4.25 %, marking the final scheduled cut in this multi‑year process.

Ohio: Adopted a flat tax of 2.75 % on income above $26,050, with no tax on income below that threshold — dramatically simplifying the rate structure.

Oklahoma: Reduced its top rate to 4.5 % from 4.75 % and consolidated six tax brackets into three broader brackets.

These rate changes mean residents in those states can expect to pay less in income taxes for the 2026 tax year. For example, a Nebraska resident who previously paid the 5.2 % top rate will now have more disposable income each pay period or when filing in 2027. Similarly, Ohio’s flat tax simplification could benefit middle‑income earners who previously faced a more complex rate schedule.

Live Events

Tax Foundation data show that these changes reflect a broader shift toward lower rates and less progressive tax structures. Flat tax systems — which many of these states embrace — aim to provide simplicity and certainty for taxpayers. However, some tax analysts raise potential concerns about budget shortfalls if states don’t appropriately plan for reduced revenue streams.

Why states are cutting income taxes

State leaders argue that income tax cuts can boost economic growth, attract workers, and support small businesses. Lower rates may encourage consumer spending, increase job creation, and make states more attractive for relocation. In an era when many companies are choosing where to expand or relocate, tax competitiveness has become a factor in economic development strategies.

Proponents say that when residents keep more of their earnings, they are more likely to spend locally, invest, or save — injecting more activity into state economies. For employers, lower personal tax rates can support recruitment and retention of talent.

Critics of rapid tax rate reductions warn that cuts could reduce crucial revenue for public services, including education, infrastructure and health programs. They argue that without careful budget planning — especially in states with unpredictable revenue cycles — tax cuts might force cuts to essential services or future tax hikes.

FAQs:

Q: Which states cut income tax rates on January 1, 2026, and by how much?

A: Eight states lowered their income tax rates effective Jan. 1, 2026. Indiana’s flat rate fell to 2.95 %, Kentucky to 3.5 %, Mississippi to 4 %, Montana’s top rate dropped to 5.65 %, Nebraska’s top rate fell to 4.55 %, North Carolina to 3.99 %, Ohio simplified to a flat 2.75 %, and Oklahoma reduced its top rate to 4.5 %.

Q: How will these state income tax cuts affect residents and economic growth?

A: Residents will see more take-home pay and smaller state tax bills in 2026. States expect the cuts to encourage consumer spending, attract workers, and boost business investment. Some states, like Indiana and Nebraska, have multi-year reduction plans, while Ohio simplified brackets to make taxation more transparent and predictable for taxpayers.

So, the data acquisition and the optionality are the key.” “The scenario planning is the easy part.","Manufacturers can adapt their preparations to address the risks and opportunities being driven by federal policy. For some manufacturers, the top issue is the ongoing concern about workforce.

Workforce alternatives

“Even if you don’t have undocumented workers, you might have someone with a family member that is,” Schindler said. “So, they might not show up to work one day because they’re fearful for their family member or they’re taking care of them.” She said that some companies are setting up HR programs to help proactively identify and address these potential issues.

Another way to mitigate workforce shortages is to look at recruitment from non-traditional sources. This approach might also require restructuring shifts or work. “Stay-at-home parents might be available while they have kids in school, or you might need to look at other types of workers that you didn’t before.”

Eaton agreed, “I believe that you’re going to have fewer workers, so the people who would have had a hard time getting a job could become a pool of resources.” For instance, he noted, there are federal programs to help employers consider hiring formerly incarcerated workers:

Pathway Home Grants: In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor committed $25 million for pre‑release training and employment services to help people transition to connect incarcerated adults with apprenticeships, occupational training, and legal assistance before their release.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC): This is a federal tax credit of up to $9,600 per hire, for businesses employing eligible ex-offenders.

Second Chance Act: This is a federal law administered by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, providing grants to organizations that support job training, placement and education for people leaving incarceration.

Reentry Employment Opportunities: This is a U.S. Department of Labor initiative (under WIOA Section 169), funding state and local programs that test employment strategies for justice‑involved adults and youth.

Automotive: Workforce alternatives and development is an area where the automotive sector has provided leading examples of what can be done. Manufacturers in other sectors have looked to automakers for strategies that can help overcome workforce issues.

One workforce alternative that always generates discussion is automation — and OBBBA provides some incentives for tech modernization, but effective automation requires an effective strategy. “Then, you should also look at up-]skilling workers to take higher-responsibility roles as automation or AI agents take lower-responsibility roles,” Schindler said.

As manufacturers consider which strategies will enable them to capitalize on current opportunities and mitigate potential risks, whether workforces-related or otherwise, they can improve the clarity and accuracy of their planning with scenario modeling. However, effective scenario modeling can be difficult. “As you’re trying to figure out what all of your options are, you also need to determine how to model them in a way that gives you a good answer,” Eaton said. “It has to be defined the right way.”

Effective scenario modeling

The recent changes in federal policy provide an excellent reason to use scenario modeling — but they’re not the only reason. “People are already modeling,” Eaton said, “and some have been doing it for a long time.” Yet, the exercise is not always effective.

“There are a lot of leaders who feel like they’re doing scenario modeling, but they’re not getting the most out of it, or maybe they’re not doing it right,” Schindler said. “At a recent conference, there was a whole session on why scenario planning fails: The biggest reason is that people do the scenario modeling, but then they’re afraid to act on it.” This hesitation is often caused by a lack of confidence in the results.

To get the right results from your scenario models, you need the right options and inputs.

“Any talented analytical person can build the model or scenario. It’s knowing how to define scenarios and what’s an option or what’s not,” Eaton said. “The issue is that nobody’s model is the same. Even if you’re solving for the same outcome, the inputs into the model are different. So, the data acquisition and the optionality are the key.”

“The scenario planning is the easy part. It’s actually defining the scenarios the right way and understanding the optionality — that’s where the gold’s at.”

Eaton outlined how some companies could create scenarios for choosing suppliers that don’t incur tariffs, or that allow them to take other actions in response to evolving federal policies — if they understand those options and how to capture them. “Your model has to be defined the right way. The scenario planning is the easy part. It’s actually defining the scenarios the right way and understanding the optionality — that’s where the gold’s at.”

Eaton outlined some fundamental steps to analyze your business and build an effective model for trade and tariff issues:

Map your supply chain: “The first step is to map the supply chain operating model and understand, from a physical perspective, where your operations are, where your suppliers are and how that impacts you from a trade perspective,” Eaton said.

Identify your options: “Think through the optionality to address the impact of tariffs, if that’s the biggest issue,” Eaton said. “I actually think the bigger issues are often the other unmitigated risks that impact suppliers. Many companies need to have a better understanding of where the inputs into the products that they manufacture are coming from.”

Examine regulations: “Once you understand the risk factors within your supply chain network, and where your exposure is from a trade and tariff perspective, then you can overlay the regulatory aspect,” Eaton said. It’s important for your model to help you understand when regulatory restrictions do or don’t affect potential decisions.

Financial reconciliation: “Then, there’s the financial reconciliation,” Eaton said. “That includes what may or may not make sense from a tax perspective or from a strategic business continuity perspective.”

To manage shifting tariff impacts while weighing the opportunities presented by OBBBA tax incentives, manufacturers need to optimize their decisions with a range of factors.

This diagram shows that a tax-effective supply chain planning scenario model needs to consider factors from three areas:

Strategic planning

Operational and financial planning

Tax planning

The strategic planning factors include:

Growth strategy and scalability requirements

Risk to supply chain operating model

End-to-end physical supply chain networks

The operational and financial planning factors include:

Intersection of customer segments and SKU performance

Intrinsic supply chain cost to serve trend

Cash conversion cycle

The tax planning factors include:

Tax strategy and methods

Transfer pricing

Trade and tariff implications

State and local tax incentives

With effective and accurate scenario models, manufacturers can adapt their decisions for emerging issues or even review decisions they’ve already made.

“How do you look at trading partners and make sure that the people you’re working with are the best for you?” Eaton asked. “How do you look at your operating model and determine if this is really the only location that you can produce a product, or if you would be better served to produce it elsewhere? Would you be better served to look at making versus buying — or to not make some products at all, just buy a finished good and resell it?”

These questions could have important answers for your business, but the inputs are complex and unique.

“It’s a matter of looking at the dimensions that affect your decisions and coming to a reconciliation of the outcome,” Eaton said. “That’s something that people have to realize: There isn’t an off-the-shelf answer.”

The officials blame the oil companies for environmental damage to the Louisiana coast from decades of oil and gas production.
Federal court is seen as a friendlier venue for the oil companies.
Although that company had withdrawn from the Supreme Court petition, it remained a party in federal court, according to a letter from the court clerk.
The oil companies argue the law applies in this matter because of World War II-era fuel-supply contracts.","The Supreme Court justices on Monday heard arguments in a lawsuit seeking to hold oil companies liable for environmental damage to Louisiana’s coastline.

The argument focused on a narrow question — whether the oil companies can remove cases over the damage from state to federal court — but the stakes are high.

Local officials in Louisiana have filed more than 40 related lawsuits seeking potentially billions of dollars in damages. The officials blame the oil companies for environmental damage to the Louisiana coast from decades of oil and gas production. They argue that the companies engaged in illegal activity, by drilling, dredging and engaging in waste disposal without proper permits. Those actions, state officials argue, have contributed to extensive coastal erosion.

Federal court is seen as a friendlier venue for the oil companies. If the justices allow the companies to move their cases there, it could have implications for other climate change-related lawsuits. Such lawsuits have increased in recent years as states and local governments face increasing challenges with how to pay for environmental damage. Oil companies have argued they pose a threat to the country’s energy security.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh pressed the lawyer for a coalition of major oil companies, Paul D. Clement, about why they have sought to move the lawsuits out of state courts in local parishes, which are similar to counties.

“There seems to be a concern about the fairness of the state court system that underlies your position in this case,” Justice Kavanaugh said. “What is that concern?”

Mr. Clement responded that a judgment issued in federal court would be more broadly accepted. If the plaintiffs can prove their case in federal court, then “everybody’s going to accept the outcome” and the decision would not be viewed “as something that’s a product of local prejudice.”

He cited examples where national policies have been locally unpopular, making it potentially difficult for the companies to get a fair trial with a local jury. Last April, a jury in Plaquemines Parish, the state’s southernmost parish, found Chevron Corporation liable for about $745 million for damage to the state’s coastal wetlands.

Lawyers for Louisiana have fought to keep the cases in state courts.

Louisiana’s solicitor general, J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, said state courts were best suited to judge whether the underlying law, a Louisiana environmental statute, had been violated.

“We have the same reasons for wanting to be in state court that anybody who sues under state law wants to be in state court,” Mr. Aguiñaga told the justices. “We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get to the Louisiana Supreme Court on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope.”

The argument, which lasted more than an hour, was muted. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who is often active in arguments and typically asks lively hypotheticals, recused himself from the case just days before the argument. He cited his financial ties to one of the companies involved in the dispute, ConocoPhillips, the parent corporation of Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company. Although that company had withdrawn from the Supreme Court petition, it remained a party in federal court, according to a letter from the court clerk.

The question of whether the oil companies can successfully get the cases into federal court hinges on what’s known as the federal officer removal statute. This law gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil cases that concern the actions of federal officials or those acting under the orders of a federal official.

The oil companies argue the law applies in this matter because of World War II-era fuel-supply contracts. The Trump administration has joined the case in support of the oil companies.

A federal trial court rejected the companies’ argument, finding that they had failed to show their oil removal was done under the orders of a federal officer.

A divided panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit then upheld the lower court’s decision, blocking the companies from moving cases to federal court.

Unlike the trial court, the judges found that the oil companies had been operating under federal officials at the time of the World War II oil extraction. But a majority concluded that the oil companies failed to show that actions the jury said caused environmental damage were related to the company’s World War II-era fuel contracts.

Mr. Aguiñaga urged the justices to uphold that decision. He asserted that it was “an easy case,” that the oil companies had “dumped billions of gallons of produced water from oil wells directly into our marsh” and that it was “a massive deal for the state of Louisiana.”

Mr. Clement pushed back aggressively on this idea, telling the justices that it was clear the oil companies had worked in support of the country’s war, both on the battlefield and on “the home front.”

He called the war context of the oil company contracts “critical,” adding that the companies were fueling munitions factories, among other industries.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12dc-scotus-oil-lkwg/12dc-scotus-oil-lkwg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:01:52.361524

Denver, CO — On Friday, the EPA disapproved Colorado’s Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, again illegally undermining the state’s efforts to rein in pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources. The state’s plan includes retirement deadlines for coal plants that several utilities voluntarily proposed and asked the state to include in its plan. The plan was broadly supported by the state, utilities, industry, and environmental groups. Yet the Trump administration has once again tried to override decisions made by local utilities.

Under the Clean Air Act and federal Regional Haze Rule, states must reduce air pollution and improve air quality in national parks and wilderness areas. Regional haze plans also provide crucial health benefits for communities. In its disapproval of Colorado’s plan, the EPA claims the voluntary coal plant retirements included in the state’s plan would harm grid reliability, but this is incorrect because the state and the utilities have long planned to retire the coal plants and to replace their generation with cheaper and cleaner resources. EPA initially proposed a partial disapproval of Colorado’s haze plan, but the final rule released rejects the entire plan. Colorado’s plan fully complies with the Clean Air Act. EPA’s overreach in disapproving the plan is unwarranted and will harm Coloradans and result in dirtier air in Rocky Mountain National Park and other treasured public lands.

This news follows a recent illegal 202© order from the Department of Energy to prevent the planned retirement of Unit 1 at Craig Station. The order threatens to raise ratepayers’ utility bills and worsen air quality for surrounding communities. According to an analysis by Grid Strategies, if the plant is dispatched at its average output over the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, equating to approximately $85 million per year, or even upwards of $150 million per year if the plant is required to operate in must-run fashion.

“This is yet another unwarranted attempt by the Trump administration to prevent the long-planned retirements of Colorado’s expensive, dirty, and unreliable coal plants,” said Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. “The Trump administration’s ideological attacks on Colorado’s energy policies are illegal and will increase costs for customers, as clean energy in Colorado is far cheaper than coal.”

“EPA’s decision to disapprove Colorado’s plan is dangerous for Colorado’s national parks and for everyone who values clean, healthy air,” said Tracy Coppola, Colorado senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Millions of people visit our parks each year to experience the once-in-a-lifetime views, but pollution from coal plants continues to threaten the experience at Rocky Mountain, Great Sand Dunes and Black Canyon. Coloradans deserve a plan that protects the places we love for future generations. Dirty air is not the legacy we want to leave behind.”

“Trump’s attempts to prevent utilities from retiring uneconomic coal plants will increase electricity prices and deadly air pollution,” said Margaret Kran-Annexstein, director of the Colorado Chapter of the Sierra Club. “The EPA has abandoned its environmental mission in favor of propping up the dying coal industry. Utilities voluntarily decided to retire aging coal plants in Colorado because it would save customers money and reduce pollution, and EPA has no business overriding these local and state decisions.”

FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF EXPANSION CONCEPT STUDIES HYPROMAG USA ADVANCES EXPANSION TO THREE STATES SUPPORTING A PATH TO

TRIPLE U.S. RARE EARTH MAGNET CAPACITY BY 2029

· Completed concept studies for expansion of South Carolina and Nevada hubs, increasing total HyProMag USA magnet and alloy production from 1,552 metric tons NdFeB to 4,656 metric tons NdFeB per annum, supporting scalable U.S. manufacturing strategy and reinforcing momentum towards a planned U.S. public listing

· Greater than $2 billion post-tax NPV and 38.7% real IRR for expanded developments, based on forecast market prices[i], support commencement of pre-feasibility studies for the expansions

London / Vancouver: 12 January 2026 - Mkango Resources Ltd (AIM / TSX-V:MKA) (the ""Company"" or ""Mkango"") is pleased to announce an update from HyProMag USA, LLC (""HyProMag USA"") on the completion of expansion concept studies (the ""Expansion Concept Study"") and the commencement of pre-feasibility studies for HyProMag USA's Plants located in South Carolina and Nevada, marking a significant step toward tripling its domestic manufacturing capacity by 2029. The studies support HyProMag USA's strategy to build a scalable platform across the U.S. for recycled neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets and reinforce the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. public listing.

The basis of the expansion studies is the recently completed Class 2 AACE[ii] capital cost estimate as part of the Detailed Engineering Design and Value Engineering Phase (the ""Detailed Design"") of the Company's first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denton County, Texas (the ""Texas Hub"" or the ""Project"").[iii]

The Texas Hub 2025 Detailed Design base case was based on operating three Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scrap (""HPMS"") vessels, with a post-tax Net Present Value (""NPV"") applying a 7% discount rate of $409 million based on current market prices, and a post-tax NPV of $780 million based on forecast prices.

The pre-feasibility studies for each of the South Carolina and Nevada hubs will focus on site selection, saleable products and Project configuration, optimal site layout, permitting, logistics, and technical marketing.

Key Highlights of the Expansion Concept Study

· Expansion targets increase magnet and NdFeB Alloy Powder Production capacity by 3x from 1,552 metric tons NdFeB to 4,656 metric tons NdFeB by 2029 across three hubs, in Texas, South Carolina, and Nevada.

· Concept Study focused on the development of modular production systems and evaluated three investment scenarios based on the following modular configurations:

o Case 1 - NdFeB Alloy Powder Production (HPMS[iv] only) - (Module 1)

o Case 2 - NdFeB Alloy Powder Production + Sintered Block Production (Modules 1 & 2)

o Case 3 - Fully Integrated Production: NdFeB Alloy Powder Production + Sintered Block + Magnet Finishing and Packaging (Modules 1, 2 and 3)

· Each site was envisioned as a brownfield development with no space or utility constraints, enabling optimized layouts and flexible future expansions

· The studies included conceptual building layouts, building options, environmental and permitting Roadmaps, Capital Cost Estimate (Class 4 AACE), and the basis of estimate

· Project schedule assumes the commissioning of three Plants between 2027 and 2029 and does not include an expansion of the Texas Hub

· Conceptual valuation: Concept study results for rare earth magnet recycling and manufacturing operations in the United States with a Texas Hub supported by two additional hubs (Case 3) co-located with Intelligent Lifecycle Solution (""ILS"") sites in South Carolina and Nevada[v]:

o $1,143 million post-tax NPV[vi] and 27.6% real internal rate of return (IRR) based on current market prices[vii],[viii]

o $2,180 million post-tax NPV and 38.7% real IRR based on forecast market prices[ix]

· Increased magnet production capacity: 2,823 metric tons per annum of recycled sintered neodymium-iron-boron (""NdFeB"") magnets and 1,833 metric tons per annum of associated NdFeB co-products (total payable capacity - 4,656 metric tons NdFeB) over a 40-year operating life from 2029.

· Pre-feasibility study magnet optimization expected to increase higher value sintered block production

· Industrial and workforce impact: The Plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create circa 300 skilled magnet manufacturing jobs

· Feedstock security: Plants in South Carolina and Nevada are co-located with ILS[x] facilities, expansions would be conditional on securing adequate feedstock and offtake

· Carbon profile: Independent ISO-compliant study for the Texas Hub 2024 feasibility study confirmed a very low-carbon footprint of 2.35 kg CO2-eq per kg of NdFeB sintered block product [xi]

· Scoping Studies: led by PegasusTSI Inc. (U.S.) and BBA USA Inc. (Canada), with support from HyProMag's international teams and the University of Birmingham

Building Momentum Toward U.S. Commercial Scale

The Expansion Concept Study build on a series of recent milestones for HyProMag USA, including detailed engineering and feasibility work on the Texas Hub, execution of the site lease[xii] at the Ironhead Commerce Center, and the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. public listing. Together these developments reflect accelerating momentum as HyProMag USA advances toward commercial operations and a scaled, manufacturing footprint across the U.S.

In parallel, HyProMag USA is engaging with large technology and infrastructure operators to support the growing need for secure, domestic recycling solutions for magnet-bearing equipment used in hyperscale data centers and AI infrastructure. The Company's modular, low carbon, magnet-to-magnet recycling platform is designed to support end-of-life recovery of rare earth materials from servers, storage systems, and related equipment, positioning HyProMag USA as a preferred long-term recycling and manufacturing partner for hyperscale customers as capacity expands in the United States.

Julian Treger, CoTec CEO commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA's Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform. The modular design allows us to replicate capacity efficiently, optimize products for U.S. customers, and accelerate domestic supply chain resilience. With the commissioning of HyProMag plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, along with recent progress on the Texas Hub, materially strengthens HyProMag USA's readiness for the next phase of growth and capital markets engagement.""

Will Dawes, Mkango CEO commented: ""HyProMag USA continues to develop a strong platform for further growth in the United States, and the recently completed Expansion Concept Study further validates the Company's business model and strategic positioning. In parallel with commissioning of the plants in UK and Germany, HyProMag USA is progressing rapidly towards first production in 2027, making a significant contribution to development of robust rare earth supply chains globally.""

The website was the primary hub for the DoE’s PR100 study, as the Department has invested over two years, and millions of dollars, into PR100 to develop strategies to fulfill its mandated goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050. This goal was established because Puerto Rico’s electrical system has historically been documented to have reliability challenges with worsening outage metrics, reaching levels significantly worse than the U.S. average.

“PR100 is part of an important initiative to help transition the archipelago from a grid facing high costs and significant operational difficulties to a more affordable and resilient clean energy system that can deliver energy security to the people of Puerto Rico,” the lawmaker wrote. “The website was crucial for the study to succeed by providing direct public access to the study, including summaries and raw data. The removal of the website diminishes the study’s ability to help guide federal and local efforts to support Puerto Rico’s renewable energy goals.”

The letter notes that the Department of Energy has also recently canceled billions of dollars in Puerto Rican renewable energy infrastructure project funding and loans, which is impacting planned transition efforts. The removal of the PR100 website complicates the DoE’s original mission to ensure America’s security and prosperity by addressing energy and environmental challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.

The letter concludes with a request that the website be reinstated no later than February 12, 2026.

In addition to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, the letter was cosigned by Representatives Brendan Boyle (PA-02), André Carson (IN-07), Ed Case (HI-01), Sean Casten (IL-06), Judy Chu (CA-28), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), Daniel Goldman (NY-10), Pablo Hernández (D-PR), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Ted Lieu (CA-36), Grace Meng (NY-06), Jerrold Nadler (NY-12), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), Mark Takano (CA-39), Ritchie Torres (NY-15), and Nydia Velázquez (NY-07).

As a result, polluting coal and methane gas power plants stay online longer, accelerating climate change and further burdening consumers with costly power bills.
Georgia utility regulatory staff noted that the planned gas plant buildout would double the utility’s “ratebase,” sharply increasing utility bills across the board.
In other words, cutting utility profits unlocks more opportunity for community-owned clean energy resources that lower bills and build wealth.
Even amid backsliding at the federal level, the climate movement can make real progress in states and localities by targeting excessive utility profits and promoting non-utility clean energy.","Doused by illegal federal actions and swamped by a mounting affordability crisis, the climate movement can re-ignite by targeting for-profit utilities. Many in the climate movement have been demoralized by the Trump administration’s evisceration of the Inflation Reduction Act. Inflation, tariffs, and data centers have put climate concerns in the back seat to affordability among political leaders and ordinary Americans. Meanwhile, utility companies have clung to slow, expensive fossil fuel infrastructure that pads their bottom line, rather than making fast and affordable clean energy investments. Climate leaders can revitalize the movement by rallying against excessive utility profits and showing how climate-friendly, local clean energy policies can bring relief to the millions of Americans struggling to pay their bills.

Utilities have earned the opportunity to be villains. While delivering an essential public service, for-profit electric utilities make billions of dollars per year from inflated profits alone. Multiple studies suggest that the average American household, given no choice over the utility that delivers their electricity, pays nearly $300 extra per year to pad the wallets of utility shareholders. This pain disproportionately falls on historically marginalized communities and low-income households. Utilities pour these ill-gotten gains into political donations, advertising, and lavish retreats to forestall any serious accountability from state utility regulators.

Utilities have also delayed the energy transition by using their monopoly over the grid to hinder clean energy deployment. Utilities block grid connections for community solar, lobby to cut compensation for rooftop solar, and deliberately avoid building new power lines to connect affordable clean energy that might harm their own bottom line. As a result, polluting coal and methane gas power plants stay online longer, accelerating climate change and further burdening consumers with costly power bills.

Utilities have seized upon data centers to double down on their love for costly fossil fuels and the attendant profits. Georgia Power, for example, told regulators they need to build numerous new methane gas-fired power plants to meet a utility-projected 10,000 megawatts of new capacity. With a lifetime of 40 years or more, the plants would burden the atmosphere and utility customers with volatile prices and high costs for decades. They’d also enrich the utility, which makes an excessive profit on top of the cost of building new power plants and other infrastructure — even when other measures like energy efficiency would cost ratepayers less. Georgia utility regulatory staff noted that the planned gas plant buildout would double the utility’s “ratebase,” sharply increasing utility bills across the board. Like all for-profit utilities, Georgia Power’s excessive profit rate gives it a strong bias to build, build, build (mostly dirty energy).

Slaying the utility profit monster lowers bills and opens the door to many more affordable, emission-reducing solutions. Obviously, lower profits paid to utility shareholders means lower bills. Additionally, curtailing excessive profit margins for building new stuff also means that utilities have a reduced incentive to do so — and to block energy efficiency, independently owned clean energy, and other climate-friendly measures that don’t make them money. In other words, cutting utility profits unlocks more opportunity for community-owned clean energy resources that lower bills and build wealth.

Marrying affordability and climate means switching from utility-owned fossil fueled power plants to independently owned clean ones. Policies like distributed power plants, for example, explicitly pay consumers and entrepreneurs fair value for meeting the needs of the grid. Laws enabling community solar and plug-in solar can ensure that people who don’t own a sunny rooftop can still transition to clean energy while reducing their bills. All of these policies reduce the utility ratebase, which puts additional downward pressure on electricity bills. But as long as utilities make double-digit profits on fossil fuel infrastructure investments, they’ll have the incentive, power, and money to stymie these urgently-needed policy shifts.

Utilities have never been friends in the fight against climate change, nor champions of affordability. Even amid backsliding at the federal level, the climate movement can make real progress in states and localities by targeting excessive utility profits and promoting non-utility clean energy.",https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-markusspiske-2559749-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:13:40.265300

After the Department of the Interior transmitted Public Land Order 7917 to Congress, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN) announced plans to introduce a CRA resolution to overturn the 2023 mining ban. If successful, the effort would not only reverse this specific withdrawal but would also establish that Public Land Orders are subject to congressional review — curbing similar executive actions issued without congressional oversight in the future.

“This constitutes a positive, major shift in policy and a potential breakthrough for miners, rural communities, and anyone affected by the regulatory ‘ping-pong’ on federal lands,” said Pacific Legal Foundation Federal Policy Director Joe Luppino-Esposito. “Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply. When executive actions can shut down lawful exploration overnight, it weakens investment, domestic production, and our ability to secure critical resources at home.”

Pacific Legal Foundation has been actively advancing the legal theory underlying this move, engaging the White House, the Department of the Interior, and members of Congress to argue that Public Land Orders constitute rules and must be submitted under the CRA. No prior administration has taken this step.

The Stauber resolution opens the door for Congress to review — and potentially overturn — not just one Public Land Order, but all such executive land withdrawals. Once a CRA disapproval is issued, the rule cannot be reissued in substantially similar form by the executive, thereby providing long-needed certainty for miners and land users. Similar restrictions could be instituted only with congressional action.

From her small hometown of Modeste, in Ascension Parish, Lavigne, 20, commutes every week to undergraduate classes in New Orleans. She’d much rather drive over an hour to school than move away from the beloved, predominantly Black community where her family has lived for decades.

She is the fifth generation of her family to live in this white clapboard house in Modeste facing the grassy Mississippi River levee. She sleeps in the same room her grandfather grew up in, shaded by sprawling oak trees, and spends her spare time rescuing dogs with her mom. Her grandmother is legendary environmental justice advocate Sharon Lavigne.

“We take care of each other down here,” Makaelyn Lavigne said on a recent afternoon, as she sat on a bench at the Modeste playground, sugar cane fields stretching away behind her. Her memories are of a community built around families and nature: “My grandpa dug a pond for us when we were younger so we could fish. We go tracking bobcats in the woods. They have eagles that nest across the river.”

Today, eagles above Modeste fly through some of the country’s most polluted air. Unprecedented petrochemical buildouts have changed Lavigne’s paradise. Her grandmother, Sharon Lavigne, a retired schoolteacher, has garnered worldwide attention with her ongoing battles against companies like Formosa and CF Industries. But the Lavigne family – and hundreds of others in Modeste – may soon be forced to leave their homes as petrochemical companies push to build a massive multi-corporation chemical industrial park that could turn Ascension into “Ammonia Parish.”

The targeted stretch of land abuts neighborhoods and homes like the Lavigne’s. To clear the way for the project, called the RiverPlex MegaPark, companies eyeing the development have begun to hire real estate firms. The firms have already made buyout offers to some residents, including Ashley Gaignard, a resident of Ascension Parish and campaigner with Rural Roots, who described them as low-ball offers.

But in October, Gaignard found a way to throw up some roadblocks in the march towards industrial development. Rural Roots is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit – inspired by a Caddo Parish lawsuit by Attorney General Liz Murrill herself. It challenges whether a parish council’s votes are legal if members do not vocally vote aloud.

Gaignard is trying to block the rezoning that allowed this massive industrial expansion in Ascension Parish. But four firms have already drawn up proposals for the Modeste buyout, while road crews are creating access roads for some facilities that begin construction next year. Besides Gaignard and her lawsuit, the only thing standing in the way of the MegaPark now are locals: residents here own some of the land surrounding the large-scale development.

If the widespread buyout moves forward as planned, it stands to change life here forever: it could essentially destroy Modeste and part of nearby Donaldsonville, displacing up to 800 residents. “It’s just very disheartening to see how they’re so willing to displace an entire community,” Lavigne said.

Ascension Parish Council did not respond to emailed questions about the buyout plan.

Residents are left faced with an impossible choice: those who refuse the buyout could be surrounded by industry belching harmful ammonia.

Ascension ranks high in the nation for air pollution

Ascension Parish sits in “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and New Orleans that’s home to a high concentration of petrochemical sites and carcinogenic pollution. The parish is among the top 10 counties in the country for air pollution: the CF Industries plant in Donaldsonville is the nation’s single largest toxic air polluter by pound, averaging more than a dozen unauthorized discharges per year.

Just upriver from Donaldsonville sits Modeste: a small but historically important unincorporated community, surrounded by sugarcane fields and agricultural land.

Centuries ago, the community was home to the plantation Babin Place, which in 1911 was purchased by a Black benevolent society that renamed it New Africa Farm. The society opened rural schools for children around Modeste. Later still, the farm was the home of Leonard Julien Sr., the Black inventor of the sugarcane-planting machine.

Now, said Lavigne, the town of Modeste is home to many grandparents, mostly Black and working-class people. As with many rural areas across the nation, young people often leave town in the face of dwindling job opportunities, leaving behind villages that are mostly made up of elders, who yearn for a local job market that could once again sustain their kids and grandkids, instead of the depressed agricultural economy.

Those realities can make it tough for places like Ascension Parish to fend off industry – even if it comes with waves of new pollution, potential leaks, and explosions.

Modeste faces its own hurdles. As an incorporated community, its voters did not get a say in the election of Donaldsonville Mayor Leroy Sullivan, one of the key boosters of the new industrial park.

Like the entire Ascension Parish Council, Sullivan supports the new development. The promised economic boom is the draw for him, though he is clearly aware of the dangers, as a survivor of a 2000 explosion at the Donaldsonville CF Industries plant that killed a contractor. Burned across most of his body, Sullivan spent 37 days recovering in a burn unit. His hands, Lavigne said, still bear the scars.

Gaignard doesn’t understand how any Ascension Parish leaders entrusted to protect their residents can open the door for the industrial park. “The same people that you went knocking on their door for a vote, these are the same people now saying, ‘You got to move. You have to go. We don’t have a place for you to go. All we know is you need to go,’” she said.

Ascension Parish plans to build the sprawling RiverPlex MegaPark industrial expansion across 17,000 acres. When completed, Modeste will be surrounded by heavy industry. Ammonia production in the area could more than quadruple.

Ultimately, it’s a choice between leaving a cherished community and living next to what could be Cancer Alley’s densest source of pollution yet. “They’re telling people it’s a choice, right? ‘If you want to go,’” Gaignard said. “But we all know it’s not safe to live that close to three industries being right on the next side of your fence.”

Beyond the current CF Industries facilities, the proposed park would add an ammonia plant from Clean Hydrogen Works, a Hyundai steel plant, a “blue” ammonia plant from CF Industries and multiple Japanese companies. The term “blue” ammonia is the term used for ammonia produced using “carbon capture,” a disputed technology that purports to capture carbon from smokestacks. Though it is positioned as a way to cut carbon pollution, by either storing it underground or using it to produce more oil, many environmental advocates warn that it only provides cover for polluters.

Ascension Parish and the state of Louisiana are helping to fund the park and related road and rail expansions using a $600 million taxpayer-funded incentive package.

Laying the groundwork for Modeste’s buyout

In May, the Ascension Parish Council approved a resolution to begin exploring a buyout for more than 200 residents. In August, the Council put out a call for firms to develop a Relocation and Buyout Plan.

Four firms submitted bids in response, vying to lead Ascension Parish’s buyout. As of November, none of the firms had been awarded a contract, but The Lens obtained their applications through public record requests.

All four firms have Louisiana ties. One firm, Grant Management Group, is partnering with Middleberg Riddle Group, who count New Orleans City Councilmember JP Morrell as counsel. Another, Ahearn-Alecha Architecture, is led by Matthew Ahearn, founder of New Orleans’ Irish Cultural Museum; their rates for the proposed work are up to $250 per hour.

The other two firms – Timbalier Resources and Desire Line – list partners who count previous work on the resettlement of Isle de Jean Charles as among their qualifications.

“Our team members developed a deep understanding of the sensitivities inherent in requesting families to transfer ownership of property held for generations,” Desire Line wrote of the Isle de Jean Charles project.

That resettlement has been critiqued for the tribe’s loss of self-determination, cultural displacement, and substandard housing at the new site.

To complete the buyouts more quickly, some of the MegaPark companies have hired real estate firms directly, who are already making insultingly low offers to residents, Gaignard said.

“They’re giving buyouts, but the buyouts are really not worth the property,” she said. “I have one gentleman that has their house on an acre of land, and they were offering $150,000. And they’re in their 80s, and they’re like: ‘Where can we go and buy a house [for that low a sum?]”

The offer is less than half the median sale price of a home in Ascension Parish, according to realty website Redfin.

Gaignard said she’s particularly concerned for vulnerable elders in her community, who would struggle if relocated.

Challenging the rezoning

The first steps towards the industrial park’s development came in 2015, when the Ascension Parish Council adopted an ordinance creating the 17,000-acre West Bank Industrial Overlay District. The ordinance made it much easier to rezone land around Modeste from “conservation” to “industrial.”

Developers have been treating that industrial zoning as a given. Even as the rezoning process is challenged, the Ascension Economic Development Corp. advertises the industrial future of the RiverPlex MegaPark.

In August 2025, the Ascension Parish Council voted twice in two weeks to rezone parcels of land for the MegaPark. On August 7, by approving two agenda items, the Council gave industrial zoning to more than 3,400 acres of conservation land in the area planned for the RiverPlex MegaPark.

But the process was questionable, the Rural Roots suit alleges.

When hearing the agenda item, the chair of the council, Chase Melancon, did not receive an audible “yea” vote from every councilmember. Instead, Melancon asked aloud: “Any questions? Any objections? Hearing none, so moved,” and then gaveled the vote through, after waiting less than a second.

Melancon followed the same process on August 21, 2025, when the Council rezoned over 900 acres of land expressly for CF Industries Blue Point LLC, the planned carbon capture facility.

Altogether, the Rural Roots lawsuit challenges the rezoning of about a quarter of the land intended for the MegaPark.

Low-ball buyout offers

Jack Green, a campaign manager with Rise St. James, first learned about the Ascension Parish buyout because Modeste residents were so upset that they drove to St. James looking for help from Rise St. James’ founder, Sharon Lavigne.

Green believes developers are deliberately “building a bunch of industrial access roads right now and using eminent domain to cut up the current housing there.” He thinks this will make it easier for developers to “intimidate the residents into accepting a buyout they don’t want to accept.”

The access roads dividing the neighborhood, as described by Green, are likely in service of the Hyundai Motor Group’s $5.8 billion steel plant, which will begin construction in 2026. Earlier this year, Hyundai executives raised concerns with Louisiana Economic Development about the company’s need for expanded and accelerated road construction in Ascension Parish. The state responded that it was reviewing options to speed up the area road improvements.

Green sees the early buyout offers as part of a broader plan to short-circuit community opposition in Modeste. “There is a coordinated effort,” he said, “between the parish, the state, these industries, and some very, very wealthy real estate firms, to intimidate and get residents out and prevent any kind of solidarity between the residents.”

Hyundai is one of the companies that has jumped ahead to make buyout offers outside the Parish-approved process.

Law firm Kurz & Hebert sent a letter on behalf of Hyundai to Donaldsonville resident Paul Troxclair, who shared it with Green.

“We realize that [address] is your primary residence and want to be sensitive to that,” the August 27 letter reads. “As a result of Hyundai’s experience, they realize their industrial development could negatively affect the neighbors and the value of their property in the future which is the reason behind the offer.”

Hyundai offered Troxclair $395,000, he said, for his two adjoining properties, which together have a market value of $366,700, according to the Ascension Parish Assessor’s Office. But while the offer is 8% above the assessed value, Troxclair said he’s made improvements to the property and added value since it was last assessed in 2024.

Troxclair also knows from first-hand experience that the cost of displacement is far higher than the market value of property: he has been displaced once before, six years ago, from Iberville Parish. That time it was for an expansion by Shintech, a Japanese chemical manufacturer.

Besides the actual costs of moving, some things can’t be packed up nor replaced, Troxclair explained. On his family land in Iberville, “we had orange trees, satsuma trees,” he recalls. “Pecan trees that we picked in the yard since we were kids – they didn’t compensate us for none of our trees or anything like that. And I spent 60 years of my life down there. And they got people here [in Modeste] that’s been here a lot longer than that.”

The TJC Group, a consultant group speaking for Hyundai, told The Lens that “as of December 31, 2025, all the land needed for the development of Hyundai’s Louisiana Steel Mill has been voluntarily sold to the state of Louisiana,” and the State will lease it to Hyundai. “Hyundai is not currently working with Kurz & Hebert or any other real estate firm.”

This summer, Gene Landry, Mekaelyn Lavigne’s grandfather, was also among those who received an offer. His offer, also from a firm representing Hyundai, was so low he threw it away, he said. And even if it were fair, he said, he wouldn’t want to leave a place that has been in his family for more than 100 years.

Black Modeste residents vulnerable

Beyond their fears of low buyout offers, Modeste residents are vulnerable in other ways. Some who face displacement are renters, not homeowners. Others face property-title hurdles that are themselves the legacy of racism.

Land successions are difficult for big families. Ownership can end up spread across numerous extended family members, and so one hold-out cousin can stop or delay a sale. Untangling property rights can be nearly impossible for land that has been held in the same families for generations as society and its laws changed around them. “Those people don’t have a title, or it has been tied up between so many family members because they are the descendants of slaves and sharecroppers living there,” Gaignard said.

Industrial development in Cancer Alley is disproportionately concentrated in majority-Black areas like Modeste.

Public opinion is likewise split along racial lines. A recent survey in Ascension and St. James Parishes, commissioned by Sierra Club’s Delta Chapter, found that 65% of Black respondents are “very concerned” about toxic air and pollution in their community, as opposed to just 24% of white respondents. Asked whether local and state elected officials are doing enough to protect the public’s health from pollution, 40% of Black respondents strongly disagreed, compared with just 17% of white voters.

Though some jurisdictions designate areas for conservation purposes to protect natural habitats, Ascension Parish for decades kept the farmland within the MegaPark-site zoned for “conservation,” to prevent the historically Black area of Modeste from building up subdivisions, Gaignard said. If that was the intent in Ascension, it would follow national trends. Similar exclusionary zoning designations were made across the country, and supported by the federal government after World War II, as Black soldiers returned home and the modern Civil Rights movement began.

But the Ascension Parish Council changed course in 2015, when it created the Overlay to quickly make way for industry.

The legacy of enslavement flows directly into current-day rezoning efforts, Gaignard said. She imagines that local leaders have decided that since “free labor is no longer available, we need to figure out a way to make money off this land,” she said. “And if we can’t get it off sugar cane, we’ll sell it to industry and sell out the people that are left on the land.”

MegaPark companies may cause harm without delivering jobs, advocates fear

The specific companies who’ve set their sights on Ascension Parish – including Hyundai and CF Industries – raise alarms with some watchdogs, who warn that the corporations are likely to harm public health and destroy housing without bringing the promised economic benefits.

Concerns about Hyundai include its use of prison labor in Alabama, which drives down wages in Hyundai’s Southern manufacturing supply chain, according to a November report from Columbia University’s Labor Lab. In the Montgomery area, where Hyundai suppliers are concentrated, auto-supplier wages are 7% to 9% lower compared to similar jobs in Alabama and nearby states, the study found. Hyundai has not indicated whether it will seek to use prison labor in Louisiana.

“If Alabama already depends on incarcerated labor to subsidize Hyundai’s labor costs- with documented lower wages and higher health and safety violations – what prevents that same model from being replicated in Louisiana?” Gaignard said in a statement.

Another RiverPlex MegaPark company, CF Industries, has a plant near Yazoo City in Mississippi that suffered an explosion last month, leading to an ammonia leak and evacuations of nearby residents.

That worries some Modeste residents, because CF’s proposed plant in Ascension would be the largest in the world – three times larger than the Mississippi plant.

“I don’t understand how the same company that just put another community through an explosion and evacuation can now try to convince the people of Modeste and Ascension Parish that building a new ammonia plant is safe,” said Twila Collins, who lives just a mile from the proposed site in Modeste.

The lawsuit and “viva voce”

Gaignard took inspiration for the October lawsuit from a somewhat surprising place: a lawsuit by conservative Louisiana AG Liz Murrill. Both lawsuits challenge a voting approach common throughout Louisiana.

The argument is around the concept of “viva voce,” literally meaning “with the living voice.” It means that legislators must vote by speaking aloud – not with a show of hands, or using an electronic device, or being asked for an objection. The idea is to ensure transparency, as legislators may not vote in silence and thereby escape public scrutiny.

Rural Roots’ suit argues that Ascension Parish Council violated the Louisiana Constitution and Louisiana’s Open Meetings Law by simply asking for objections on the rezoning vote, sidestepping audible votes from every councilmember.

“The Louisiana Attorney General has recently pointed out that Louisiana law requires that voting by parish councils must be ‘viva voce,’” reads the lawsuit.

Murrill used a similar argument earlier this year to accuse Caddo Parish Council of violating the ‘viva voce’ requirement on a much more superficial matter: a resolution welcoming celebrated Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders to Shreveport.

A July vote ratifying “the Resolution Welcoming U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (“Sanders Resolution”) failed to comply with the viva voce voting requirements,” reads Murrill’s suit. “Any form of silent, electronic tallying that lacks an audible, spoken expression by each voting member is insufficient.”

If either is successful, the lawsuits could push other Louisiana parishes to change their voting practices. Currently, the Baton Rouge Metro Council typically votes through unanimous consent. Others, like the New Orleans City Council, vote electronically.

Gaignard and Murrill’s lawsuits could force a change. Bossier City has already dropped electronic voting as a result of Murrill’s suit. The New Orleans City Council is waiting to see how the lawsuit plays out.

Adrian Alpay, one of the lawyers on the Ascension case, told The Lens, “What we’re asking is pretty simple: that the members of the Ascension Parish Council follow state law and the Louisiana Constitution. The public has a right to observe how their government votes.”

If the suits are successful, they could make recent legislative votes vulnerable to challenges: suits filed within 60 days can void votes.

In December, Rural Roots and Bucket Brigade filed two more suits against Ascension Parish Council and Ascension Economic Development Corp. for withholding public records and keeping the deals shrouded in secrecy through non-disclosure agreements.

Gaignard isn’t interested in financial gain, and knows that even if it’s successful, the lawsuits filed around the MegaPark present more of a hurdle than a true roadblock. Still, she wants the councilmembers’ votes recorded. If the Modeste she knows is lost, she wants public records to show who chose to unstitch the fabric of their community.

“I just want accountability,” she said. “I want those leaders making this choice to forever have it in writing…them being the demise of their own community.”",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Buyouts_threaten_to_erase_Modeste-0467_2048px-thelensnola.png,N,,2026-01-12 14:04:34.009011

Here in the South, the inflation rate is lower than the national average, at 2.2%.","There is currently a “vibecession” occurring — a state defined by a persistent sense of malaise about the economy due to factors like high grocery prices and housing costs. What is really going on?

In evaluating North Carolina’s economy or, really, any economy, you want to know if the engine is growing, that there are enough jobs for people, that people can borrow at reasonable rates, and that the dollar you hold today is worth about the same as it did a year ago. If those four metrics are solid, we are good. Using Pareto’s 80/20 principle — the idea that 20% of any set of numbers constitutes 80% of the value of the entire set — we know that real GDP, the unemployment rate, interest rates, and inflation drive the vast majority of what is important.

If those four numbers are excellent and all other economic metrics are falling apart, we still get a B. If all other numbers are great and those four numbers are bad, we get an F. These metrics are the best hard data to confirm whether there is any meat to the malaise.

When rhetoric gets loud, look at the basic math.

Gross Domestic Product

First, consider gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is simply the value of all goods and services produced in a nation within a timeframe. Think of it as a state or country’s “top line” revenue. Nationally, we just saw third-quarter GDP growth accelerating to 4.3% — the highest rate in two years. Historically, anything above 3% is outstanding.

In North Carolina, our state’s real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.7% in the second quarter (the most recent data available), ranking us among the top states in the Southeast. That rate is expected to be 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in the final two quarters of 2025, according to estimates from UNC Charlotte’s North Carolina Economic Forecast. Based on everything we know about GDP today, our state and national economic engines are running smoothly. Real GDP — Check.

Unemployment

In contrast, nationally, unemployment sits at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Here at home, North Carolina’s unemployment rate has consistently hovered around 3.7% to 3.8%, below the national average. But even a look at the national average benefits from context. Economists consider “full employment” — where there is a good balance of job openings to unattached workers — to be about 5%. Too far below that and it can be considered a labor shortage. Since 1950, the average US unemployment rate has been about 5.7%. In 2020, it spiked to 14.8%. The math is simple: If you want a job today, the odds are heavily in your favor. Employment — Check.

Interest Rates

Next, interest rates. The Federal Reserve recently set a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Historically, 30-year mortgages run 2 to 3 percentage points higher than that rate, and they currently sit around 6%. We are in a cooling-off period after mortgage rates peaked near 8% in late 2023. If you are anchored to the sub-3% rates of 2020 — a once-in-a-century anomaly — 6% doesn’t feel so good. But the historical average since 1971 is 7.4%. North Carolina’s housing inventory is increasing, and we are currently borrowing at low rates compared to the last five decades. Interest rates — Check.

Inflation

Finally, the annual inflation rate in the US is currently around 2.7%. Here in the South, the inflation rate is lower than the national average, at 2.2%. Both rates are higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target but well below the 75-year average of 3.5%. Remember, the COVID-era high was 9.1% in June 2022. Things still “feel” bad because we are carrying the scars of the last few years. Prices aren’t dropping, but the speed of their increase has significantly slowed. We are still paying for the 24% total price hike endured since 2021, but the bleeding has stopped. With inflation at 2.7% nationally and 2.2% in North Carolina, the engine is cooling to a healthy temperature. Inflation — Check.

The Verdict

The answer: Despite the “vibecession” narrative, the economy is recovering. I think we get an A-minus, no matter who the teacher is — Democrat or Republican.

One last item. Who drives all these metrics? Certainly not the politicians. It is the small-business person. They create the jobs, growth and innovation. They build a healthy economy. Small businesses generated a net increase of almost 90% of all new jobs in North Carolina in the most recent annual period.

These businesses have been operating in a fog of mixed information and a quickly changing policy environment. Predictability is the oxygen needed for entrepreneurs because their lives are already upside down with risk. They need the certainty to plan, hire and invest. So, people, let’s not confuse the creators. It is time to move past the noise and get back to business.

People remain at the heart of nuclear’s progress — but with an aging workforce, tight supply of skilled candidates and intense competition, talent pipelines risk running dry as demand surges.

Nuclear development is more urgent with energy security under threat. Recent geopolitical shocks, such as the spike in gas and electricity prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, exposed the fragility of energy systems reliant on limited sources. Scaling nuclear power offers a pathway to greater market stability and long-term energy resilience.

Below, we provide a blueprint to manage risk and enable progress in nuclear investments across four pillars: SMR industrialization, life extension, project delivery, and workforce retention and attraction.

Trend 1: Challenge the FOAK Fallacy in SMRs

SMRs can replace decommissioned coal stations and serve a broad spectrum of users — from isolated communities to industrial hubs — making them ideal for decarbonization and brownfield deployment. Their modular architecture enables phased deployment, aligning capital expenditure with near-term load forecasts to reduce upfront financial risk. But to realize their full potential, developers must prioritize repeatability, standardization and proactive risk management.

Only a handful of SMRs are operational today — in Russia and China — while progress on new-build construction projects is gaining traction in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. Limited operational track records, alongside high capital costs, the volume of competing designs and regulatory uncertainty, continue to challenge insurability and investor confidence. To be widely deployed, small and advanced modular reactors must achieve a competitive levelized cost of electricity — estimates vary from $60/MWh to $140/MWh. Achieving this will depend on standardization and serial factory manufacturing.

Many view SMR projects as FOAK by default, but this is not always accurate. A significant number of leading SMR programs adapt proven Gen III and Gen III+ reactor designs with lower output to reduce technological and execution risk. Using established operational data and regulatory precedents helps streamline deployment and accelerate project maturity.

Even the classification of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs) as FOAK belies their historical context. In the U.S., SFR technology dates back to the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (1964–1994) and the Fast Flux Test Facility (1982–1992). France, Russia and Japan have also operated SFR prototypes for decades. While the concept isn’t new, SFRs have yet to be deployed commercially at scale.

Comprehensive insurable risk breakdowns conducted in collaboration with consultants and engineering teams can help secure design insurability and accelerate deployment.

The “silver tsunami” looms over the sector, which has a proportion of workers approaching retirement than both the wider energy workforce and national averages. Attracting new talent is increasingly competitive, with nuclear energy vying against technology and finance for top recruits. Yet Big Tech’s investment in nuclear to power artificial intelligence (AI) platforms is also helping to reshape the sector’s public image, making it more appealing to younger professionals.

Talent cultivation initiatives, like Destination Nuclear in the United Kingdom and the Nuclear Reactor Safety Training and Workforce Development Program in the U.S., aim to build the next generation of nuclear professionals — with safety top-of-mind. Mentorship, knowledge transfer and frameworks from the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Association of Nuclear Operators remain vital, alongside strategies to keep organizations’ talent engines running — and growing.

Proposed development, including a power plant and data center, has raised concerns about the area's future.

The basin provides critical habitats for endangered species, migratory birds, and thousands of sea turtles.

Lower South Carolina is home to one of the largest natural gems in the eastern United States, but with proposed plans for new development in the area many feel that it may be under attack.

Elsewhere in this edition and on our webpages you may read about proposals to build a new power plant, powered by more than 70 miles of natural gas pipeline, along with a massive new data center —and all of these projects are slated for the ACE Basin watershed area.

But what is the ACE Basin, and why is it so important?

Centered around the Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto rivers in Beaufort, Colleton and Charleston counties, between the coastal cities of Charleston and Beaufort, the 1.6-million-acre Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto (ACE) Basin watershed is one of the largest areas of undeveloped wetlands/uplands ecosystems remaining on the Atlantic Coast.

This remarkable interlocking web of ecosystems includes forested uplands and wetlands, extensive tidal marshes, managed wetlands, barrier islands and peatlands, states The Nature Conservancy, a global nonprofit conservation group that works to protect threatened habitats, lands and waters.

Once the home of numerous rice plantations, the area now provides important habitats for waterfowl, migratory birds and endangered species , as well as 33 types of natural plant communities.

The area is also home to three major natural reserves, including the ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), which is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources using funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

According to its S.C. Department of Natural Resources webpage, NERR's nearly 100,000 protected acres are home not only to wildlife, including shortnose sturgeon, loggerhead sea turtles, diamondback rattlesnakes and bald eagles, but also to cultural and archaeological resources.

NERR also serves as a community hub for coastal science and learning by organizations such as SCDNR and the Coastal Conservation League. The NERR educational programs include K-12 field trips, teacher workshops, and other educational resources, making the ACE Basin one of the largest outdoor classrooms in the country.

In addition to NERR, the ACE Basin is also home to the Botany Bay Plantation Heritage Preserve/Wildlife Management Area and The Ernest F. Hollings ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge.

Botany Bay Plantation Heritage Preserve/Wildlife Management Area is the yearly nesting site for approximately 50 to 100 sea turtles. The nests are protected from predators and as a result it is estimated that 3,000 to 10,000 sea turtles hatch on the island annually.

The Ernest F. Hollings ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge is a mosaic of lands and waters that harbors an abundance of migratory and resident birds, reptiles and amphibians, fish and other wildlife.

History of the ACE Basin

Provided by SCDNR

Humans have lived and utilized natural resources in the ACE Basin for thousands of years. The first human presence in the Basin occurred approximately 6,000 years ago with the Paleoindians. Like their Asian counterparts, Paleoindians are believed to have lived in mobile hunter-gatherer groups and hunted large animals such as mammoths and mastodons. New ways of hunting and gathering marked the end of the Paleoindian period and the beginning of the Archaic period and the modern-day Native Americans.

Until the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century, Paleoindian culture evolved into a more sedentary society that relied on hunting in smaller territories and agriculture. Semipermanent villages of several families were built near hunting grounds. Villagers tilled and planted crops such as corn, beans, and squash. During the summer months, the entire village moved to the homesteads near the coast, where they subsisted on seafood and wild plants, particularly roots.

Human activities have shaped the history, and the cultural and natural resources of the Basin. Early Carolinians cleared thousands of acres of old-growth hardwood forests and planted a variety of crops including corn, tobacco, and root crops. Tens of thousands of acres of bottomland hardwoods along the navigable rivers and creeks of the ACE Basin study area were converted to rice fields.

From the early 1700's to mid 1800's, much of the ACE Basin was home to large plantations owned by a small number of individuals who managed their wetlands primarily to grow rice using enslaved labor.

After the rice culture declined in the late 1800's, wealthy sportsmen purchased many of these plantations as hunting retreats. The new owners successfully managed the former rice fields and adjacent upland estates for a wide range of wildlife. Undeveloped and unpolluted, the habitat remains diverse and extremely productive.

Lumber companies of the late 1800s to early 1900s logged most of the virgin pine forests and swamplands in Colleton County and surrounding counties. Improvements in farming techniques, and the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway, roads, and railways were instrumental in promoting the development of the farming industry during the early twentieth century. Today, the extensive pine plantations and rice field systems established during this period are still evident.

The abandoned rice fields and logged forests attracted a rich abundance of game animals, including migratory waterfowl and deer to the area. The interest in hunting led to the evolution of sophisticated wildlife management techniques that help to preserve the natural quality of the ACE Basin study area that we enjoy today.

Most of the more well-known archaeological sites in the ACE Basin date from the recent historic period, particularly the 18th and 19th centuries when the area flourished as a prosperous agricultural region, and hundreds of sites have been formally recognized, with hundreds more likely still out there. Historians hope that the preservation of these cultural resources will sustain them for tourism and future generations.

The area is also the historical home to one of most important slave rescue operations of the Civil War.

According to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, on June 2, 1863, Harriet Tubman, under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, became the first woman to lead a major military operation in the United States when she and 150 African American Union soldiers rescued more than 700 slaves in the Combahee Ferry Raid.

Tubman, often referred to as “the Moses of her people,” was a former slave who fled to freedom in 1849. Tubman worked for years to bring enslaved women, men, and children from the south to the north through the Underground Railroad.

“The reason companies haven’t been using the global models is they’re not as easy to come by.
“When available tools neglect international sources of emissions, companies’ sustainability decisions suffer,” said study co-author Michael Steffen, Watershed’s head of climate analytics.
Corporations seeking to track and reduce emissions in their supply chains have the potential to make a meaningful difference in global carbon pollution, Davis said.
If those dollars are directed to the right places, it could meaningfully reduce global emissions,” he said.","A new Stanford-led analysis of corporate carbon disclosures finds companies undercount emissions from their supply chains by billions of tons.

The shortfall arises from use of a popular statistical model that assumes all suppliers are located in the United States. “Supply chains are global, though, so a model that assumes everything is made domestically is going to give us a wrong answer,” said Steve Davis, a professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the Dec. 20 study in Nature Communications.

Davis and co-authors set out to find out how far off estimates are under the common approach compared to results from an alternative model that considers emissions data from the regions where suppliers actually operate. They found the widely used single-region U.S. model, maintained until recently by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, missed about 2 billion tons, or 10% of emissions tied to more than 400 companies’ supply chains in 2023. That’s roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of Russia or India.

The additional 2023 emissions included approximately 973 million tons of emissions attributed to suppliers in China, which relies heavily on coal. The biggest gaps emerged in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as steel and concrete, construction machinery, fabricated metals used for cars and infrastructure, and electronic components.

Companies relying on estimates from single-region U.S. models may overlook the emissions impact of importing energy-intensive manufactured goods from China and Russia, according to the study. They may also miss opportunities to reduce emissions and associated costs by sourcing those goods from countries with cleaner grids, such as the U.S., France, and Brazil.

At the start of 2026, as an expanded carbon border tariff takes effect in Europe, the cost of upstream emissions is increasing for EU importers of manufactured goods, including steel, aluminum, and cement. “A company that’s interested in reducing the emissions in their supply chain needs to know not just how big the number is, but also where these emissions are coming from,” Davis said.

Expanding access to better data

Together with collaborators including lab member Wesley Ingwersen, who created the U.S. EPA model and led work on it until the agency shuttered it in August 2025, Davis is now working to make a global model freely available and easy to use through an effort called Cornerstone. “The reason companies haven’t been using the global models is they’re not as easy to come by. They are a lot more involved to build, and there hasn’t been an easy, open-source version,” said Davis.

The group is integrating the former government database with the multi-region model analyzed in the study, which was developed by a private company called Watershed, where Davis chairs the science advisory board and previously served as head of climate science.

“When available tools neglect international sources of emissions, companies’ sustainability decisions suffer,” said study co-author Michael Steffen, Watershed’s head of climate analytics.

The team aims to release the merged model in late 2026, with ambitions to account for emissions from land-use changes and deforestation in later research and iterations. “If you’re getting soybeans from Iowa, it has a very different footprint than if you’ve cut down some of the Amazon to grow those soybeans,” Davis said.

Scientists from the World Wildlife Fund and CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, co-authored the paper. “These are NGOs that are really interested in minimizing greenwashing and making sure that corporate climate actions are as beneficial as possible,” Davis said.

Some critics question whether models based on sector-wide averages and spending like those analyzed in the study are the right approach to estimate upstream emissions at all – regardless of whether global or single-region models are used. “I think we could all agree that if you had perfect data about exactly what was going on in your supply chain, you could make even more accurate estimates and leapfrog all of these models,” Davis said. “The reality is, though, that it’s still really difficult to get a lot of that data, and there’s little prospect of getting it without much more stringent regulations than are even on the table.” As a result, he said, there’s value in improving the modeling approach even if the long-term strategy is to get better data.

Corporations seeking to track and reduce emissions in their supply chains have the potential to make a meaningful difference in global carbon pollution, Davis said. “They are making sizable investments. If those dollars are directed to the right places, it could meaningfully reduce global emissions,” he said.",https://sustainability.stanford.edu/sites/sustainability/files/styles/large/public/media/image/gettyimages-539636438_0.jpg?itok=JOGemCqr,N,,2026-01-12 13:01:29.705337

This month’s update covers major congressional action on permitting reform and defense authorization, alongside significant developments in critical minerals investment, clean energy tax policy, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and federal energy regulation. From the House’s passage of the SPEED Act to FERC’s intervention on AI data center interconnections, these updates highlight how energy, national security, and technology policy will continue to converge in the new year, along with broader geopolitical events.

House Passes Permitting Reform Legislation

The House passed the SPEED Act, a sweeping overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by a 221-196 vote. Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill, while one Republican voted against it. During committee markup, Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) worked with lead Democratic co-sponsor Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) to add language making it harder for future presidents to revoke permits for energy projects of all types, an effort aimed at broadening Democratic support.

That compromise, however, sparked backlash from hardline Republicans, who argued the provision would “undermine” the Trump administration’s efforts to curb offshore wind development. To secure GOP votes, party leaders weakened the measure, prompting the American Clean Power Association and several Democrats to withdraw their support. Despite those defections, the bill ultimately cleared the House.

The changes may complicate negotiations with the Senate, though. Any broader bipartisan deal is likely to extend beyond NEPA to include reforms to the Clean Water Act to ease pipeline permitting — a key Republican priority — as well as provisions to facilitate interstate transmission development, which Democrats view as essential for bringing clean energy onto the nation’s power grid, but which House Republicans have so far resisted.

Further complicating the passage of the SPEED Act, and potentially killing any momentum for the foreseeable future, the White House halted construction of all US offshore wind projects three days before Christmas. While consistent with President Trump’s disdain for offshore wind, it will likely further erode Democratic and even some Republican support for the bill. It could also make Republicans vulnerable going into midterm elections in 2026, when electricity prices and general questions of electricity supply will likely be in focus.

NDAA Passes Congress

Both chambers of Congress passed the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing $901 billion for national security programs — $8 billion above the president’s budget request. The legislation includes several provisions with significant implications for energy, critical minerals, and industrial policy.

The Defense Industrial Base Fund is expanded to allow the Secretary of Defense to invest across defense supply chains, including materials, components, finished products, testing and qualification, infrastructure, facility construction and improvement, and equipment — explicitly encompassing critical minerals, materials, and chemicals. The bill also directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency, to expand recovery and reuse of strategic and critical materials under the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program.

In addition, the NDAA establishes an Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs to oversee a new Arctic Watcher Program, aimed at strengthening US energy security, cybersecurity, and economic interests in the Arctic, particularly in critical minerals and natural resources.

The bill updates covered technology categories for the Office of Strategic Capital to include nuclear fission and fusion energy technologies, extends the Defense Production Act through September 30, 2026, and reauthorizes the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) through 2031.

The DFC reauthorization significantly expands the agency’s authority, raising its investment cap to $205 billion — an increase of more than 300% — creating a $5 billion equity revolving fund, and allowing equity investments of up to 40% minority ownership. The legislation also expands geographic eligibility to all countries except the wealthiest 20, while maintaining limited investment authority in those countries through Five Eyes partnerships and select sectors, including energy, critical minerals and rare earths, and information and communications technology such as undersea cables. No more than 10% of the DFC’s maximum contingent liability may be used in wealthy or high-income countries.

Wind and Solar Tax Credit Lawsuit

A coalition of tribal, environmental, local, and consumer groups filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Trump administration rules that make it more difficult for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. The suit argues that new Treasury Department guidance unlawfully changes how the start of construction is determined for wind and solar facilities — eliminating the long-standing 5% safe harbor in favor of a stricter physical-work requirement — while leaving other technologies unaffected, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Led by the Oregon Environmental Council, the plaintiffs contend the rules unfairly discriminate against renewable energy, threaten investment and jobs in the wind and solar industries, and will reduce clean energy capacity, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. The lawsuit seeks to have the guidance declared arbitrary and capricious and vacated, as part of broader opposition to Trump administration efforts to roll back Biden-era clean energy policies.Treasury declined to comment on the litigation, and the IRS stated it does not comment on pending cases.

FERC Orders PJM to Revise AI Data Center Interconnection Rules

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, to develop new rules governing how loads, such as artificial intelligence data centers, connect to the electricity grid when they are co-located with power generators. FERC found PJM’s proposed co-location tariff to be “unjust and unreasonable,” citing a lack of clarity and consistency in rates, terms, and conditions for both generators serving co-located load and transmission customers.

The commission directed PJM to establish new transmission service options, with proposed terms expected early this year, and to submit a report by January 19, 2026 addressing reliability concerns associated with determining the amount of new capacity that is needed to maintain system reliability. The ruling is expected to influence FERC’s broader approach to the Department of Energy’s proposed rule to accelerate data center interconnections, which has drawn more than 160 public comments. With regard to the Department of Energy’s proposal, FERC Chair Laura Swett said FERC is actively reviewing the proposal and will move “as quickly as we can once we are ready.”

DOE Advances the Genesis Mission

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced agreements with 24 organizations to collaborate on the Genesis Mission to advance US artificial intelligence innovation, following responses to a recent request for information and ongoing project partnerships with DOE and the national laboratories. Participating organizations include major technology and AI leaders such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anthropic, Cerebras, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Oracle, Palantir, xAI, and XPRIZE, among others.

DOE also noted that two related RFIs remain open: “Partnerships for Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models” through January 14, 2026, and “Transformational AI Capabilities for National Security” through January 23, 2026.

Continued Critical Minerals Investments

The Trump administration is backing the construction of a $7.4 billion zinc smelter in Tennessee as part of a broader push to expand domestic critical minerals production through direct federal investment. Under the agreement, South Korea’s Korea Zinc will acquire the only operating primary zinc smelter in the United States and construct a new, modern facility capable of processing 13 different critical and strategic minerals beginning in 2029.

The project will be partially financed through a $1.9 billion joint venture involving investment from the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital. The deal follows South Korea’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States as part of trade negotiations aimed at avoiding higher US tariffs.

“All the things that we need to build transmission, distribution and power plants, they need to build data centers,” Frenzel said.","The growth of data centers can help reduce residential electricity rates, but power equipment supply chains remain stretched and there are labor shortages in specialized fields needed to build out the grid, Xcel Energy Chairman, President and CEO Bob Frenzel said Friday in a discussion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

“We’re at a major inflection point in the United States’ history, as it pertains to the next wave of important infrastructure,” Frenzel said. “That’s going to be artificial intelligence infrastructure.”

Xcel is headquartered in Minneapolis and serves power and gas customers across eight states: Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico and Texas. In October, the utility company raised its five-year capital spending plan to $60 billion, to include 7.5 GW of new renewable generation, 3 GW of new gas generation, 1.9 GW of energy storage, 1,500 miles of high-voltage transmission and $5 billion for wildfire mitigation.

New data center load represents about 60% of Xcel’s anticipated retail sales growth through 2030, officials said.

Frenzel sat down with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari to talk data centers, electricity prices, nuclear energy, labor markets and more. Here are five takeaways from their conversation.

Multiple demand growth drivers

The U.S. economy is “sending us mixed signals,” Kashkari said. “The labor market looks like it’s cooling gently. The stock market is doing well. There is a lot of investment in AI and data centers ... Are you optimistic on the economy?”

“I feel good about the parts of the economy that we touch and the ability to continue to help drive our customers’ businesses forward,” Frenzel said.

Like many utilities in the United States, Frenzel said Xcel has seen electric demand grow about 0.5% annually for the last 10 to 15 years, largely due to population growth with some offsets for energy efficiency.

“That model feels pretty good to us. The region, our customers who we talk to regularly, feel pretty good that underlying economic growth is probably about a half a percent a year,” he said.

Data centers and the oil and gas sector, however, have the potential to drive more rapid demand expansion, he said.

“What’s driving real growth is powering the current data centers that we serve, and the ones that are [coming]. That’s probably the Upper Midwest driver,” Frenzel said.

Another “huge piece of our business growth” is serving oil and gas activity in the Texas panhandle and southeastern New Mexico, “which is the heart of the Delaware and the Permian basins.”

Along with active drilling, “those producers continue to look for electrification and decarbonization of their own load. So instead of using diesel and natural gas powered rigs and compression, they’re using electric jack-up rigs and using electric pumps and motors and compression. So we’re seeing electric demand sort of two-fold down in the southwest region of our business as well,” Frenzel said.

Supply chains are degrading

Covid-19 gummed up supply chains around the world. Despite efforts to restore normal operations, “I just keep hearing about the long, long lead for anything electrical related,” Kashkari said.

Lead times for equipment procurement are “not getting better” and are “actually degrading,” Frenzel replied.

“We used to be able to get a transformer in a year. Now it’s closer to three years,” he said.

Combustion turbine gas plant construction used to take 18 months and now run 4 to 5 years, he added.

“We need to look forward more and plan more, and we need to build the infrastructure that’s needed further in advance,” Frenzel said. “That takes an enormous amount of thoughtfulness on our side, and partnership on the side of our regulators and our other stakeholders.”

Supply chain delays are “causing us to have to behave differently and, in partnership with our other stakeholders, to really be proactive,” he said.

Alternative rate structures protect customers

Investment in data centers “seems to be the big bright spot on the U.S. economy,” Kashkari said, with tariffs and trade uncertainty putting a damper on some areas. “There’s a lot of concern that, hey, is AI a bubble? ... How do you think about that?”

Xcel is in “daily conversation” with the largest hyperscale data center developers, Frenzel said.

“If we overbuild, that means that the people overpay,” he said. To counter the threat to other ratepayers, the utility is looking at alternative types of rate arrangements.

“We’re trying to find long-term pricing arrangements with the Metas, the Googles, the Amazons of the world,” Frenzel said. “Think 15-20 year contracts. Minimum revenue requirements, or minimum floor takes, in terms of contract pricing. So that we can make sure that we build infrastructure to support them, that infrastructure is amortized over the life of that contract, and we protect our existing customer base.”

If data centers are managed correctly, the new load should help put downward pressure on rates, Frenzel said. The grid is a fixed asset and so increased data center demand, “all things being equal,” should help to offset economic price pressures.

Xcel CEO an ‘unabashed nuclear fan’

Nuclear energy is the “preferred source of energy for data centers,” Frenzel said.

The U.S. has about 100 reactors that provide about 50% of the country’s carbon free electricity, he said. A major power sector question is whether to pivot to other sources or redouble investment in nuclear.

“Our nuclear fleet in this country is probably close to 40 years old ... Are we going to revitalize that as a core energy source for the United States? I think we should. I think it should be a national imperative. I think it should be a national initiative,” said Frenzel, a former nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy.

But that will also require that U.S. industrial policy ensure development of a domestic fuel supply chain, he noted, pointing to the U.S. Department of Energy’s commitment of $2.7 billion to strengthen enrichment services over the next 10 years.

“We need the actual supply chain here. We need the skilled labor here,” Frenzel said. “It has to be an all-parts-of -government and all-parts-of-industry effort to bring a national nuclear renaissance forward.”

Data center development spikes engineering, procurement and construction costs

The unemployment rate ticked down last week, Kashkari noted. “Nationally, it seems to be a low hiring, low firing environment,” he said. “What [is Xcel] experiencing as you continue to build out your infrastructure?”

Labor markets are relatively neutral, Frenzel said, though “pockets are really getting more and more challenging.”

Data center developers have announced new construction plans totaling about $600 billion in capital spending, Frenzel said. While some of that is for computing infrastructure such as chips, it also creates competition for engineering, concrete, steel, cabling, controls, pumps, valves and HVAC.

“All the things that we need to build transmission, distribution and power plants, they need to build data centers,” Frenzel said. “And so where we’re seeing pressure in the labor markets: engineers, linemen, electricians, plumbing, pipe fitting, concrete, groundwork, civil work. All of that stuff has been a labor market push from our perspective.”

“When I look at what we’re paying for engineering and procurement and construction partners ... we’re seeing real pricing pressure, probably 30% to 40% over the last year or two, in terms of EPC rates for new construction,” he added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XczUS41OGE01aLBbtRg2bRVjLDzj8AwqYKe61-SpKNo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9YY2VsY29udm8ucG5n.webp,N,,2026-01-12 14:16:03.872119

Argent LNG says its “Louisiana First” approach prioritizes local hiring and local manufacturing partnerships.
Argent’s project received support last week in a vote in the Louisiana Senate, according to a report in LNG Industry.
The resolution, which passed in 36-3 vote, was introduced by state Sen. Michael Fesi, a Republican representing Louisiana’s District 20, which includes the Port Fourchon area.
Port Fourchon is the base of operations for over 250 companies which currently service over 95% of the Gulf of America’s deepwater energy production.","Federal regulators have begun a study of the environmental effects of a large-scale LNG export facility proposed by Louisiana-based Argent LNG for a site about 100 miles south of New Orleans at the Port of Fourchon, one of the world’s most active energy shipping hubs, a recent government filing shows.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission formally requested public comments on the scope of issues that should be addressed in the environmental document, the filing shows.

Metairie-based Argent, which wants to build a liquefaction plant with annual capacity of 25 million tons per year on a 900-acre site on Bayou Lafourche, would be the first homegrown company operating in Louisiana’s rapidly expanding LNG export industry. Jonathan Bass, a native Louisianan, is the company’s founder, chairperson and CEO.

The five large-scale LNG exporters now building plants in Louisiana, all owned by out-of-state companies, will add about 75 million tons of capacity over the next five years, according to industry analysts. The LNG exporters building the plants are based in Houston, Arlington, Virginia and Australia.

Argent LNG says its “Louisiana First” approach prioritizes local hiring and local manufacturing partnerships. The company prioritizes the use of local contractors and suppliers and keeping investments in the regional economy, citing its partnership with Grand Isle Shipyard, a firm based in Galliano, Louisiana.

Argent’s project received support last week in a vote in the Louisiana Senate, according to a report in LNG Industry. The resolution, which passed in 36-3 vote, was introduced by state Sen. Michael Fesi, a Republican representing Louisiana’s District 20, which includes the Port Fourchon area.

“This resolution sends a clear message: Louisiana is open for business and fostering world-class energy investment, built by Louisiana workers, with American technology, and for the benefit of our allies,” Fesi said in a statement.

“Port Fourchon is uniquely positioned to host a project that will define our state’s energy future for generations, while leaning in to support the President’s Energy Dominance Council in supplying countries of shared values with base-load energy to develop sustainable energy solutions. Louisiana will lead the world in delivering affordable energy to provide opportunity to citizens around the globe who align with US principles,” said Fesi.

Last July, the Greater Lafourche Port Commission acquired a 743-acre tract from the state to add to an existing 150-acre site, with the purchase specifically intended to provide Argent with the space needed to build a large-scale LNG facility.

Argent LNG hosted a community open house in early December at the Greater Lafourche Port Commission office, attended by 200 local government officials and community members, reported The National Law Review.

Australia and several other countries are joining a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies in Washington on Monday on the subject, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said over the weekend.

Most of the G7, which includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada - with the European Union also taking part - are heavily dependent on rare earths supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Australia, among the world's leading producers of critical minerals, has been developing a strategic reserve to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities which it plans to make available to allies.

""The world needs critical minerals - Australia has plenty of them and our critical minerals reserve will help us weather global economic uncertainty and help to boost trade and investment,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement.

The first minerals in focus are crucial for clean energy and high-technology manufacturing as well as advanced military equipment, the treasurer's office said.

""The Reserve will operate by securing rights to minerals produced in Australia and on-selling those rights to meet demand, giving an added boost to Australia’s critical minerals sector and strengthening reliable supply chains for our trading partners,"" it said.

Australia plans to introduce legislation that will expand the powers of its export finance agency (EFA) and the department of industry, which will oversee reserve-related transactions, Minister for Resources Madeleine King told a press briefing in Perth.

The reserve, originally targeted for launch by mid-2026, will be operational by year-end, King said.

The EFA will enable offtake agreements with fixed or floating prices trading in forward contracts, she said, which are those set for future delivery of physical supply.

It will also manage offtake agreements and intermediary demand and supply aggregation, as well as stockpiling and contracts for difference, King said.

Contracts for difference are a tool that helps manage price risk from when a contract begins, to when it is delivered.

Australia signed an agreement with the U.S. in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals that are vulnerable to disruption.

On January 9, Meta said it has reached agreements that could support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and extended nuclear generation by 2035, spanning existing plants, capacity uprates, and advanced reactor development. The projects are intended to supply power into regional grids that support Meta’s operations, including its AI infrastructure in Ohio.

Unlike renewable power purchase agreements that primarily address emissions goals, these deals emphasize reliability and capacity certainty—a growing concern as AI workloads drive continuous, high-load electricity demand.

Preserving and Expanding Existing Nuclear Capacity

A central element of Meta’s strategy involves extending the life and output of operating nuclear plants in the PJM Interconnection region, one of the most capacity-constrained power markets in the U.S.

Through agreements with Vistra, Meta is supporting continued operations and uprates at three nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The uprates, totaling 433 megawatts, are expected to come online in the early 2030s and would increase firm generation without the long timelines associated with new construction.

For grid planners and facilities leaders, such uprates can be particularly valuable, as they deliver incremental capacity faster than new builds while reinforcing regional reliability.

Betting on Advanced Nuclear for the 2030s

Meta is also backing next-generation nuclear through agreements with TerraPower and Oklo.

The TerraPower agreement supports development of up to eight Natrium® reactor units, representing 2.8 GW of baseload power with integrated energy storage, targeted for deployment beginning in the early 2030s. Oklo’s planned advanced nuclear campus in Ohio could add up to 1.2 GW of new baseload capacity to the PJM market as early as 2030.

While these projects remain long-dated, the agreements provide developers with financial certainty and signal how large energy users are planning years ahead of load growth.

More From Our Experts

Affordable, accessible energy underpins U.S. security and prosperity. Federally funded energy innovations, from the invention of nuclear power to the development of shale gas, have created many opportunities to advance those goals. Such advances can mitigate ever-evolving threats as well, including climate change, which is damaging societies and ecosystems worldwide and will worsen in the years to come. New technologies that are cheaper and cleaner than those that predominate today are creating markets that will be worth trillions of dollars. China has seized this opportunity aggressively, taking commanding positions in rapidly growing industries like solar power and lithium-ion batteries.

Energy and Climate Policy

President Donald Trump has dismissed climate science. But many of his priorities for energy policy, including meeting the insatiable demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, making energy more affordable for average Americans, and catalyzing a renaissance in nuclear power, as well as responding to a rising China, would be advanced considerably by sustaining federal innovation investments. Instead, the incoming administration proposed [PDF] massive, across-the-board cuts in the Department of Energy’s FY26 R&D budget. (See Table 1.) It also sought to pull back billions of dollars for large-scale, first-of-a-kind demonstration projects that were funded with bipartisan support in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

In the bipartisan, bicameral package released last week, Congress took a more reasonable approach. It reduced the total cut in federal energy R&D spending to just 2.6 percent, compared to 32.5 percent proposed by the president. It transferred a small portion of unexpended infrastructure funding to annual appropriations. This accounting maneuver allows budget hawks to claim a minor victory while preserving the bulk of energy infrastructure funding for future investment, rather than returning it to the treasury. Nuclear energy R&D (increased 23.5 percent), not surprisingly, did much better than energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D (reduced 11.3 percent) in the final bill. (The main demonstration program for nuclear power, which is not included in these figures, will also receive a bump in FY26.) Such incremental adjustments are consistent with historic shifts in partisan control of the federal government, not a radical break from the past.

The budget outcome echoes that of OB3. That massive tax and spending bill [PDF] cut incentives to deploy mature energy technologies, notably solar and wind, but it retained or expanded them for many emerging low-carbon energy technologies, including geothermal, nuclear, carbon capture, and advanced energy storage. OB3 passed with only Republican votes, yet many of the policies it reaffirmed had previously been included in bills passed by Democrats in the prior Congress.

More From Our Experts

The bipartisan compromise expressed in the FY26 budget and OB3 is far from ideal. A recent report [PDF] from Clean Tomorrow calls for a sustained expansion and significant realignment of federal investment in energy R&D to meet the Chinese challenge to U.S. leadership. Nonetheless, by refusing to cede control of energy innovation policy to hardcore budget cutters in the executive branch, Congress has preserved key foundations that would allow such growth to resume in the future, such as national lab and academic infrastructure, science and engineering students and faculty, clean energy start-ups, and corporate research labs.

The next step for Congress will be to ensure that the Trump administration executes its policy in good faith. Oversight and accountability should be the watchwords, particularly in light of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought’s refusal to acknowledge legislative primacy in matters of taxing and spending. Congress’s reassertion needs to have practical, not merely rhetorical, effect if U.S. energy innovation policy is to fulfill its potential.

The company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp finalised a series of landmark agreements on 9 January, all of which amount to the offtake of 6.6GW of nuclear power by 2035.

Mark Zuckerberg's firm signed 20-year power purchase deals with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo for undisclosed sums, following on from its previous agreement with Constellation Energy. The move places it alongside firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft in terms of the procurement of nuclear energy.

This announcement is proof positive that the US's foremost technology companies are increasingly turning to nuclear as a solution for the spiralling energy demands of AI infrastructure.

Extending operational life of existing plants

The Vistra partnership represents the most immediate impact on America's nuclear fleet.

Meta will purchase more than 2.1GW of energy through 20-year agreements covering two Ohio plants – Perry and Davis-Besse – along with capacity expansions at these facilities and a third site at Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania.

The uprates will add 433MW of new capacity to the PJM grid region in the early 2030s.

""This agreement is beneficial in many ways – it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located,"" says Jim Burke, who is President and CEO of Vistra.

All three facilities feed into the PJM interconnection, the regional transmission organisation that coordinates electricity across 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Backing next-generation reactor designs

Meta's agreements with TerraPower and Oklo are slightly different in that they target those more advanced nuclear technologies that remain unproven at commercial scales.

The TerraPower deal provides funding for two Natrium units capable of generating up to 690MW, with delivery anticipated as early as 2032.

Meta has also secured rights to energy from six additional Natrium units producing 2.1GW, targeted for 2035 delivery.

The eight potential units would provide 2.8GW of baseload generation capacity plus 1.2GW of built-in storage.

""This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,"" explains Chris Levesque, TerraPower's President and CEO.

Chris noted that the company has completed its design, established supply chains and cleared key regulatory milestones for its first Natrium plant currently under development.

Ohio campus could deliver 1.2GW

The Oklo partnership focuses on Pike County, Ohio, where an advanced nuclear technology campus could come online as early as 2030.

The project aims to add up to 1.2GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market.

Multiple Aurora Powerhouse reactors would be constructed on the site, with Oklo's designs based on fast-reactor technology capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

""Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,"" says Jacob DeWitte, Oklo's co-Founder and CEO.

The projects collectively promise thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent operational positions across Ohio and Pennsylvania.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c7f20c6b8b918cd72e60fc149f69ba43:bd3a5a8cd7716a8c293c8f3646acb3f3/02-oklo-carousel-02.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:13:32.728864

This month’s update covers major congressional action on permitting reform and defense authorization, alongside significant developments in critical minerals investment, clean energy tax policy, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and federal energy regulation. From the House’s passage of the SPEED Act to FERC’s intervention on AI data center interconnections, these updates highlight how energy, national security, and technology policy will continue to converge in the new year, along with broader geopolitical events.

House Passes Permitting Reform Legislation

The House passed the SPEED Act, a sweeping overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by a 221-196 vote. Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill, while one Republican voted against it. During committee markup, Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) worked with lead Democratic co-sponsor Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) to add language making it harder for future presidents to revoke permits for energy projects of all types, an effort aimed at broadening Democratic support.

That compromise, however, sparked backlash from hardline Republicans, who argued the provision would “undermine” the Trump administration’s efforts to curb offshore wind development. To secure GOP votes, party leaders weakened the measure, prompting the American Clean Power Association and several Democrats to withdraw their support. Despite those defections, the bill ultimately cleared the House.

The changes may complicate negotiations with the Senate, though. Any broader bipartisan deal is likely to extend beyond NEPA to include reforms to the Clean Water Act to ease pipeline permitting — a key Republican priority — as well as provisions to facilitate interstate transmission development, which Democrats view as essential for bringing clean energy onto the nation’s power grid, but which House Republicans have so far resisted.

Further complicating the passage of the SPEED Act, and potentially killing any momentum for the foreseeable future, the White House halted construction of all US offshore wind projects three days before Christmas. While consistent with President Trump’s disdain for offshore wind, it will likely further erode Democratic and even some Republican support for the bill. It could also make Republicans vulnerable going into midterm elections in 2026, when electricity prices and general questions of electricity supply will likely be in focus.

NDAA Passes Congress

Both chambers of Congress passed the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing $901 billion for national security programs — $8 billion above the president’s budget request. The legislation includes several provisions with significant implications for energy, critical minerals, and industrial policy.

The Defense Industrial Base Fund is expanded to allow the Secretary of Defense to invest across defense supply chains, including materials, components, finished products, testing and qualification, infrastructure, facility construction and improvement, and equipment — explicitly encompassing critical minerals, materials, and chemicals. The bill also directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency, to expand recovery and reuse of strategic and critical materials under the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program.

In addition, the NDAA establishes an Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs to oversee a new Arctic Watcher Program, aimed at strengthening US energy security, cybersecurity, and economic interests in the Arctic, particularly in critical minerals and natural resources.

The bill updates covered technology categories for the Office of Strategic Capital to include nuclear fission and fusion energy technologies, extends the Defense Production Act through September 30, 2026, and reauthorizes the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) through 2031.

The DFC reauthorization significantly expands the agency’s authority, raising its investment cap to $205 billion — an increase of more than 300% — creating a $5 billion equity revolving fund, and allowing equity investments of up to 40% minority ownership. The legislation also expands geographic eligibility to all countries except the wealthiest 20, while maintaining limited investment authority in those countries through Five Eyes partnerships and select sectors, including energy, critical minerals and rare earths, and information and communications technology such as undersea cables. No more than 10% of the DFC’s maximum contingent liability may be used in wealthy or high-income countries.

Wind and Solar Tax Credit Lawsuit

A coalition of tribal, environmental, local, and consumer groups filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Trump administration rules that make it more difficult for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. The suit argues that new Treasury Department guidance unlawfully changes how the start of construction is determined for wind and solar facilities — eliminating the long-standing 5% safe harbor in favor of a stricter physical-work requirement — while leaving other technologies unaffected, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Led by the Oregon Environmental Council, the plaintiffs contend the rules unfairly discriminate against renewable energy, threaten investment and jobs in the wind and solar industries, and will reduce clean energy capacity, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. The lawsuit seeks to have the guidance declared arbitrary and capricious and vacated, as part of broader opposition to Trump administration efforts to roll back Biden-era clean energy policies.Treasury declined to comment on the litigation, and the IRS stated it does not comment on pending cases.

FERC Orders PJM to Revise AI Data Center Interconnection Rules

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, to develop new rules governing how loads, such as artificial intelligence data centers, connect to the electricity grid when they are co-located with power generators. FERC found PJM’s proposed co-location tariff to be “unjust and unreasonable,” citing a lack of clarity and consistency in rates, terms, and conditions for both generators serving co-located load and transmission customers.

The commission directed PJM to establish new transmission service options, with proposed terms expected early this year, and to submit a report by January 19, 2026 addressing reliability concerns associated with determining the amount of new capacity that is needed to maintain system reliability. The ruling is expected to influence FERC’s broader approach to the Department of Energy’s proposed rule to accelerate data center interconnections, which has drawn more than 160 public comments. With regard to the Department of Energy’s proposal, FERC Chair Laura Swett said FERC is actively reviewing the proposal and will move “as quickly as we can once we are ready.”

DOE Advances the Genesis Mission

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced agreements with 24 organizations to collaborate on the Genesis Mission to advance US artificial intelligence innovation, following responses to a recent request for information and ongoing project partnerships with DOE and the national laboratories. Participating organizations include major technology and AI leaders such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anthropic, Cerebras, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Oracle, Palantir, xAI, and XPRIZE, among others.

DOE also noted that two related RFIs remain open: “Partnerships for Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models” through January 14, 2026, and “Transformational AI Capabilities for National Security” through January 23, 2026.

Continued Critical Minerals Investments

The Trump administration is backing the construction of a $7.4 billion zinc smelter in Tennessee as part of a broader push to expand domestic critical minerals production through direct federal investment. Under the agreement, South Korea’s Korea Zinc will acquire the only operating primary zinc smelter in the United States and construct a new, modern facility capable of processing 13 different critical and strategic minerals beginning in 2029.

The project will be partially financed through a $1.9 billion joint venture involving investment from the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital. The deal follows South Korea’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States as part of trade negotiations aimed at avoiding higher US tariffs.

Houston is the only major city in Texas without a solid waste fee.
In addition to improving waste services, a solid waste fee incentives citizens to reduce waste production and utilize reusable items in their everyday lives.
PAYT is a type of solid waste fee that works like a utility bill.","Houston’s solid waste system is broken. In 2025, over 85,000 complaints have gone to 311 for missed trash, heavy trash, and recycling pickups. Missed pickups are ranked as one of the top five service requests to 311. Our recycling rate is estimated to be just 16%. That is 16 percentage points below the national average of 32%. And every year, millions of tons of waste, including single-use plastics, end up in landfills or as litter in our bayous and parks.

One major reason? Houston spends only about half as much per household on waste services as cities like Dallas and San Antonio. That translates to lack of manpower and lack of equipment to address waste pickup and processing, which is a problem Houston has notably had for years.

We need more staff, more pickup trucks, more transfer stations, and more public education campaigns on recycling to meet the needs of Houstonians and achieve our zero waste goals. While we applaud the efforts of the current city administration to improve services by temporarily employing contractors for garbage pickup and increasing the amount of pickup trucks for solid waste collection, these efforts are not enough to fully address Houston’s trash problem.

By adopting a solid waste fee, Houston can finally invest in proven solutions–reliable curbside collection, stronger recycling programs, composting, and waste reduction initiatives. Houston is the only major city in Texas without a solid waste fee. Council Member Sallie Alcorn’s “Your Two Cents” survey, in collaboration with Rice University, found that around two-thirds of respondents would support an increase in taxes or fees to better fund essential city services, and about two-thirds would specifically pay some type of garbage fee. With those investments, we can cut pollution, clean up our streets and bayous, and get Houston back on track to meet its zero waste goals.

In addition to improving waste services, a solid waste fee incentives citizens to reduce waste production and utilize reusable items in their everyday lives. Cities have reported an average trash reduction of 28% after implementing a “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT) fee. PAYT is a type of solid waste fee that works like a utility bill. The more you throw, the more you pay, and the less you throw, the less you pay.

We want to fix Houston’s solid waste system, not break it further, which is why we are also calling an end to “chemical recycling.” Houston partnered with petrochemical companies to promote this so-called chemical recycling. But let’s be clear—that’s not real recycling. These facilities burn plastics, pump more pollution into our air, and keep us locked into dependence on single-use plastics. 2025 has proven that chemical recycling is a failing industry as facilities are continuously closed down due to lack of return, yet there are still attempts to expand on these unstable economic projects. Houstonians deserve better.

That’s why we’re bringing Houstonians together to demand that our city invest in the waste and recycling system we deserve. Included below are some highlights.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_610569836-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:00:35.595729

U.S. SENATE News:

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, delivered remarks on the Senate floor on how the Trump administration’s actions to cancel and stall energy projects are killing jobs, skyrocketing electric bills, and threatening permitting reform.

The speech comes as Donald Trump has suspended every permit for offshore wind projects and stalled the permits of more than 500 clean energy projects – exacerbating our nation’s energy affordability crisis.

“Any permitting deal is going to have to guarantee that no Administration of either party can weaponize the permitting process for cheap political points. By raising electricity prices and killing American jobs, this Administration has made it crystal clear that they are not interested in permitting reform, or bringing down the price of energy,” said Ranking Member Heinrich. “The bottom line is this: The Trump Administration needs to follow the law, they need to reverse their illegal stop work orders, and they need to start approving legally compliant energy projects. Full stop.”

Expanding E15 access is one of the most immediate and practical ways to address this imbalance. When fully scaled, year-round, nationwide E15 is poised to create new domestic demand for billions of bushels of corn and sorghum, help stabilize markets, support farmers, and deliver consumer savings at the pump.”

The letter was led by Growth Energy, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association.

In recent years, the organizations noted, E15 availability during the summer driving season has depended on temporary emergency waivers. While these annual actions provide short-term relief, they are not a sustainable or reliable solution.

Year-to-year uncertainty discourages investment in fuel infrastructure, confuses consumers and undermines confidence among retailers and refiners.

A recent study found that nationwide, year-round E15 sales would add up to $25.8 billion to the U.S. GDP, generate up to $10.3 billion in household income and support more than 128,000 new full-time jobs across the country.

“With a record corn crop filling bins across America, farmers cannot afford another season of uncertainty and negative margins,” the groups wrote. “Markets need consistency and predictability, which requires permanent legislative action by Congress. We respectfully urge you to act this year to pass year-round E15 legislation.”

The groups said year-round E15 legislation would ensure the record corn and sorghum crop finds a stable domestic market and would provide consistent access to lower-priced E15 fuel for consumers nationwide. This legislation would remove an outdated regulatory barrier and deliver economic growth across rural America, while also strengthening America’s energy security and reducing emissions, the groups said.

Grab your red fedora and trench coat, because The Morning Dump is a global affair today. From the hallowed halls of Congress, I’ll whisk you off to the hippy hills of California, where the state is hoping to keep its EV dreams alive.

I’ll then take you south of the border, down Mexico way, where Volkswagen is claiming the United States isn’t holding up its end of the USMCA. And, finally, it’s off to Europe, where China and the EU seem to have come to terms on what to do about the sudden influx of cheap cars to the continent.

Rockapella voice: Where in the world is… The Morning Dump?

It’ll Get Interesting For Used EV Buyers In 3-4 Months

Back in 2022, then-President Biden and then-WV Senator Joe Manchin managed to sneak the Inflation Reduction Act through a Congressional backdoor. Did it meaningfully reduce inflation as the name promised? Not in any obvious way. Did it dramatically increase inflation as some warned? No, not that either. It’s just a political name to describe something that had way more to do with creating green jobs and incentivizing EV production and purchases than with inflation.

Most, though not all, of the Inflation Reduction Act was Uno-Reverso’d by the One Big Beautiful Bill, including the provision that provided $7,500 off for the purchase of specific electric cars. Because America’s European and Asian allies freaked out a little bit about this (this was back when the White House cared about having European and Asian allies), the Biden White House carved out an exemption big enough to drive a Kia EV9 through.

Specifically, the law said the $7,500 could apply to any commercial vehicle, whatever the country of origin. The IRS interpreted a lease as a commercial vehicle. Senator Manchin freaked out about this, but ultimately, the lease exemption stayed.

As you can see in the chart above, anything that’s orange is a leased vehicle. I wrote about this before, but for most automakers, leasing was how they moved electric cars. Most leases are 24 or 36 months, which means that there’s going to be a point where all of these leased electric cars are going to get returned. Courtesy of the Q4 Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index Call presentation, you can see exactly when that’s going to start:

Those green vehicles are leases being returned, and the dark blue ones are PHEVs. As you can see, starting in approximately April of this year, the market is going to start getting flooded with potentially up to 40-50k used EVs every month.

Granted, many people could buy out their leases, but I think this is probably not a great idea for most lesees. As outlined before, our advice has always been to lease a new EV or buy a used one. The argument to lease has mostly gone away, but the idea of buying a used one still makes a lot of sense.

It’ll be a case-by-case basis, but for it to make sense for someone to buy out their electric car lease, a consumer will have to love the car and have either previously negotiated a buy-out price that reflects the significant depreciation that’s occurred, or be able to negotiate that again. I suspect that as more, say, used e-trons and Polestars get dumped on the market, used car values will drop further.

There are potential counterweights here. The lack of affordability in the market and the likely increase in electric car costs might balance it out a bit. Overall, this represents a great opportunity for someone to get a potentially good used EV at a great price. I suspect a lot of these vehicles will be CPO as well, which brings some peace of mind.

As an example, here’s a Hyundai Ioniq 6 with just 16,000 miles for just over $25,000 with tons of warranty left and even more on the battery/motor. I’d keep an eye on vehicles like the Ioniq 6, the MachE, et cetera. Also, this isn’t going anywhere. It may start in April, but it’ll continue on for the next 24-36 months.

The one caveat here is that I would check to see if the vehicle was used as rideshare car, as these tend to get charged up to 100% more frequently in my experience and may have a lower battery life. (Though modern batteries seem to be holding up well).

Will California Give You A Discount On A Used EV?

California has pledged to continue its own statewide EV tax rebate plan, setting aside $200 million for on-the-hood discounts. It’s not clear how long it’ll last, and it’s not clear if that’ll also work for used EVs purchased at a dealership.

USA Today has a little more:

California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Lauren Sanchez said in an exclusive interview with USA Today that her state is stepping up to offer EV tax credits because “the rest of the global market is moving toward” Zero Emission Vehicles, despite the backsliding in the level of federal support under Trump.

Sanchez said embracing EVs is “point of pride in California” because “a third of EV sales are in California.”

Under California’s previous EV tax credit program, which ran from 2013-2024, the state spent $1.49 billion to cover credits for 586,000 vehicles, according to CARB.

Asked specifically about used EVs, Sanchez told USA Today that “The team is taking a hard look at how we can [sic] a used incentive work.”

Fingers crossed for folks in the EV market.

Volkswagen: This Isn’t Fair

This is hard to quantify, but the sense that I get from most automaker execs–whatever their own personal politics–is that they don’t want to upset the President while also avoiding seeming political in a way that might upset people who disagree with the administration. It’s not worth it. Tesla’s CEO being so obviously political is likely to cost Tesla hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars.

One of the big sticking points between automakers who sell cars in the United States and the White House is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This was a modification to NAFTA, and it continued the idea of a trade zone between the three countries. It was also a major policy of President Trump in his first term. President Trump doesn’t like the deal anymore and has clearly tried to discourage continued production in these countries, and most automakers have adjusted by trying to announce big projects in the United States while trying to take advantage of some transitional offsets.

Volkswagen is not one of those automakers. It has a huge footprint in Mexico and is saying the quiet part out loud as the Associated Press reports:

Though some in the auto industry have privately suggested that Trump’s tariffs amount to violations, companies have been hesitant to issue public positions saying so. Instead, they have mostly stuck to questioning the merits of Trump’s actions while also offering constructive recommendations on how U.S. trade policy should proceed.

That trend largely continued in a series of letters filed this week by automakers, suppliers and trade groups regarding the USMCA’s automotive rules of origin provisions. The Trump administration previously solicited broader comments on the trade deal in November, but the latest request for comments was for autos only.

Volkswagen, amid falling U.S. sales, was more critical of the Trump administration than industry competitors in its public filing. Europe’s largest automaker pleaded for tariff relief and requested that existing USMCA rules not be made stricter after the review.

I don’t know that this means that VW is exactly joining the Resistance alongside the Fed Chair and, uh, Wine Moms, but it’s a notable difference from most carmakers.

China And The EU Are Friends Again, Sort Of

As anyone who reads TMD regularly knows, Chinese automakers created a huge production capacity for EVs. There aren’t enough consumers in China to absorb all that demand, so it’s been trying to export cars. This is good for markets where no one makes cars, as those folks get cheap EVs. Everyone else? Not so much, so the EU slapped high tariffs on Chinese importers.

The Chinese government got mad and threatened to make French wine and other random things expensive. Now, according to the European Union, there’s a plan that should make everyone happy enough.

In its “Guidance document on submission of price undertaking offers” document, the EU offers up a plan whereby automakers will set a reasonable “Minimum Import Price” (MIP) that will counter the impact of subsidization. How will this be determined?

Based on the CIF prices of the exporter in question in the investigation period of the proceeding leading to the imposition of the measures, increased by the relevant margin of the countervailing duties imposed.

Basing the MIP on the non-subsidised EU-produced BEV’s sales price in the Union of the same product type (or closely resembling, appropriately adjusted for physical differences), which includes Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A) and a reasonable margin of profit.

It’s complicated. For the moment, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU seems cool with it:

The China Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (CCCEU) warmly welcomes and highly commends the positive outcome achieved through dialogue and consultations between China and the European Union, which has enabled a soft landing in the electric vehicle case. This important result responds directly to strong concerns from the business community, including the automotive sector. It not only supports the healthy and stable development of China–EU trade, investment, and bilateral relations, but also sends a clear and strong signal to global markets that both sides remain firmly committed to managing differences through dialogue and consultation, and to jointly upholding a rules-based multilateral trading system and an open global economy.

Given all of the above involving the United States and its trade position, expect China to continue to fill the EV demand left by the United States in various places around the world.

The Big Question

Is there a used EV you’d consider? How cheap would it have to be?

Energy is the backbone of our economy and our way of life. From powering homes to fueling businesses, reliable and affordable energy keeps America moving forward. But today, outdated permitting rules are blocking the very projects we need to secure our future. Regulations that were designed to provide a fair process have turned into roadblocks. Instead of delivering better outcomes, they now drive up costs, stall job creation, and leave families footing the bill.

On average, major energy projects take more than six years to secure approval. Some transmission lines have been delayed as long as seventeen years. During that time, demand keeps rising, infrastructure keeps aging, and costs keep climbing. Transmission congestion alone cost American families $11.5 billion in 2023. Those costs show up in monthly utility bills and in lost opportunities for new jobs and investment.

Every state feels these challenges. In the Southeast, families have watched their power bills surge nearly 24 percent for households and 19 percent across all sectors in just the past decade. Families and businesses are paying more, while projects that could deliver cleaner, cheaper power are stuck in line. The result is a system where energy consumers pay the price of government inaction.

***

Permitting delays no longer make projects safer or cleaner. They simply make them more expensive and less certain. Developers spend years navigating duplicative reviews and endless litigation, often without a clear end in sight. This uncertainty discourages investment, slows innovation, and means fewer new projects break ground. At the same time, consumers lose out on the lower costs and greater reliability that come when competition and new supply are allowed to flourish.

The stakes are only getting higher. America’s energy demand is growing rapidly. Expanding industries like data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electric vehicles are adding new load to an already strained grid. Without timely upgrades to transmission and generation, costs will rise, reliability will suffer, and our ability to compete globally will weaken. We can’t afford to let red tape hold us back.

That’s why permitting reform is essential. A smarter, more predictable system would:

Set clear timelines so reviews can’t drag on for years without resolution.

Reduce duplication by designating a single lead agency to oversee major projects.

Focus reviews on major projects while letting routine, low-impact ones move quickly.

Prevent endless lawsuits by establishing fair but limited opportunities for judicial review.

These reforms won’t weaken environmental protections. They’ll simply make the process work. Americans deserve both strong environmental stewardship and an energy system that is affordable, reliable, and secure. With clearer rules and faster decisions, we can have both.

Permitting reform is about more than paperwork. It’s about lowering costs for families. It’s about creating jobs through new projects and infrastructure. And it’s about strengthening America’s energy independence so we’re never at the mercy of foreign supply chains or aging infrastructure.

We’ve always been a nation that builds. From railroads to highways to pipelines, our infrastructure has powered our growth and secured our future. But today, the greatest obstacle to building isn’t technology or resources, it’s bureaucracy. Red tape is holding America back at the exact moment when we need to unleash our full energy potential.

By cutting through the gridlock and modernizing our permitting system, Congress can deliver real results: affordable electricity, reliable power, secure supply, and new jobs. Families want it, businesses need it, and our future depends on it.

Permitting reform is not just a policy debate, it’s a national necessity. The time to act is now. Let’s fix permitting, unleash American energy, and secure a stronger future for every state.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), that would have voided an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule issued in August that approved South Dakota’s revision of its plan for implementing the EPA’s rule governing regional haze levels and visibility at national parks such as Mount Rushmore. Whitehouse said the approval was part of a Trump administration effort “to tear down the protections of Americans’ health and safety and our environment.” An opponent, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), said: “Overturning EPA’s approval would force the state to adopt unnecessary pollution control measures, despite clear evidence that they would not meaningfully improve visibility.”

Advanced nuclear power can deliver that.”

Those words are not from an energy executive, a Trump Administration official, or a Chinese leader whose country is rapidly deploying nuclear power. Rather, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said them in a July 24, 2025, Op-Ed in USA Today.

Governor Hochul’s comments reflect one of the most important and under-reported aspects of energy policy: there is broad, bipartisan support for nuclear power, especially new forms of it, and the realization that it should be deployed quickly.

Presidents Biden and Trump agree on this, as do the vast majority of Members of Congress from both parties.

While many on the left snipe at fossil fuels and many on the right are critical of renewables, especially industrial-sized windmills, nuclear power has quietly built strong support. It remains the largest provider of emission-free power in the United States and has operated safely for nearly 70 years.

As part of a May 29, 2024, White House summit promoting new forms of nuclear energy, the Biden White House said, “a new generation of nuclear reactors is now capturing the attention of a wide range of stakeholders for nuclear energy’s ability to produce clean, reliable energy and meet the needs of a fast-growing economy.”

President Biden also led the push to enact the Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, which passed Congress by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and was signed into law on July 9, 2024. A central provision is to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors that have been developed and extensively evaluated.

Turning this support into the actual building of new nuclear facilities is now the chief challenge, and the Trump Administration is addressing it decisively and effectively.

For years, all forms of new energy construction in the United States have been impeded by red tape, significantly raising project costs and, when built at all, increasing costs to consumers.

Nowhere has this been more pronounced than in nuclear power, where just three new U.S. nuclear plants have come online in more than 25 years. This, despite the fact that commercial nuclear power has an impeccable safety record in the U.S., with no one dying a radiological death since the first plant went online in 1957.

On the President’s first day in office, he declared a national energy emergency, emphasizing the need for more energy in part to help the U.S. prevail in our AI competition with China. On May 23, President Trump issued an executive order to accelerate the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)’s testing of new nuclear reactors.

Following through on this, on August 12, the DoE announced it had selected 11 advanced reactor projects to move their projects towards deployment, with the goal of having three up and running by July 4, 2026. Importantly, DoE is also working closely with the prestigious Idaho National Laboratory to, it says, help “domestic reactor developers by resolving many technical and licensing issues that are generic to SMR technology.”

These steps are necessary because of the promise of new nuclear power and a long track record of historic delays in approvals and even decisions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These newer, smaller reactors are inherently safer than today’s larger reactors and have been extensively studied and tested.

Meanwhile, China is strongly expanding its use of nuclear power. According to the World Nuclear Association, 70 nuclear reactors are under construction worldwide, with 34 of them in China. In December, China also announced it would begin commercial operation of the first SMR in the first half of 2026. It will provide power for the island province of Hainan.

The U.S., meanwhile, should aim to have a bevy of new nuclear reactors operating and providing commercial power by 2028. Furthermore, major investments in new nuclear power by large technology companies, such as Amazon and Google, are offering the promise of lower-cost, clean, and highly efficient power.

The reality is that China is winning the energy race, and we need to catch up. We need regulators to decide whether to license projects and to continue inspecting and monitoring them. For denied applications, regulators should provide clear reasons so applicants can consider changes that are likely to receive approval.

For decades, the U.S. was the world’s unquestioned, preeminent leader in nuclear energy. The sooner we return to that position, the better for our economy and our people.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/691121_6_.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 14:16:09.064578

California Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking for $200 million to restart offering tax rebates for electric vehicles that are purchased in the state, making up for a similar federal program that President Donald Trump ended last year.

The proposal would require approval from state lawmakers, who are set to negotiate the broader California budget ahead of a July deadline.

Details on the new program, including the amount of individual rebates and which cars would be eligible, are still being discussed, said Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Buckley said in an email.

Newsom has gone back-and-forth on using California resources to backfill the federal EV tax credits Trump cut. An initial 2024 proposal had market-share caps that would have excluded Tesla Inc.’s best-selling models, drawing the ire of Elon Musk who called the plan “insane.” The proposal was later dropped as California’s budget gap widened, with Newsom then saying that the state “wouldn’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

California is the biggest EV market in the country and Newsom’s proposal could be a boon for struggling manufacturers.

Tesla and other automakers reported slowdowns and declines in electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter after the loss of federal incentives, following a rush from EV buyers taking advantage of an expired $7,500 federal credit.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, applauded Newsom’s proposal saying he “made clear that California will move forward forcefully with our clean energy and climate progress.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2026-01/EV-charging-getty-1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:00:02.542986

Published January 11, 2026

Rep. Chris Smith announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded $1.5 million in federal funding to the Ocean County Utilities Authority (OCUA) for a major wastewater treatment infrastructure improvement project.

The funding was secured through a congressional earmark Smith included in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 118-42). The funds will be used to replace and upgrade Primary Digester No. 2 at the Ocean County Utilities Authority’s Central Water Pollution Control Facilities, which serve Ocean County and parts of southern Monmouth County.

Smith said the project is intended to improve the longevity, durability, and reliability of the region’s wastewater treatment system. He added that the upgrades will help enhance environmental protection, operational efficiency, and the safe treatment and disposal of wastewater and related byproducts for both residential and commercial customers.

The congressman noted that the federal investment also helps return taxpayer dollars to New Jersey’s congressional district and supplements Ocean County’s capital expenditure budget for critical infrastructure needs.

Smith further stated that the $1.5 million allocation represents the first phase of federal support for the facility. A second earmark, totaling approximately $1.1 million, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives this week as part of the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act of 2026.

If the additional funding is approved by the U.S. Senate, Smith said the second tranche would become available sometime next year.

“Clean water infrastructure is essential,” Pallone said. “These investments help prevent environmental hazards, protect public health, and ensure that communities like Asbury Park and Perth Amboy can meet today’s challenges without pushing costs onto local taxpayers.”

The funding secured by Pallone includes $1 million for a new screenings system at the City of Asbury Park’s Wastewater Treatment Plant. The project will filter out debris that lead to system failures, helping the city avoid discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, particularly during the busy summer season when failures can disrupt tourism and pose environmental risks.

“On behalf of the City of Asbury Park, I want to thank Congressman Pallone for supporting this important project and recognizing the need to improve infrastructure at the city owned wastewater treatment facility. This project will directly improve efficiency of operations at our facility and help to protect our ocean and beaches,” said Mayor John Moor.

A separate $1 million allocation will support improvements at Perth Amboy’s Runyon Water Treatment Plant. The project will strengthen the plant’s ability to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in local water sources and help the city comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for managing those contaminants.

“This funding supports the long-term improvements we are already making to Perth Amboy’s water system. Upgrading the Runyon Water Treatment Plant will strengthen our ability to meet federal standards and ensure our residents continue to have safe, reliable drinking water. It’s a responsible investment in public health and in the future of our city’s infrastructure, and we appreciate Congressman Pallone’s support in helping move this work forward,” said Mayor Helmin J. Caba.

In 2025, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) supported communities recovering from Hurricane Helene, took actions to address PFAS contamination and continued to protect the state’s natural resources for the health and prosperity of all North Carolinians.

The monumental task of helping communities recover from Hurricane Helene, while rebuilding in a way that makes them more resilient to future storms, played a central role in the Department’s actions last year. In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 12 months on helping North Carolinians recover from the hurricane.

Link to By the Numbers

Aiding recovery, resiliency in WNC

In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 18 months on helping North Carolinians recover from Helene:

Awarded $365 million in grants for water infrastructure repairs and resiliency.

Mapped 4,000 landslides, helping North Carolinians stay safe from future slides.

Inspected 400 dams.

Awarded $12 million to clean up debris in streams and rivers.

Designated 177 debris collection sites.

In 2025, DEQ received the first federal funding through EPA to improve flood resiliency to drinking water, wastewater and septic systems affected by Hurricane Helene. The Division of Water Infrastructure received $685 million in supplemental funds and has completed two funding rounds using these funds to date.

The Dam Safety Program established the North Carolina Dam Safety Grant Fund in accordance with House Bill 1012 (SL2025-26), making $10 million in state funding available to dam owners for the rehabilitation and/or removal of Hurricane Helene damaged high-hazard dams.

In August, EPA awarded DEQ a $61 million grant for Hurricane Helene State Program Support for Hazardous Waste Management. The grant will run through Sept. 30, 2030, and will assist North Carolina with emergency response and recovery from Hurricane Helene. It also will fund preparations for emergency recovery as related to DEQ’s hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, recycling and materials management, emergency response programs and pesticide management.

DEQ created the Western NC Recovery Grants Program that provides free, customized grant writing support to local governments and partner nonprofits in Western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene. The program objective is to help impacted communities secure federal and state funding for long-term recovery projects.

NC Geological Survey staff mapped more than 2,600 landslides resulting from Hurricane Helene and responded to more than 400 landslides.

The NC General Assembly allocated emergency disaster recovery funding to DEQ’s Underground Storage Tank Section (UST) to assist owners and operators with testing and repairing tanks that store petroleum and hazardous substances and were damaged by Hurricane Helene. The program provides temporary financial assistance for emergency services until owners receive federal disaster relief funds or insurance reimbursements. Loans are interest-free and mature upon the earlier of receiving federal disaster relief or other funding, or by June 30, 2030. As of November, DEQ had received 11 loan agreements for more than $1.2 million.

DEQ received an EPA grant (with state matching funds) totaling more than $15.8 million to assess and cleanup spills of petroleum from USTs damage by Hurricane Helene. The grant will run through March 31, 2030, and can be extended an additional two years. The UST section has identified more than 15 sites that may be eligible for funding. Assessment or corrective action is underway at nine facilities. Evaluation of additional sites is ongoing.

The Division’s Solid Waste Section approved 177 sites for temporary management of debris from Hurricane Helene. The section also worked with regional officials and residents to manage the debris.

In the aftermath of Helene, the Asheville Regional Office assisted by the Winston Salem Regional Office conducted more than 400 dam safety inspections.

The State Energy Office (SEO) launched a $5 million Clean Energy Microgrid Initiative to deploy small solar-powered microgrid systems in areas that lost power due to Hurricane Helene. As of December, five microgrid sites had been selected and materials were being purchased.

DEQ received the first federal funding for onsite decentralized wastewater to support Hurricane Helene recovery. The $22.5 million EPA award is currently open for applications through the Division of Water Infrastructure until March 2, 2026, and funds the replacement and repair of septic systems in a 39-county region of WNC.

DEQ awarded a $10 million grant to MountainTrue, an Asheville based nonprofit, to clean up debris from 125 miles of streams. Funding from DEQ has allowed the organization to hire 79 workers, who removed an average 10,000 pounds of debris from Western NC waterways daily.

Investing in Communities and Building Resiliency

In 2025, the State Water Infrastructure Authority awarded more than $877 million in loans and grants to update and harden drinking water, wastewater and septic systems, limit chemical pollution (PFAS), replace lead pipes and assist towns damaged by Hurricane Helene while improving resiliency for future storms.

The State Resilience Office (SRO) joined DEQ in July to support resilience-building statewide. The SRO, previously at the N.C. Department of Public Safety, supports local governments and their partners to plan for and invest in resilience initiatives. The SRO also manages the NC Resilience Exchange, an online toolbox of resilience resources and staffs the Interagency Resilience Team, a partnership of state agencies working to promote resilience efforts across state government.

SRO, in partnership with the State Climate Office, kicked off its second Planning for Extreme Heat Cohort Program. Nine local governments from the coast to the mountains participated in the program with the goal of developing a local heat action plan. Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related impact.

In January, SRO published the NC Resilient Communities Planning Guide to help local leaders, especially local governments, plan for a more resilient future in their communities. This two-volume tool guides users through the process of understanding their vulnerabilities and developing a project plan to address them.

The NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint program awarded $25.2 million to projects in 16 counties to build more resilient communities and protect lives, property and livelihoods across North Carolina. The program, through partnerships with agencies such as the NC Land and Water Fund, NC Emergency Management and the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, funded more than 73 projects valued at more than $78 million in total. The total investment from the Blueprint program for these initiatives amounted to over $34.4 million, demonstrating a highly efficient use of state resources where program dollars are working twice as hard through leveraged funding.

The Blueprint Tool, posted in April, serves as a resource for communities, local governments and partners by providing accurate, data-driven flood-risk and vulnerability assessments.

The Blueprint released its first progress report in March.

The NCGS brought in record external funding this year with 11 grant projects totaling more than $2 million. The projects cover an array of topics from foundational geologic mapping needs to critical minerals and rare earth element studies to data preservation.

In 2025, the Division of Mitigation Services (DMS), initiated 14 new mitigation projects that will permanently protect approximately 97 acres of wetlands along with nearly 20 miles of stream and 91 acres of riparian buffer. These projects represent an investment of approximately $59 million to restore and protect natural resources in North Carolina. DMS currently manages 206 active and ongoing mitigation projects.

In 2025, DMS received mitigation credit releases valuing more than $40 million. In addition, 29 projects were closed out resulting in:

16.2 miles of stream restored and protected

174.2 acres of wetland restored and protected

92.66 acres riparian buffer area restored and protected

20.92 acres of Nitrogen and Phosphorous nutrient offset

In 2025, DMS assisted 235 development projects by taking responsibility for 270 new mitigation requirements including:

58,206.6 stream credits

80.9 wetland credits

1,367,513.8 riparian (streambank) buffer credits (equivalent to 31.39 acres)

6,388.45 Nutrient Offset Nitrogen credits (equivalent to 2.8 acres)

3,514.7 Nutrient Offset Phosphorus credits (equivalent to 24 acres)

DMS and Ecosystem Planning and Restoration completed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for the existing and future conditions (after implementation of flood mitigation projects) of the Stoney Creek watershed. The Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program’s first pilot project, a stormwater wetland basin on the Wayne Community College campus in Goldsboro, was completed in December. Construction on a second natural infrastructure project in the Stoney Creek watershed should begin in early 2026.

The State Energy Office’s Weatherization Assistance Program completed work in 1,380 households, including repairing or replacing 543 heating units and weatherizing 838 homes.

SEO reached agreement with three weatherization agencies for a combined contract value of more than $33 million to begin delivery of weatherization services with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in four of the seven program regions.

The $208 million Energy Saver North Carolina program Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs launched Jan. 16, 2025, which includes the Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) rebates.

As of December, the program processed applications in 98 of the North Carolina’s 100 counties. Residents in Mecklenburg and Wake counties can apply beginning in January 2026.

2,600 North Carolinians completed an application.

Approximately $650,000 rebates paid.

An estimated 293,000 kilowatts annually saved.

Households participating in the program will realize an estimated annual average savings of $945.

SEO selected nine projects to receive $2.79 million in Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants. The projects will reduce energy usage and lower costs for local governments, state agencies and universities.

Seven subawardees were selected for nearly $20 million in funding to improve North Carolina’s electric grid: the City of Wilson, Duke Energy Carolinas, Fayetteville Public Works Commission, Four County Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), Surry Yadkin EMC, Tideland EMC and the City of Gastonia. The request for proposals for the next funding round of about $9.7 million will be released in 2026.

The Utility Savings Initiative saved $159 million in avoided utility costs in fiscal 2024–25 and a cumulative $2.26 billion in avoided costs since fiscal 2002–03 by using efficiency improvements across state facilities.

The Division of Air Quality (DAQ) awarded $1.91 million for new public electric vehicle chargers across North Carolina, filling gaps in the state’s charging network along highways and in rural communities. The projects will prevent more than 657 tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere and will avoid 125 pounds of nitrogen oxide emissions and 1,191 pounds of volatile organic compound emissions.

DAQ awarded $1.14 million in grants for clean vehicle projects, including more than $270,000 for new all-electric vehicles. These awards are projected to eliminate 3,483 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 57 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 7,700 pounds of fine particulate matter emissions.

The Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) received $26 million in EPA funding in October for grants to local communities in western North Carolina to improve recycling operations damaged by Hurricane Helene and to conduct recycling and waste management workshops for disaster preparedness.

DEACS awarded $1.17 million (plus $1.11 million in matching funds) in recycling grant funding to 19 businesses and 15 local governments for projects that are expected to create 31 jobs and divert 25,000 tons of material from landfills annually.

DCM’s Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP) awarded $6 million to 32 communities across coastal North Carolina. A total of $1.9 million was allocated to cover technical assistance in risk assessment and resilience planning, as well as incorporating resiliency into Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) Land Use Plans. Grants totaling more than $4 million were awarded to communities to support engineering, design and construction.

DCM’s Public Beach and Coastal Waterfront Access Program awarded more than $2.25 million in grants to support 10 projects that will expand and improve public access to North Carolina’s beaches and coastal waterways. The next round of funding for this program will be announced in January 2026.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service awarded a $1 million coastal wetlands grant to DCM for the purchase of The South End at Topsail Beach. This is the final portion of the total $8 million that was required for the conservation of this ecologically rich barrier island property. The South End consists of more than 100 biodiverse acres of salt marsh, maritime forest, dune and beach on a dynamic ocean inlet. The NC Coastal Land Trust will execute the purchase and transfer the property to DCM, which will maintain it as a public access area in cooperation with the town of Topsail Beach.

DCM received $227,833 in funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program, which provides funding to marinas and other boating facilities for outdoor recreation. The funding will allow staff to training opportunities.

The Division of Water Resources awarded more than $2.6 million in grants to support stream restoration, water-based recreation and water management projects across North Carolina. The total includes nearly $2.3 million awarded through two different grant cycles of the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects fund, and $350,880 to support two stream restoration projects on agricultural lands through a cost-sharing program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

DWR awarded more than $9.39 million for five projects in coastal North Carolina for beach and dune renourishment. There were five projects that received funding from the Coastal Storm Damage Mitigation Fund, which is funded by the N.C. General Assembly through Session Law 2023-134 for costs associated with beach nourishment, artificial dunes and other projects to mitigate or remediate coastal storm damage to the ocean beaches and dune systems of the state.

DWR awarded more than $5.8 million in grants in funding from the Flood Resiliency Blueprint to support projects that provide flood reduction or flood resiliency benefits across the following six river basins across North Carolina: Cape Fear, French Broad, Lumber, Neuse, Tar Pamlico & White Oak basins. The grants were awarded to 10 local governments through a one-time appropriation of flood resiliency funding received through the NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint administered through the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects program.

Protecting North Carolinians from Forever Chemicals

DEQ continues to lead on addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in North Carolina, guided by the Action Strategy for PFAS. DEQ continues to work on limiting PFAS discharges to the environment, protecting public health and addressing remediation efforts to clean up existing PFAS contamination. The Division of Waste Management (DWM) continues to direct Chemours Co. Fayetteville Works plant to sample private wells and provide alternate water as warranted based on results. DEQ has also required Chemours to expand sampling to an area that now encompasses 10 counties.

The Bernard Allen Memorial Emergency Drinking Water Fund, administered by DWM, continues to notify persons whose private wells are at risk of PFAS contamination, test private wells for PFAS and provide alternate drinking water to owners of wells contaminated by PFAS. The program sampled 414 private wells for PFAS and provided drinking water to 113 residences in the past fiscal year. Requests for sampling of private wells continue to increase.

DWM’s Solid Water Section has required all permitted sanitary landfills to sample their facilities’ groundwater monitoring networks for PFAS and has directed facilities to update receptor surveys and sample private wells and provide alternate water when applicable. The majority of DWM programs are directing drycleaning facilities, pre-regulatory landfills, permitted hazardous waste facilities and inactive hazardous facilities to evaluate PFAS effects and where applicable direct these facilities to complete updated private-well receptor surveys and provide alternate water where applicable.

DEQ’s Division of Water Resources worked with Sampson County Disposal LLC to develop a special order of consent that requires SCD to begin testing groundwater and water runoff from the Sampson County Landfill for PFAS and eventually reduce the compounds by 90%. Sampson County Landfill is the first landfill with a proposed direct discharge that will install an advanced treatment system designed for PFAS removal.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section staff coordinated with DWI to hire a contractor to develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan that has been submitted to EPA for approval. The plan will allow Federal Emerging Contaminants Small and Disadvantaged Community Grant funds to be used by DWM and the PWS Section to collect hundreds of samples to test for PFAS in drinking water and provide technical assistance to affected communities.

DWR’s Groundwater Resources Branch completed its initial round of statewide groundwater PFAS sampling of a statewide network of groundwater monitoring wells. DWR has incorporated additional follow-up PFAS sampling into the branch's routine sampling process.

DWR, at the request of the Environmental Management Commission, developed proposed rules that would establish industrial users discharging wastewater at publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities (POTWs) and direct dischargers to perform for one year baseline monitoring for three PFAS compounds: PFOS, PFOA and GenX. Dischargers that have results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the PFAS compounds. POTWs will submit to DWR annual reports on the activities of significant industrial users. Industries will continue water sampling and following plans until the three PFAS compounds cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

At the request of the Environmental Management Commission, DWR developed proposed rules to minimize 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA has identified as a likely carcinogen. The rules would require large industrial users discharging wastewater for treatment at POTWs and direct dischargers that likely have 1,4-dioxane in their wastewater perform baseline monitoring for the compound for one year. Dischargers showing sampling results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate 1,4-dioxane. Industrial practices will be summarized, and POTWs will submit annual reports to DWR. Industries will continue water sampling until the compound cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

Additional accomplishments

DAQ released an update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a continued trend of declining air pollution emissions and improved air quality. In August, North Carolina celebrated being in compliance with every federal health-based air quality standard for 10 consecutive years, which benefits public health and the economy. Among the 20 most populous states in the U.S., North Carolina has the longest running streak of being in statewide attainment with the standards.

For the second time in its history, DAQ recorded no exceedances of the ozone air quality standard during the year.

DAQ upgraded the Air Quality Portal’s public mapping tool, the Ambient Information Reporter. Improvements include a new Air Quality Index layer, measuring fine particulate data and a better display of surface visibility data.

DWM’s Brownfields Redevelopment Section celebrated the 750th Brownfields Agreement at a site known as Brown School, which has been transformed into an affordable housing community called the Brown School Lofts at Legacy Heights.

DEQ’s environmental education program hosted 30 livestreamed talks with top researchers and educators in partnership with the NC Museum of Natural Sciences that reached more than 7,000 viewers this year. The talks are broadcast on YouTube and shared with schools, universities and colleges, state agencies and the public.

In 2025, 46 educators achieved the NC Environmental Education Certification, a nationally recognized professional credential managed by the DEQ in partnership with various state agencies. The program saw strong growth with 92 new enrollments, with both classroom teachers and nonformal educators pursuing their certification. To earn the certification, participants must commit to 200 hours of professional development, community leadership and instruction.

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program team submitted to EPA its Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which details 14 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and presents ways to reduce statewide emissions by 50% by 2030 from the 2005 baseline, and attain net-zero by 2050.

The Department submitted an updated NC Energy Security Plan to the Department of Energy that included new sections on critical infrastructure and cross-sector dependencies, emergency preparedness and response, energy sector threats and impacts, a risk assessment, and risk mitigation and coordination.

The NC Geological Survey digitized about 500 geophysical well logs and created an online viewing tool, allowing for easier and deeper analyses without specialized software.

The NC Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) Study and Evaluation Tool was completed in association with Applied Weather Associates in May. The PMP replaces outdated values provided in hydrometeorological reports. The study relies on the most current practices for defining PMP, including comprehensive storm analyses procedures, extensive use of geographical information systems, explicit quantification of topography and coastal effects, updated maximum dew point and sea surface temperature climatology for storm adjustments, and improved understanding of weather and climate related to extreme rainfall in the region.

Nearly 40 experts attended two workshops held by the Coastal Reserves program to develop habitat resilience plans for the Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island reserves. Attendees addressed habitat vulnerability and risk, research, monitoring and solutions. The Masonboro Island Reserve workshop yielded a list of 41 research and monitoring needs to foster future resilience at the site. Products from the Zeke's island Reserve workshop are under development.

DCM’s Local Permit Officer Program held a two-day workshop in May for 60-plus officers in central and southern sites and in October for Northern/Northeastern officers. The workshops included field trips to Manteo and Swansboro and included presentations by Division staff and other state and federal agencies representatives, rule updates, hands-on training in the field and dialogue/discussions with questions and answer sessions.

DCM celebrated the 40th anniversary of the state’s National Estuarine Research Reserve, designated by the state and NOAA to protect special places in the state, including the Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island Reserves. This designation inspired the state to later create the umbrella N.C. Coastal Reserve, which is authorized by the N.C. Coastal Area Management Act.

Across all reserve sites, the total value of DEQ’s volunteer program was $38,374.13. (1,340.75 reported volunteer hours valued at $33.01/hour.) 500-plus pounds of marine debris removed by volunteers.

DMF, in cooperation with the NC Department of Information Technology and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, put into effect Dec. 1 new harvest reporting requirements for recreational and commercial fishermen.

DMF’s Observer Program launched in February the automated Observer Trip Scheduling System, which schedules observer trips for Estuarine Gill Net Permit holders. The Division worked with the N.C. Department of Information Technology and volunteer commercial fishermen to develop the system, which is a requirement of North Carolina’s Endangered Species Act Section 10 Incidental Take Permit.

DMF completed and implemented four fishery management plans — for Spotted Seatrout, Eastern Oyster, Hard Clam and Southern Flounder — that were adopted by the N.C. Marine Fisheries Commission.

The Artificial Reef Program finalized its five-year timeline for ocean reef enhancements, funded by Coastal Recreational Fishing License revenue. The Artificial Reef Program plans to complete one project per year, for a total of five projects, one in each coastal region.

The Utility Scale Solar Decommissioning Program rules went live Aug. 1 and allows project owners to create an online account to register utility-scale solar projects, upload decommissioning plans and financial assurance mechanism documents, pay registration fees and update project.

DWR protects water quality in North Carolina by processing permits, certifications and conducting inspections for facilities that discharge wastewater. DWR staff responded to resident complaints and investigated wetland and streambank vegetation to ensure compliance with state law. Regional staff:

Inspected 707 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted facilities, 100 sanitary sewer collection systems, 583 non-discharge wastewater treatment facilities and 1,872 animal feeding operations.

Responded to 1,609 individual incidents and complaints.

Completed 1,025 stream determinations and 967 wetland/buffer inspections and investigations.

Performed, with support from the Public Water Supply Section, approximately 5,400 site visits, including 1,835 sanitary surveys.

DWR’s 401 water quality certification program, which assesses and regulates water quality construction damage to streams, streambanks and wetlands, issued 2,534 certifications. The program’s average processing time for the certifications was 29 days, less than half the program’s goal of 60 days.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section Plan Review Unit reviewed 93% of 1,553 drinking water infrastructure engineering projects as of Dec. 12 for compliance with public water system state rules.

DWR launched a tool to display the results of freshwater sampling conducted through the WNC Recreational Water Quality Monitoring program to help the public identify locations where E. coli levels are above or below recreational guidance values in three river basins.

Between Nov. 24, 2024, and Oct. 25, 2025, DWR’s Water Sciences Section laboratories reported 150,769 compound results.

As of Nov. 20, DWR’s Algae Lab resolved 332 reports received on the Fish Kill & Algal Bloom Dashboard, an interactive tracking tool.

DWR completed 2,847 water quality sampling visits through the Ambient Monitoring System, and 351 visits through the Random Ambient Monitoring System. These two programs provide key data to track water quality across the state.

Otherwise, the progress achieved in installed renewable capacity could be undermined by unresolved structural constraints.","Renewable energy sources now represent 65% of installed power generation capacity across Latin America and the Caribbean — a historic milestone for the region’s energy transition.

However, this does not mean that renewables deliver the same share of electricity in real time. The gap between installed capacity and effective generation remains one of the most significant technical challenges facing the regional power system.

According to the regional electricity market monitoring report, renewable generation reached 71% of total output in June 2025, with hydropower alone contributing 51%. Yet in July — during the dry season — this figure fell to 65% or lower.

This seasonal variability highlights that, at certain times of the year, the system still needs to rely on fossil fuel-based technologies such as natural gas and fuel oil to guarantee security of supply.

For Antonio S.R. Lopez, CEO of A&M TECHNOLOGY, the discrepancy between installed capacity and actual generation is structural rather than temporary.

“Installed capacity figures do not always translate linearly into the electricity delivered to the system,” he explained, stressing that the most pressing gaps lie in energy storage, limited operational flexibility, and the need for more accurate resource forecasting.

Lopez also warned that existing transmission infrastructure must be strengthened to sustain high levels of renewable generation under all weather conditions.

Price exposure to fossil fuels remains

From an economic perspective, the region has yet to overcome its exposure to fossil fuels. Spot electricity prices continue to be anchored to thermal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output, regional congestion or demand peaks.

While renewables help to cushion price volatility, they have not yet fully decoupled electricity prices from gas and fuel oil. According to the regional report, achieving genuine price decoupling will require:

Greater energy storage capacity

A more flexible power grid

Upgraded regional transmission infrastructure

Ancillary services markets that properly value the technical attributes of renewable generation

2026: a turning point for system operation

Demand projections towards 2026 present a new operational challenge for the regional power system. Although most new generation is expected to come from renewable sources such as solar PV and wind power, the absence of structural solutions — particularly storage and flexibility — could turn this growth into a critical operational bottleneck.

Lopez was clear in his assessment:

“Renewable expansion will be the main driver, but without storage and flexibility, system operation will not be sustainable.”

Regional integration through the Mercado Eléctrico Regional (MER) could play a key role in addressing these challenges. The MER already enables more efficient dispatch, cost reductions and enhanced energy security through cross-border electricity trading. However, its current architecture was not designed to manage the variability of intermittent renewable sources.

At an operational level, further regulatory adjustments are still required to integrate ancillary services, improve dispatch mechanisms and enable the participation of distributed energy resources. While renewables have expanded the potential for regional energy integration, limited transmission capacity has become a major constraint on absorbing large and variable power flows.

Lopez concluded that market design must evolve so renewable resources can be fully integrated — not only from a technical standpoint, but also commercially and economically. Otherwise, the progress achieved in installed renewable capacity could be undermined by unresolved structural constraints.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Energia-Estrategica-56.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:40.362389

The key difference between hybrids and EVs is that the decision to build them is market driven.
Automakers should hurry to make hybrids the inevitable future transportation technology before the power pendulum in Washington swings to bring back the zero-emissions crowd.","The following editorial originally appeared in The Detroit News:

The auto industry is headed back to where it should have stayed in the quest to put a cleaner fleet on the road: hybrids. Automakers are rapidly backing away from plans to fully electrify their offerings, due to an easing of fuel economy and emissions mandates by the Trump administration and continued resistance from consumers.

But that doesn’t mean they are totally abandoning their green ambitions. Rather, most manufacturers are making the commonsense decision to expand the hybrid market. They are putting more hybrid models in showrooms and continuing to perfect the technology to achieve greater fuel efficiency.

That’s what they should have done in the first place. But government regulators bowed to the demand from environmentalists for a 100 percent switch to zero-emissions vehicles on a pace that ignored consumer wariness and the practical challenges to going all electric.

Hybrids were the first step away from traditional internal combustion engines. They enjoyed consumer confidence and did not require a complete remake of the vehicles that motorists were used to driving.

And best of all, they didn’t need a new national charging network. Because they have both a gasoline engine and electric motor, they can fuel up at existing gas stations.

Perhaps they made too much sense. But the industry, with Washington’s hand on its back, largely blew past hybrids and committed billions to developing and building EVs.

Practicality is now prevailing. Sales of hybrids were up 20 percent in the third quarter of 2025, according to analytics firm PwC, and the surge is expected to continue this year.

Most automakers have revamped their strategy to get as many hybrids as possible in showrooms, as soon as possible. Toyota, which never abandoned hybrids, is selling its popular Sienna and Camry brands only in hybrid versions. General Motors, which not so long ago was committed to an all-in EV strategy, is reintroducing plug-in hybrids.

It’s all good news for consumers. EVs carry an average sticker price of $59,200, compared with $47,500 for a hybrid. And in the U.S. market, there are currently 87 hybrid models to choose from.

While not as fuel efficient as an all-electric vehicle, they still reduce fuel costs by roughly 35 percent compared to standard gas-powered models, and you can drive them wherever you want without the charging anxiety that haunts EV drivers.

Some motorists prefer EVs, and they aren’t going away. But America has always needed a vehicle for the masses, and hybrids adequately fill that role in today’s transportation mix.

The key difference between hybrids and EVs is that the decision to build them is market driven. Automakers should hurry to make hybrids the inevitable future transportation technology before the power pendulum in Washington swings to bring back the zero-emissions crowd.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:05.693666

But speakers at a morning panel moderated by Alliance executive director Frank Sesno noted remarkable progress despite wavering American commitment.
Despite a coordinated public disinformation campaign, however, public opinion continues to be in favor of action on climate change.","The George Washington University’s Alliance for a Sustainable Future joined the Embassy of France to cohost “Paris Climate Agreement 10 Years On: What’s Changed, What’s Next?” last month, a summit exploring global progress and setbacks since the legally binding international treaty was signed by 195 countries in 2015. The event also marked the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, which had ended a few days before.

“Ten years after the Paris Climate Agreement, the science is clear and the stakes are growing ever higher,” GW President Ellen M. Granberg said at the summit, pointing out that the World Meteorological Organization records nine of the 10 hottest years on record as occurring in the last decade, and that by 2050 the world’s population is likely to reach nearly 10 billion, all of whom will require food, energy and water.

The launching of the Alliance at GW in 2023 reflects the demand for international, multidisciplinary solutions to these complex challenges, Granberg said. And its impact is concrete: Students and faculty from the Alliance and from GW’s Sustainability Research Institute were on the ground at COP30, “working alongside local leaders to shape the next phase of climate policy.”

“Our students are acutely aware that the planet is at risk and that they need to be change agents, and I am so proud of all they are doing to make a difference…They represent the essential role universities play in advancing solutions and GW's commitment to scholarship that leads to action.”

Hundreds of diplomats, scientists, experts and on-the-ground leaders, including GW students, faculty and staff, gathered at the summit to assess the decade and discuss what's been accomplished and what lies ahead.

The adoption of the Paris Agreement “was universally acknowledged as a major diplomatic breakthrough [and] was considered an example of what cultural multilateralism can achieve at its best,” French Ambassador Laurent Bili said, recalling “the enthusiasm and positive energy that was felt at the time.”

In the years since, progress has been mixed. Local and international actions have likely averted the most pessimistic climate change scenarios, and Bili pointed to “spectacular progress in the areas of affordability and renewables.” But the international community is likely to fall short of the agreement’s central goal—limiting average global temperature increase to under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels—making continued action urgent and necessary.

“Inaction is not an option, and I'm glad that we have students in the audience who are ready to take on the fight for a sustainable future,” Bili said.

The United States’ withdrawal from the agreement (which would be echoed, weeks after the summit, by withdrawal from the bedrock 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and President Donald Trump’s denial of climate change hovered over the daylong conversation. With China and India, the U.S. is one of the planet’s top three greenhouse gas emitters and therefore one of the most important players in meaningful carbon reduction.

But speakers at a morning panel moderated by Alliance executive director Frank Sesno noted remarkable progress despite wavering American commitment. The science around global carbon monitoring has improved, climate models are more refined, and some steps toward fossil fuel reduction have meaningfully progressed, including increased global use of renewable energy like wind and solar, decreased costs for these energy sources and a widening market share for electric vehicles. More and more, climate adaptation is being viewed “not just as a cost but as an investment that in the long term actually pays off,” said panelist Pierre Gentine, professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University.

In the U.S., local jurisdictions now stand on the front line of that investment. Speakers Charles Allen, Ward 6 member for the D.C. City Council, and Serena C. McIlwain, Maryland state secretary of the environment, discussed the practical impact of the Paris agreement in their regions and the ambitious climate agendas they and their colleagues have championed in the capital region.

Locally, the “economic momentum” of adaptation “is undeniable,” McIlwain said, noting that dozens of companies have launched clean energy operations in Maryland from which thousands of jobs are projected to develop. “Clean means the economy wins too.”

In a keynote address, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the only elected federal official to attend COP30, pointed to the cozy relationship between the Trump administration and the fossil fuel industry as jeopardizing climate adaptation and, by extension, American lives. Despite a coordinated public disinformation campaign, however, public opinion continues to be in favor of action on climate change. Whitehouse pointed to polling that showed 74% of respondents supported making corporations pay for harm caused by their pollution, with just 10% opposed.

“So here's a political issue that has a 64% positive margin for us—what’s not to like about that?” he said. “But in order to animate that, we've got to take advantage of it. We've got to make sure we are making that argument loud and clear and without hesitancy.”",https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5401/files/styles/large/public/2026-01/paris_climate_agreement_10_years_2025_wla_an0a6230.jpg?itok=NS2vjW6y,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:46.497465

The negotiations had to weather the efforts of some countries to water down language of certain resolutions, difficulty agreeing the budget for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the absence of the United States from many discussions.

As well as a declaration signed by environment ministers, 11 resolutions were adopted at this the seventh UN Environment Assembly (UNEA7), which is held biennially in Nairobi, Kenya. These concerned issues including protecting coral reefs as the ocean warms, cleaner management of minerals and metals, and addressing a “massive influx” of sargassum seaweed in the Atlantic Ocean.

Recommended

Tanzanian delegate Richard Muyungi is chair of the Africa Group of Negotiators, which represents 54 African countries at the UN climate negotiations. He emphasised the importance of UNEA7 achieving agreement on UNEP’s strategy for 2026-2029, which included the 2026-2027 programme of work and budget. That amounts to USD 1.1 billion to be distributed among UNEP’s programmes, an increase on the 2024-2025 budget of USD 869 million.

Muyungi, whose country is rich in minerals and forests, said the meeting “gives us a sense of how the global community is ready to work with our continent to address the challenges we are facing: whether it is climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, ocean acidification or the loss of coral reefs.” He added: “The outcome will inform in the longer term how we can better manage our environment in Africa while ensuring sustainable development”.

Multilateralism under strain

UNEP’s executive director, Inger Andersen, acknowledged to Dialogue Earth that multilateralism is under strain but was bullish.

“What’s the alternative to multilaterialism?” she said. “UNEP has been actively promoting environmental conservation for over half a century, and despite the recent change of direction of some countries, the markets are talking.” She gave the example of Texas, “an oil-producing state that has invested in renewable energy covering the supply of 40% of its electricity demand.”

Andersen said that while the UN and the multilateral system are not moving fast enough, they are trying to speed up. She noted the importance of synergies among multilateral agreements. Nineteen conventions are represented at the UNEA, on topics from chemicals to wildlife trade and plastics.

“I rarely engage with science deniers – we’re a scientific agency – but I would tell them that the price of action today is cheaper than with a 2.3C global warming scenario,” she said. Andersen drew on some of the key messages contained in the 7th Global Environment Outlook report which was launched at UNEA7. An update on the one published in 2019, it contains clearer science, particularly on the scourge of plastics for human health and the environment.

Plastics treaty revival: ‘If you’re not on the table, you’re in the menu’

UNEA7’s ministerial declaration, which closed the negotiations, anounced broad actions to promote international environmental governance.

It mentioned the resolution on ending plastic pollution, adopted by UNEA in 2022. Andrés Del Castillo, senior attorney at the Geneva-based Center for International Environmental Law, noted the “very ambitious language” of that resolution, which seeks to control pollution throughout plastics’ life cycle.

Del Castillo said the declaration, which was signed by all UNEA member states except the US, “emphasises the commitment to continue the negotiation process for the plastics treaty … within the UN system.”

But he believes geopolitical forces will make environmental governance challenging in 2026. Though ambitious countries are beginning to make many concessions, the other side is less generous, he says, especially on the issue of plastics.

He celebrated the adoption of the 2026-2029 strategy but warned of the strings attached regarding gender and human rights. A group of countries whose economies strongly depends on fossil fuels had only approved the strategy on condition UNEP dropped its recognition of the connections between human rights, gender and the environment.

“UNEP’s room for manoeuvre has been restricted,” he said. “The head of the agency will be constrained by a new agenda that is trying to limit the intersections between human rights and the environment.” However, the ministerial declaration does include a mention of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, Del Castillo noted.

He believes the US will most likely continue to engage in the plastics negotiations, as requested by its manufacturing industry. This is despite the country saying in Nairobi that it had “made a considered decision to step back from negotiations on all UNEA resolutions, decisions and the ministerial declaration.” On 7 January, the US also announced its withdrawal from 31 UN bodies, though it remains a formal member of UNEP.

Del Castillo concluded: “In diplomacy there’s an old saying – if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”

Progress on sargassum: A win for West Africa and the Caribbean

One of the resolutions approved at UNEA7 focussed on a proposal by the Dominican Republic, and endorsed by Barbados, Jamaica, Ghana and Sierra Leone, to strengthen a global response to sargassum blooms in the Atlantic.

Record volumes of this floating seaweed reached the Caribbean and West Africa in 2025, badly impacting tourism and marine ecosystems.

July 2025 set a new record of 38 million metric tonnes for the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, 70% higher than the previous record set in July 2022. According to experts, this may be primarily due to warmer ocean water and stronger winds in spring.

Claudia Taboada, the Dominican Republic’s sole delegate at UNEA7, said some countries had tried to undermine efforts to get the sargassum resolution passed. Environmental multilateralism is being deliberately eroded, she said. “Having a [resolution] that refers to a ‘severe escalating socio-economic and environmental issue’ is … less powerful than calling it a ‘crisis’.”

“Questioning science, reopening already closed consensuses and relativising issues such as the special circumstances of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) is not a technical difference. It is a political strategy that puts years of progress at risk,” she told Dialogue Earth. “Allowing language manoeuvres to empty our collective decisions of content is unacceptable.”

The adoption of the resolution does, however, represent “a first step towards placing a global interest on the sargassum crisis … and a high-level discussion which will allow us to return reloaded to UNEA8 with an implementation progress report, and hopefully with a political landscape more favourable to our region’s interests.”

A call to accelerate action

Tabi Joda is an ecosystem revivalist and lead of the One Billion Trees for Africa initiative. He travels across the Sahel – a semi-arid region bordering the Sahara Desert – to coordinate reforestation efforts. The initiative can provide environmental services and economic opportunities to communities fighting desertification, he explains.

Desertification such as in the Sahel is creating conflicts and driving migration, as herders and farmers compete for scarce water and pastures.

“We could have a mosaic of biodiversity that would allow for social cohesion, we just need spaces like UNEA to move from mainstream topics to those that have a real impact, like our project in the Sahel,” said Joda.

His call to include more Indigenous knowledge and practices to support science connects with the conservation efforts of Wanjira Maathai, managing director for Africa and global partnerships at the World Resources Institute. She says the health impacts of air pollution are forcing African governments to act, while also putting women closer to decision making.

But her organisation’s annual State of Climate Action report shows the world is off track on all 45 indicators on climate action.

Amermin notes that critical materials and minerals are crucial for modern life and are used across nearly every industrial sector, including defense, nuclear power, energy, aerospace, agriculture, construction, healthcare and technology. However, the company adds that these materials often are mined in foreign countries at a high cost, putting pressure on the global supply chain and forcing reliance on volatile trading partners and nations with “substandard” mining regulations.

“We appreciate the DOE’s confidence in Amermin to establish a reliable domestic source of critical materials and minerals, addressing important supply chain and national security issues,” Amermin CEO Ryan McAdams says. “This funding will enable Amermin to increase the output of tungsten carbide by 300 percent through the expansion of our state-of-the-art tungsten carbide reclamation facility, reducing our country’s reliance on foreign nations like China, which produces 83 percent of the world’s tungsten supply. We know that America’s future depends on access to critical materials, and together we are charting a new path in American innovation.”

Amermin says it specializes in tungsten, copper, nickel, cobalt and graphite processing, returning those materials to manufacturing specifications and extending their life cycles.

The company, founded in 2017, tells Recycling Today it plans to use the DOE funding to scale operations and expand its footprint at its 80-acre campus currently under construction in Briggs, Texas. The company says it expects the expansion—which includes increased metallurgical laboratory capabilities and additional processing lines—to be complete in the second quarter of this year.

To date, McAdams says Amermin and its sister company, Drill Bit Exchange, have recycled more than 56 million pounds of material sourced from a variety of industries, such as energy, oil and gas, aerospace, defense, manufacturing, technology, construction and automotive. In particular, Amermin’s capabilities include proprietary electrochemical processing, mineral/metal concentration, refining, sizing and blending.

The grant was awarded to Melt Technologies L.P., which does business as Amermin, an asset recovery and processing business. Amermin is a sister company to Drill Bit Exchange, which provides asset recovery solutions for the drill bit industry.

“I am thrilled that Amermin was selected and approved by the U.S. Department of Energy to increase its production of critical minerals, directly aiding American oil and gas producers,” says U.S. Rep.

Federal Employee First Amendment Lawsuit Advances

Right of Federal Workers to Engage in Off-Duty Activism at Stake

Washington, DC — A federal district court judge has rejected a government effort to dismiss a free speech lawsuit brought by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) on behalf of a federal employee who was threatened with criminal prosecution and disciplined for engaging in environmental advocacy on her personal time. The case now proceeds to litigation on the merits with the judge having already ruled against the agency’s interpretation of the legal questions at stake.

The employee, Carolyn McConnell, is a field attorney with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) based in Seattle. She is also a leader of a non-profit conservation group advocating for protection of national parks and forests in the Pacific Northwest. After she co-authored an op-ed supporting national park staffing, the NLRB declared that her activities constituted a conflict of interest and requested that she be criminally prosecuted. After the U.S. Attorney declined prosecution, the NLRB threatened Ms. McConnell with disciplinary action if she persisted in her public advocacy, even though McConnell’s advocacy was completely unrelated to her work for the NLRB.

In a ruling handed down on January 8, U.S. District Court Judge James L. Robart rejected the NLRB’s motion to dismiss McConnell’s suit, ruling that the agency had misread a federal conflict-of-interest statute and that she had validly claimed that its action “places a significant burden on her First Amendment rights.” Although the judge ruled based on a standard that puts McConnell’s allegations in the best light, it seems likely that he’ll make the same findings on the merits given that the case presents few if any factual disputes.

“We welcome this ruling, which comes at a time when the rights of federal employees are under siege,” stated PEER Staff Counsel Colleen Zimmerman. “Federal workers do not surrender their rights to speak out as a condition of entering public service.”

In this case, the court relied on a prior case bought by PEER more than 20 years ago involving an electrical engineer from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based in Las Vegas who faced similar agency threats for his off-duty advocacy for desert tortoises. Today under the Trump administration, some federal employees have been fired or suspended for exercising their free speech rights. Currently, PEER is leading a legal challenge to the termination of several EPA employees because they signed a public letter of dissent.

“This case has broad implications for all federal employees and everyone in this country,” said PEER Senior Counsel Paula Dinerstein. “If the government prevails in this case, it will give license to the current administration to silence and intimidate public servants who want to engage in civic activities outside of their work.”

“I became a public servant because I care about the public good. Like all my fellow federal workers, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, and I won’t be intimidated from continuing to stand up for my constitutional rights and the rights of all federal employees,” McConnell said.

Hawai‘i is the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation. We rely on oil for about 65% of our electricity and spend billions of dollars annually on it.

This dependence has resulted in high electricity and transportation costs and exposure to supply and price volatility. This vulnerability underscores why clean energy should be framed as a fight for energy independence. Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Political scientist Jessica Green argues that climate politics is really a competition with trillions of dollars at stake. Fossil fuel asset owners are incentivized to delay the transition to protect their investments. Vulnerable asset owners face the consequences of climate change, e.g., property losses and higher insurance costs. Green asset owners are stakeholders whose assets gain value as the transition accelerates. We must consider these dynamics to accelerate progress.

Hawaiʻi already has many green asset owners. We have thousands of households with rooftop solar benefiting from reduced energy costs, owners of over 40,000 EVs on our roads converting gas to local electricity spending, and electric grids with 36% to 50% renewable energy. Importantly, electricians, installers, auditors, mechanics, engineers, and operators are also asset owners.

Our main fossil asset owner is Par Pacific, through its refinery and fuel distribution network. But it is already evolving, with part of the Kapolei refinery being converted to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines in 2026. This is what a practical transition looks like and an example of how fossil fuel assets can be repurposed while protecting our workforce and economic capacity and increasing energy independence.

Clearly, much more must be done to achieve our energy future. Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience. Each solution must perform its specific job well, prevent undesired consequences, and work with others so that the transition becomes self-reinforcing.

Here are a few priorities for our government and business leaders to consider in 2026:

Priority 1: Standardize and streamline permitting and modernize interconnection. This will speed up deployment of common projects (e.g., rooftop solar, EV chargers, batteries), prevent yearslong project delays for large grid-scale projects, and enable innovation in clean, firm power.

Priority 2: Scale green loans, rebates, and tax credits for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Incentivize the transition with close attention to our low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

Priority 3: Accelerate fleet electrification by deploying EV charging infrastructure and basing procurement on total cost of ownership, not just purchase price. This will ensure that our transportation goals are met and build general momentum for the transformation of our ground transportation system.

Priority 4: Fund workforce development programs to avoid worker capacity bottlenecks in clean tech, create career opportunities for our youth, and build economic resilience.

Priority 5: Create a carbon dividend program using our barrel tax. This would direct revenue to households, with additional support to those most exposed to energy price increases. This would protect households, provide businesses with certainty, and encourage investment in energy efficiency and clean transportation.

Priority 6: Publish a quarterly scorecard (with state, county, and utility inputs) to track progress on relevant metrics, e.g., rebate utilization, permit processing times, interconnection queue metrics, fleet and charger deployment, and household energy and fuel cost index.

Many of these changes can leverage federal grants, bonds and service-based delivery arrangements that don’t require upfront capital. Households and businesses can use PACE financing, solar leases, and community solar to convert capital expenditures into monthly energy and transportation costs at or below what they already pay.

We have a choice: the fossil asset corner, which means reliance on energy imports and vulnerability. Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi. The choice is clear.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/02/25135544/east-maui-windmills-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:51.227350

That is hospitality.” Reimagining hospitality at Texas A&M Texas is one of the fastest-growing states for travel, tourism and service-based industries, which made Goodwin a natural partner as the College expanded hospitality education.
Working with faculty and former students, Goodwin helped develop a plan that led to the creation of the Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in 2023.
“This is going to be the front door of Texas A&M,” Goodwin said.
“We are building something that will make Texas A&M the place to study hospitality, hotel management and tourism,” Goodwin said.","Drive through Aggieland, and you will see them everywhere: black and green signs that read “Oldham Goodwin.” They mark hotels, apartment communities and office buildings that have become staples in the community. Behind those signs is Hunter Goodwin ’96, a former Texas A&M University tight end whose second career as a real estate developer has kept him closely tied to the place that shaped him.

Goodwin’s company has helped fuel local growth, but his impact reaches much further. Through his support of the Arch H. Aplin III ’80 Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Goodwin is helping build opportunities for students who want to lead the next generation of the hospitality industry.

He sees it as an extension of what he learned at Texas A&M: Service and leadership go hand in hand.

“Hospitality is about people,” Goodwin said. “That is what Texas A&M taught me. You serve others, you lead with integrity, and you make a difference wherever you are.”

An Aggie foundation

Goodwin grew up in Bellville, a town small enough that Friday night football brought everyone together. When he arrived in College Station, the scale was bigger, but the sense of community felt the same.

“When I came to A&M, it just fit,” he said. “The people and the place felt right.”

He played football under Coach R.C. Slocum, learning lessons in discipline and teamwork that carried him through nine seasons in the NFL. Off the field, professors in the Department of Agricultural Economics showed him how to think about business through a human lens.

“I had professors like Dr. John Nichols and Dr. Ed Rister who didn’t just teach, they mentored,” Goodwin said. “Those relationships still matter to me today.”

However, it was a class with Ivan Schmederman ’67, Ph.D., that set his career in motion. A guest lecture by real estate broker John Schneider introduced him to the field, and something clicked. “I remember thinking: This is what I want to do,” he said.

Building opportunity

After the NFL, Goodwin returned to College Station with his wife, Amber ’97, to put down roots and start the next chapter. In 2004, he partnered with fellow Aggie Casey Oldham ’02 to form the Oldham Goodwin Group. What began as two people with an idea is now a company of more than 500 employees with projects across Texas.

“We wanted to create something that built opportunity for people,” Goodwin said. “If you drive around and see those black and green Oldham Goodwin signs, that is what they represent. They stand for growth and a belief in this community.”

The company’s work spans commercial, multifamily and hospitality properties, but at its core, Goodwin said, it is about service.

“Every project we take on affects people,” he said. “Our job is to create spaces where they can live, work or stay comfortably. That is hospitality.”

Reimagining hospitality at Texas A&M

Texas is one of the fastest-growing states for travel, tourism and service-based industries, which made Goodwin a natural partner as the College expanded hospitality education. Communities across the state need professionals who understand management, service and experience-based leadership.

“The idea was to build something that prepared students for the world they are stepping into,” Goodwin said.

Working with faculty and former students, Goodwin helped develop a plan that led to the creation of the Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in 2023. This reformulation of the Department of Recreation, Park and Tourism Sciences capitalized on its legacy while positioning the program to meet the growing needs of Texas.

“Hospitality fits naturally with who we are as Aggies,” Goodwin said. “We teach leadership and service, and that is what this industry is built on. It is about creating experiences that make people feel valued.”

The department’s new identity has sparked momentum. Enrollments have grown by about 30% to reach almost 500 over the past year, new degrees have launched, incorporating paid internships, and partnerships with industry leaders are giving students hands-on experience before they graduate.

“As Dr. John Crompton told me, our biggest challenge now is managing success,” Goodwin said. “That is a good challenge to have.”

A hub for hospitality innovation

In the fall of 2025, the department updated its name to officially become the Arch H. Aplin III ’80 Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism, in honor of Texas A&M former student and Buc-ee’s founder Arch H. “Beaver” Aplin III ’80, whose gift is helping advance hospitality education at Texas A&M.

The department’s rapid growth will soon take center stage at the new Aplin Center, made possible through a gift from Aplin. The facility will serve as both a hospitality teaching hub and the university’s official visitor center.

“This is going to be the front door of Texas A&M,” Goodwin said. “It is where people will experience who we are before they see anything else.”

The Aplin Center will feature teaching kitchens, event and retail spaces and learning labs where students will connect classroom knowledge to real-world operations. For Goodwin, it represents what hospitality is all about.

“When people think of agriculture, they often think of crops or cattle,” he said. “But hospitality is agriculture too. It is about food service and connecting people. It is about caring for others.”

Goodwin continues to work closely with department head Brian King, Ph.D., to develop industry partnerships and expand student opportunities.

“We are building something that will make Texas A&M the place to study hospitality, hotel management and tourism,” Goodwin said. “And it is happening in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.”

Leading by example

Even as his company grows, Goodwin’s priorities have stayed the same. He believes in showing up, giving back and setting the tone for others to follow.

“I was raised to believe that if you have been blessed, you give back,” he said. “Time is the one thing we all have the same amount of and giving it to others is the best thing you can do.”

He mentors students and young professionals across the College, encouraging them to combine knowledge with purpose.

“You do not have to be the loudest voice in the room,” he said. “You just have to be the one people can count on.”

Those same lessons drive his team at Oldham Goodwin.

“When we manage a hotel or develop a property, our goal is simple,” he said. “We want to make someone’s day better. That is hospitality, but it is also the Aggie way.”

Carrying the tradition forward

For Goodwin, the Aplin Department of Hospitality captures the best of Texas A&M: tradition, service and the drive to do meaningful work.

“Hospitality is about creating moments that matter,” he said. “It is about making people feel seen and valued. That is what Aggies do.”

Through his company and his continued involvement with the College, Goodwin is helping shape a department that develops both skill and character.

“Our graduates will go out and lead in every corner of this industry,” he said. “They will make people proud to say they learned it here.”

So, those black and green signs are about more than just business. They represent a story of service, community and a belief that tradition is something you build, not just inherit.

“Texas A&M shaped who I am,” Goodwin said. “Now it is my turn to give back and make sure the next generation has the same chance. That is what this place does. It builds people who build the world.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2026/01/20251121_Hunter_Goodwin_MM_170.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:41.546836

Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.
Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers.
GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution.
And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.","Ford Motor Co.’s staggering $19.5 billion write-down of its massive electric vehicle investment is a stark illustration of how difficult it’s become for state governments to pick winning companies and technologies.

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies. And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.

But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.

In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.

But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.

Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.

The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.

Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.

Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.

Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.

Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.

GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.

On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.

Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the

Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.

President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”

But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”

Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.

Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant. Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.

There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.

Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.

The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.

“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0384-2-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:13.505140

First reported by Automotive News, the license is valid through Oct. 31, clearing the way for Scout to sell its electric vehicles in the state.

Cody Thacker, vice president of commercial operations at Scout Motors, emphasized the benefits for consumers and the company’s commitment to the state.

“Scout Motors would like to thank the Colorado Auto Industry Division and the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board for conducting their due diligence on our dealer license application and affirming our legal right to sell vehicles under Colorado law,” Thacker said in an email statement to The Post.

“This direct sales model allows us to lower costs for consumers, provide greater price transparency, deliver a faster and more convenient transaction process, and establish one-to-one relationships with customers.”

Founded in September 2022, Thacker said Scout Motors is an independent American company, building everything from the ground up.

While an independent company, Scout Motors is backed by Volkswagen AG, a publicly traded German company, making it a member of the Volkswagen Group.

The Scout, originally produced by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980, stakes its claim as the world’s first utility vehicle.

The Volkswagen Group acquired the trademark for the Scout brand in 2021 through its purchase of Navistar, which was created in 1986 when International Harvester reorganized its truck division.

The license approval also marks a milestone for Scout’s vehicle model launch plans. Beginning in 2027, Scout plans to start production of its Traveler SUV and Terra truck.

Scout vehicles will be engineered in Detroit and built in South Carolina, drawing on the manufacturing and production expertise of the Volkswagen Group.

Both models will be offered with either a fully electric power source delivering an estimated range of up to 350 miles, or an available gas-powered range extender that recharges the battery and enables more than 500 miles of total range.

Entry-level pricing for both models is expected to start under $60,000.

Kyle Boyd, communications manager for the Colorado Department of Revenue, confirmed with The Post that the license allows Scout to sell new, used and wholesale motor vehicles.

The Motor Vehicle Dealer Board consists of nine members, including three motor vehicle dealers, three used vehicle dealers and three public members. The Division Director and Executive Secretary of the Board, John Opeka, was not available for comment.

Colorado dealers quickly criticized the move, saying it was an attempt to sidestep laws that keep automakers out of retail sales. Volkswagen dealers have also filed lawsuits in the past to block Scout’s direct-sales plans in other states.

“Ultimately, we are disappointed in the outcome of the licensing action,” said Colorado Automobile Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves.

“But it is only the first step in this journey. Our industry will look to preserve justice and protect our franchise law through every available means.”

In March 2020, Gov. Jared Polis signed a law amending the state’s dealer statute to allow vehicle manufacturers to own, operate and control dealerships in Colorado only if they make exclusively electric vehicles and do not have any franchised dealers of the same line-make.

The board determined that Scout Motors is not the same “line-make” as Volkswagen, Audi, or Porsche, a legal distinction that allowed the approval despite Volkswagen’s financial backing, according to GM Authority.

Despite the opposition, Thacker said Scout Motors is committed to its customers and “will not be intimidated out of doing what is right for them.”

“Despite repeated attempts by dealer lobbyists to unfairly prevent Colorado consumers from choosing how they want to buy cars, this decisive approval by the Dealer Board ensures that we can continue moving forward with our business plans to invest in Colorado, employ Colorado workers and deliver a modern, customer-focused experience for thousands of future Scout owners in the state,” he said.

Scout plans to open retail stores in 16 metro areas, with a long-term goal of expanding to roughly 100 locations across the U.S. and Canada by 2032, according to its website.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Scout-EV_Group_0748_wide.jpg?w=1024&h=576,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:17.859569

The Nuclear Energy Institute represents the commercial nuclear technologies industry. Its mission is to ensure nuclear energy continues to grow as a reliable, affordable, carbon-­free backbone of the U.S. electric grid. To that end, we at NEI track all state legislation, executive orders, regulatory proceedings, and other state conversations on behalf of our members—translating policy and discussions into clear, actional guidance for governors, legislators, and utility regulators. NEI serves as a trusted partner to state leaders, offering policy models, technical expertise, and regulatory pathways that help states move from interest to implementation. We work side by side with our members to help state leaders make informed decisions about nuclear’s role in a state’s energy mix. Here are some of the highlights from the past year.

States leading the way in 2025

These states took big strides in 2025 to signal support and clear pathways for nuclear development.

Indiana has proactively shown support for nuclear during the past several years, with Gov. Mike Braun and the state legislature adopting a variety of policies to attract new nuclear business to the state. The legislature passed multiple bills this session, creating a small modular reactor partnership pilot program, authorizing cost recovery for preconstruction expenses on new nuclear projects, and providing a 20 percent tax credit to support SMR manufacturing.

North Carolina enacted a bill that expands the state’s Construction Work in Progress (CWIP), allowing a utility to collect financing costs for a project before construction is completed. This mechanism reduces the cost to finance a project and may lower the total project costs that eventually are included in the customer rate base.

Tennessee’s state leaders, led by Gov. Bill Lee, have strongly backed nuclear energy as a centerpiece of their long-­term energy and economic strategy. The 2025 budget earmarked $50 million to the Tennessee Valley Authority to assist in accelerating construction of SMRs and $10 million toward workforce development. Lee also formally designated the East Tennessee Economic Council’s long-­standing nuclear working group as the Tennessee Nuclear Network (TN²), a statewide official partnership for advancing nuclear innovation, workforce development, and economic opportunities.

Texas also had a big year, where the state legislature—which uniquely only meets every other year—authorized $350 million to support nuclear projects and established the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office to serve as a single point of contact for nuclear project developers navigating state and local permitting processes. Additional legislation supports permitting processes for uranium mining operations and creates an advanced nuclear energy workforce program.

Utah’s legislative and executive branches continue to work in tandem. In 2025, the legislature established a nuclear energy consortium and state energy council to advise on development and used fuel, while Gov. Spencer Cox signed several new partnerships, including a regional energy compact with Idaho and Wyoming.

Virginia’s public service commission approved up to $122 million in cost recovery for Appalachian Power to pursue site evaluation and SMR development. Additionally, the Virginia Nuclear Energy Consortium released its five-­year strategic plan for 2025–2029, which aims to accelerate the deployment of SMRs, strengthen the nuclear workforce, expand the nuclear supply chain, and develop a research and education reactor facility through the Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub.

Executive momentum

In these states, governors have signed executive orders, issued public statements, or announced projects that support feasibility studies or the deployment of new reactors.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed an executive order creating the Arizona Energy Promise Task Force, which is charged with studying, coordinating, and advancing key energy-­related policies, including a focus on advanced nuclear generation.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order establishing the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force. Since then, the state has published an Advanced Nuclear Strategic Framework and, most recently, has issued a request for information seeking industry input on site selection factors to identify ways the state can attract nuclear energy investment.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey announced a partnership with the University of Massachusetts–Lowell to launch the Massachusetts Roadmap for Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy, which outlines a statewide strategy to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion technologies by touching on policy, infrastructure, workforce development, and public engagement.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) this past summer to develop and construct at least 1 GW of advanced nuclear capacity to support the state’s grid. The state is also realizing the critical importance of its existing fleet. As part of an open docket before the public service commission, the Department of Public Service staff released a report calling for a 20-­year extension of New York’s zero-­emission credit program.

Utah Gov. Cox’s Operation Gigawatt, launched in 2024 with the goal of doubling the state’s power production over the next 10 years, continues to lead the state forward on nuclear. In late November, Utah announced a landmark partnership to build a combined nuclear manufacturing, training, and reactor deployment hub in Brigham City.

Moratorium movement

Some states historically have had specific restrictions on the books about the construction of new nuclear power facilities. Momentum to remove these outdated prohibitions has grown in recent years, with Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Wisconsin repealing their moratoriums. That momentum continued in 2025 with several more states removing these bans to make way for additional opportunities for nuclear.

Connecticut repealed its moratorium on nuclear, allowing municipalities to opt in to hosting advanced nuclear through a local vote.

Illinois repealed its 300-­MW reactor size limit on new reactors.

Rhode Island is allowing utilities to procure nuclear power and enter into long-­term nuclear contracts. These actions serve as an exception to the state’s moratorium against nuclear.

Grid aligned

These states are developing the regulatory, financial, and institutional infrastructure needed to support new nuclear deployment.

Arizona’s corporation commission is actively holding workshops to educate stakeholders and the public on advanced nuclear. Additionally, Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project, and Tucson Electric Power announced a partnership to explore new nuclear capacity in the state, including evaluating potential sites for new nuclear facilities, including SMRs and large reactors.

Kentucky has directed its public service commission to develop a siting process for new nuclear facilities, hold public hearings, and survey other states on regulatory qualifications and compensation. The state is planning a multiday conference in the coming year to discuss nuclear deployment with interested stakeholders.

New Jersey’s board of public utilities issued a request for information on deploying new nuclear, and the legislature introduced a bill that establishes a state-­backed incentive program to develop 1.2 GW of nuclear capacity.

Laying the groundwork

These states are evaluating where and how advanced reactors could be sited and deployed.

Studying: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin each have initiated feasibility studies, while Florida’s public service commission completed its own technical and economic assessment last year. Nebraska is moving into the second phase of its statewide study, narrowing 16 potential communities down to three or four possible sites for new nuclear deployment.

Collaborating: Delaware and Hawaii established feasibility-­focused task forces and working groups, while Maryland’s public service commission convened a working group to examine the implementation of its nuclear procurement program.

Defining as clean: Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and New Hampshire join other states in expanding the definition of clean energy to specifically include nuclear.

Multistate collaboration

National associations of state policymakers are showing more interest than ever before in nuclear energy. These organizations represent various state stakeholders that are dedicating funding and resources to enable state officials to explore policies to support nuclear and share best practices between states.

The Council of State Governments Midwestern Legislative Conference, which represents all three branches of government in 11 Midwest states and four Canadian provinces, passed a resolution in support of new nuclear development.

The National Association of State Energy Officials formed an 11-­state collaborative to support first movers in new nuclear and accelerate advanced reactor projects by working with the private sector, the U.S. Department of Energy, and Congress. NASEO also issued a request for information to identify opportunities for states to collaborate and support the formation of an order book for new nuclear, which would help drive down costs associated with first-­of-­a-­kind projects.

The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners passed its first resolution in direct support of nuclear, enabling it and state regulators to weigh in with supportive language on a variety of nuclear-­related topics.

The National Governors Association launched an initiative to explore ways to support nuclear development in states interested in nuclear energy policy. NGA has provided two-­day, in-­state nuclear convenings in six states and a regional New England partnership to explore nuclear’s role in each state’s energy planning.

The Western Governors’ Association unveiled its 2025–2026 Chair Initiative, led by Utah Gov. Cox—a yearlong endeavor exploring nuclear and other energy opportunities in the West.

More state activity

In addition to Iowa’s potential restart of Duane Arnold Energy Center, Pennsylvania is on track to reopen Crane Clean Energy Center (formally Three Mile Island-­1) by 2027—a development supported by a 20-­year power purchase agreement with Microsoft. Moreover, Palisades in Michigan has officially changed from decommissioning to operating status. State support and various state and local approvals are required to bring these plants back on line.

As states confront rising electricity demand driven by data centers, domestic manufacturing, and broad electrification efforts, nuclear energy has become a practical necessity. The bipartisan surge of support for nuclear power shows that states understand what’s at stake: reliable, affordable, carbon-­free energy that offers economic growth for states and communities for decades. It’s clear that 2026 is shaping up to be another pivotal year for nuclear energy. State policymakers and regulators are laying the groundwork needed to turn broad conversations into actionable projects. States that commit to that path now will shape America’s energy landscape for generations.

Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.
Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers.
GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution.
And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.","Ford Motor Co.’s staggering $19.5 billion write-down of its massive electric vehicle investment is a stark illustration of how difficult it’s become for state governments to pick winning companies and technologies.

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies. And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.

But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.

In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.

But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.

Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.

The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.

Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.

Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.

Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.

Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.

GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.

On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.

Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the

Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.

President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”

But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”

Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.

Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant. Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.

There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.

Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.

The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.

“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dsc_0384-2-1024x6831768226633.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=hlDtqQP-,N,,2026-01-12 09:58:41.563718

She is asking the court to declare the stop-work orders unlawful and block their enforcement.","In December 2025, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) abruptly issued stop-work orders to the New York-based Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind projects, directing them to immediately suspend all construction due to undisclosed “national security” concerns.

Attorney General James argues that these orders are arbitrary and unwarranted, as both projects underwent years of extensive national security and safety reviews, and pausing these projects could threaten New York’s economy and energy grid. She is asking the court to intervene to block the administration’s stop-work orders.

“These projects were carefully reviewed and already under construction when the federal government pulled the plug without explanation. This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk, and my office is taking action to stop it,” said the Attorney General.

“New York will not back down in our fight for clean energy and I commend Attorney General James for taking this action to lift the unlawful stop-work orders on New York’s two offshore wind projects under construction,” said Governor Kathy Hochul.

“The Trump administration’s incomprehensible obsession with shutting down these fully permitted projects lacks legal justification, hurts his stated goal of US energy independence, and will cost New York thousands of jobs and needed power to keep the lights on and attract economic development opportunities. These unlawful actions cannot stand.”

Attorney General James argues that the stop-work orders will have immediate and severe consequences, including significant economic harm throughout New York. Together, the projects support thousands of union jobs, billions of dollars in private and public investment, and major infrastructure improvements in communities across Long Island and New York City. Halting construction risks delaying or permanently derailing the projects, jeopardising contracts, local tax revenue, workforce training programmes, and long-term economic development tied to New York’s clean energy transition.

Attorney General James also asserts that the administration’s actions will harm New Yorkers’ health and wallets. Delaying or derailing these clean-energy projects would prolong New York City and Long Island’s reliance on the region’s decades-old fossil-fuel plants, which send significant pollution into communities and result in higher energy costs for consumers. The delay would also threaten the state’s ability to meet its legally mandated clean-energy targets, including achieving 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and a zero-emissions electric grid by 2040.

In her lawsuits, filed simultaneously in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Attorney General James argues that the stop-work orders fail to explain the federal government’s change in position and to provide a genuine justification for the suspension, making them arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.

Unfortunately, this product may no longer be available to Missouri family farmers due to frivolous lawsuits.
Simply put, without access to these crop protection tools, food prices skyrocket, consumers suffer, global competitors gain market share, and Missouri family farms go out of business.
The Missouri Soybean Association (MSA) agrees with President Trump and the Solicitor General that federal law preempts these egregious lawsuits.","Is a Pro-Ag State like Missouri really going to side with the World Health Organization over the Trump administration, family farmers, and actual science?

If I had to guess, nearly all 197 lawmakers heading to Jefferson City for legislative session would agree with this statement: We need to protect and bolster Missouri’s family farms and the farm economy. There are many different policies to consider and ways to tackle this. But what would be one of the most impactful today, from the family farmer’s perspective? The Missouri legislature needs to close the legal loophole concerning critical pesticide technologies.

If you’re not familiar with the issue, it’s politically known around the Capitol as the “failure-to-warn” bill, centered around a widely used pesticide called glyphosate, or Roundup, manufactured by the St. Louis business, Bayer Crop Science.

To sell this product, the product manufacturer must register the product through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If the product is deemed to be safe for use through the registration process, the agency issues a federal label to be placed on the product that gives direct instruction on its use. Manufacturers are not legally allowed to deviate from the EPA approved label. But what is occurring is companies are following federal law appropriately and are being sued for doing so.

The World Health Organization (WHO)—through their cancer research arm known as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)—deemed this product to be “probably carcinogenic to humans.” It should be noted IARC classified it as a “Group 2A,” which is a list of what they deem to be “probable carcinogens” and includes the consumption of red meat, hot beverages like coffee, and being a hairdresser.

Regardless, this finding is contrary to the EPA’s finding, along with nearly all other regulatory bodies around the globe. On their official website the EPA states, “EPA considered a significantly more extensive and relevant dataset than the International Agency on the Research for Cancer (IARC).” In February of 2020, they again found there are no risks of concern to human health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label.

So, what’s the issue? Plaintiffs claimed they were harmed by their use of this product and are using IARCs finding as the basis of their claim. Some courts and juries, be it a minority as more cases have been won by product manufacturers than lost, are awarding major payouts since the product manufacturer “failed to warn” that the product might cause cancer.

So why don’t the companies just place a label on the product saying, “This product might cause cancer?” Because the EPA will not approve a label with unscientific claims like that, thus causing a de facto ban on farmers having access to the technology. This was evidenced when EPA issued a letter in 2019 stating they would not approve a label for a glyphosate with a warning on it. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California issued a preliminary injunction enjoining California from enforcing the state warning requirements involving glyphosate’s carcinogenicity, based on the fact the required warning statement is false and misleading.

The time is now to enact common sense measures that protect Missouri farm families having access to these critical technologies. Farmers have relied on glyphosate for weed control since 1974, and for the past few decades’ glyphosate has played an integral role in regenerative agriculture and conservation practices. The use of effective herbicides like glyphosate allows producers to adequately control yield-compromising weed pressure, vastly decrease carbon emissions, all while preventing erosion and enhancing overall soil health. Unfortunately, this product may no longer be available to Missouri family farmers due to frivolous lawsuits. Simply put, without access to these crop protection tools, food prices skyrocket, consumers suffer, global competitors gain market share, and Missouri family farms go out of business.

The Missouri Soybean Association (MSA) agrees with President Trump and the Solicitor General that federal law preempts these egregious lawsuits. Missouri lawmakers need to close this legal loophole and stop the increased costs on farmer inputs for an extensively tested and viable product.

Fusion energy can provide the large amounts of reliable, emissions-free power that advanced AI systems require.","The global shift toward electrification is placing unprecedented strain on power systems, with electricity demand rising faster than they can accommodate.

Advances in fusion technology, combined with growing public and private investment, suggest fusion could evolve into a scalable, zero-carbon baseload energy source.

To meet the energy needs of tomorrow, technology must be scaled up, grids upgraded and access to innovation developed.

We are entering the “Age of Electricity,” according to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2025. As advanced and emerging economies make that shift, the world will experience an unprecedented 40% surge in electricity demand in less than a decade.

The biggest drivers are unsurprising: the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) along with the related buildout of data centres carry an enormous appetite for power. In the United States alone, data centres may require more than 100 gigawatts of new capacity, with similar pressures mounting in Europe, India, China and the Middle East.

But the challenge is bigger than that.

Industrial reshoring, widespread electrification and rising heating and cooling loads driven by extreme weather are placing new upward pressure on energy demand, weakening the long-standing relationship between economic growth and declining energy intensity.

Global investment in power generation has raced to about $1 trillion per year since 2015, while grid spending lags at roughly $400 billion, producing congestion, curtailment and interconnection delays.

In the United States, critical data centre projects are being held back by 2 to 6 years, compounded by shortages of transformers and switchgear. Efficiency helps but AI‑optimized servers draw two to four times the power of traditional servers.

How fusion could fulfil clean energy needs

We are entering a new industrial age where today’s breakthroughs require more clean, reliable power than any period in modern history.

The development of energy technology will determine how far and fast a power transformation can go. Scalable, clean baseload power underpins all infrastructure, from data centres to supply chains and without an abundant and resilient energy source, progress will stall.

Fusion energy could change that.

Fusion is the energy source that powers the stars. It has the potential to provide the energy needs of modern cities and industries without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. This positions fusion as a potential backbone of global digital infrastructure.

According to the Max Planck Institute, fusion energy power plants will supply power similar to that of present-day large-scale power stations powered by coal but with vastly different amounts of fuel needed.

One gram of fusion fuel could provide 90,000 kilowatt-hours of energy in a power plant, comparable to the combustion heat generated by 11 tons of coal.

Fusion power plants are also designed to be inherently safe, without the risks of runaway reactions, meltdowns or high-level, long-lived radioactive waste. It also avoids the regulatory red tape of traditional nuclear fission. Fusion energy can be sited and scaled to provide primary energy wherever and whenever it is needed.

It also avoids the regulatory red tape of traditional nuclear fission. Fusion energy can be sited and scaled to provide primary energy wherever and whenever it is needed.

For science and manufacturing, abundant energy to accelerate computation power shortens development cycles and expands what’s possible.

Why fusion would rebalance energy security

For the first time, shifting to fusion could allow us to build technology that produces energy rather than relying on finite resource consumption.

This unlocks a new class of economic opportunity, from high-value manufacturing and advanced materials to resilient domestic power for AI, data centres, and energy-intensive industries, while establishing a fundamentally new paradigm for energy security.

If fusion energy is deployed at scale and countries achieve energy independence, energy supply would also evade geopolitical tensions that has allowed states to weaponize energy resources. Global markets would, therefore, become far less vulnerable to the energy-driven price shocks and inflationary pressures that have historically followed armed conflicts.

Global markets would, therefore, become far less vulnerable to the energy-driven price shocks and inflationary pressures that have historically followed armed conflicts.

Advancements in fusion energy development

Technology innovations in fusion, recently driven largely by the private sector, will make it possible for this new energy source to become a baseload resource capable of stablizing grids, enable electrified industries and support mission-critical power.

A site in Virginia for the world’s first grid-scale commercial fusion power plant is now zoned specifically for a fusion power plant, with permitting and construction as the next steps toward putting electricity onto the grid by the early 2030s.

Leaders around the world are also working to accelerate deployment, with the United States establishing an Office of Fusion to make it a clear priority. China is also investing billions in their capabilities, Germany developing a funding programme for startups and several countries around the world, from the United Kingdom to Japan, adopting regulatory frameworks to provide certainty to developers.

Fusion energy can provide the large amounts of reliable, emissions-free power that advanced AI systems require. In turn, AI can accelerate the design, operation and commercialization of fusion itself. This creates a first-of-its-kind symbiotic relationship: a self-reinforcing cycle in which fusion enables AI and AI accelerates fusion’s path to scale.

Together, this emerging AI-fusion nexus has the potential to reshape industrial systems, strengthen energy security and open new manufacturing and scientific frontiers, rather than merely meeting today’s energy demands.

What can help accelerate fusion deployment?

Sustained economic growth will increasingly depend on investments in advanced energy systems, including the development and deployment of commercial fusion and on integrating these systems with AI, industrial and manufacturing ecosystems.

Regulatory and policy frameworks that support scaling and attract private-sector capital will be important enablers of this process.

Many countries are beginning to develop strategies that align technological innovation with energy and security priorities, bringing these considerations into a more coordinated policy framework.

Decisions made in the coming years, such as where to site data centres, how to modernize power grids and expand transmission and how to secure supply chains for advanced materials, will influence the reliability, affordability and resilience of future energy systems, as well as their capacity to support economic activity and national security objectives.

The overarching objectives are greater resilience, productivity and strategic autonomy. Building domestic capabilities across the fusion value chain can contribute to these goals and shape longer-term leadership in energy and related technologies.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_rE9QIQCe4s-cpLj_ZwX6MY3rF_qUfj3nitNajltBNP8.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:03.875169

Trump’s memo did not specify whether or not his administration will submit a formal notice of termination to the UN.
But in Koh’s view, congressional silence should not be interpreted as consent to exit the treaty.
Rhode Island senator and climate hawk Sheldon Whitehouse also said Trump’s withdrawal is “not just corrupt, it’s illegal”.
“Climate action won’t stop because of the latest US treaty withdrawal, either in the US or globally.","The Trump administration’s long-anticipated decision this week to pull the US from the world’s most important climate treaty may have been illegal, some experts say.

“In my legal opinion, he does not have the authority,” Harold Hongju Koh, former head lawyer for the US state department, told the Guardian.

In a Wednesday presidential memorandum, the president said the US “shall withdraw” from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions that it deemed “contrary to the interests of the United States”. It marks the first time any country has ever moved to exit the agreement.

The UN climate body requires one year’s notice for withdrawal, so the United States will not cease being a party for a year. Trump’s memo did not specify whether or not his administration will submit a formal notice of termination to the UN.

Reached for comment, a state department spokesperson noted that Trump’s memo said the agency will take all necessary “steps to effectuate the withdrawal of the United States from the organizations as soon as possible”. The person also referred the Guardian to secretary of state Marco Rubio’s Wednesday statement, where he said the Trump administration is exiting institutions and treaties which it believes to be “redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity”.

Because the country entered the UNFCCC with the consultation and approval of the Senate in 1992, “there is an open question” about whether or not the president can unilaterally exit the agreement, Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University, wrote in an email.

The UNFCCC and the Paris climate agreement – the landmark 2015 climate pact underpinned by the UNFCCC, from which Trump pulled the US last January – both say that parties may withdraw with one year’s written notice. But unlike the UNFCCC, the Paris agreement was never ratified by the US Senate, Gerrard noted.

“President Obama took the position that since the Paris agreement did not impose binding legal obligations on the US, it was not a treaty that required Senate ratification,” he said. “In contrast, President George HW Bush submitted the UNFCCC to the Senate, which unanimously ratified it in 1992, and he then signed it.”

Some scholars argue that the president has the ability to unilaterally end treaties – if not legally, then practically, because Congress has previously acquiesced to the executive branch.

“In practice, presidents have long asserted the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties and other international agreements without seeking the approval of either the Senate or Congress,” said Curtis Bradley, a University of Chicago law school professor and former counselor of international law at the state department.

But in Koh’s view, congressional silence should not be interpreted as consent to exit the treaty. A “mirror principle” should dictate that the same amount of congressional input needed to enter into a treaty should be required to withdraw from it, said Koh, now an international legal expert at Yale University.

“If I had an agreement that I made by myself, it would make sense that I could leave by myself,” he said. “But if my wife and I made an agreement that both of us had to sign, could I withdraw from it by myself? I believe we would both have to withdraw.” He said he expects groups to sue the administration over its memo.

Rhode Island senator and climate hawk Sheldon Whitehouse also said Trump’s withdrawal is “not just corrupt, it’s illegal”.

“This polluter-driven stoogery shows the full extent of creepy polluters’ control over the Trump administration. Trump’s corrupt fossil-fuel interests threaten the wellbeing of millions around the world on the frontlines of climate disaster, defy the will of the American people, and damage US economic competitiveness,” he said in a statement, adding that he believes “once the Senate has ratified a treaty, only the Senate can withdraw from the treaty”.

The US constitution does not explicitly spell out such a mirror principle, only stating that the president “shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur”.

The supreme court has also never ruled on the topic: though it took up the issue of treaty exit in 1979 when then president Jimmy Carter withdrew from a treaty establishing diplomatic relations with China, the justices “splintered and didn’t come to a single rationale” on which US governmental branch can exit treaties, and under what circumstances, said Koh.

Jean Galbraith, an international law expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey law school, said the issue of unilateral withdrawal is “hard” and “complex”. Even when the Senate recommends entry into treaties, she said, the president has the discretion not to take their advice.

“When you think about withdrawal, you can think about, what exactly is the president doing? Are they just ratcheting back that last step of ratification,” she asked. “Maybe the president would say, ‘I’m just pulling back the instrument of ratification.’ Maybe the president would say, ‘I have the power to do this withdrawal unilaterally, at least as far as I don’t have anything from the Senate or Congress telling me explicitly that I don’t have that power.’”

Experts also disagree on what it would take for the US to re-enter the UNFCCC. Some experts believe that Trump’s exit nullifies the 1992 Senate vote in support of joining.

“My own view is that a president would need to obtain a new approval,” said Bradley. “The US constitution requires senatorial approval for joining treaties but does not clearly require senatorial approval for leaving treaties.”

That would mean the process of reentry would require a future president to secure the support of two-thirds of the Senate to agree to re-enter the treaty, which would be difficult to obtain in the contemporary political climate.

Galbraith, however, believes the two-thirds Senate vote from 1992 remains in effect.

Others, including Galbraith, believe that if Trump can unilaterally exit a treaty, a future president could rejoin it without a new two-thirds Senate vote.

“You still have that on the books,” she said.

Sue Biniaz, former principal deputy special envoy for climate at the state department, shares that perspective.

“Climate action won’t stop because of the latest US treaty withdrawal, either in the US or globally. And the federal retreat is, hopefully, a temporary one. There are multiple future pathways to rejoining the key climate agreements,” she said, adding that she specifically agrees that the US could “rather seamlessly rejoin the UNFCCC based on the Senate’s approval in 1992”.

Trump’s exit from the UNFCCC indicates to the rest of the world that the US is “an unreliable partner for long term commitments”, said Galbraith.

“It’s a further signal of real antipathy to fixing what is a real and increasingly dire problem,” she said.

The withdrawal from the agreement came on the one-year anniversary of devastating fires in Los Angeles, and days after the shocking capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, after which the president outlined a vision of the US boosting fossil fuel extraction from the South American country.

“Trump’s contempt for international efforts to build peace and solidarity continues to shred the nation’s international credibility and will cause irreparable damage to current and future generations both at home and abroad,” said Melinda St Louis, director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch. “As climate harms escalate, choosing withdrawal is a shortsighted, profoundly irresponsible retreat from international leadership when it is needed more than ever.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635db193737a1a92708152706b2976acbe30373d/358_0_3583_2867/master/3583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2148431d6c260fa6a62ad9439e10181",N,,2026-01-12 09:13:10.589670

President Trump remains controversial among auto consumers, with only 28 percent rating him a friend of the U.S. auto industry

DETROIT, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As President Donald Trump prepares to travel to Detroit this week to address the Detroit Economic Club and tour a Ford Motor Co. plant during the opening of the North American International Auto Show, new national research from EVs for All America finds that Americans' views on electric vehicles are evolving, with Republican resistance easing but concerns about jobs, China and affordability still shaping the market.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" said EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The report, Fixing America's Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress, analyzes three years of national polling of U.S. auto consumers and finds positive movement among Republicans, strong partisan polarization over Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and a clear road map to sell more EVs across America.

Key findings from the new report include:

Republican hostility toward EVs has lessened by 20 points over three years.

GOP voters are increasingly less likely to say EVs are ""for people who see the world differently,"" signaling a gradual thaw in cultural resistance.

President Trump faces significant doubts among consumers about his support for the U.S. auto industry. Only 28 percent of auto consumer voters in households earning $50,000 or more rate President Trump as a ""Friend of the U.S. Auto Industry."" The sample represents more than 80 percent of the new- and used-vehicle market and roughly two-thirds of the presidential-year electorate.

Opinions of Elon Musk are sharply divided along party lines.

While Republicans give Musk favorable ratings (which has helped thaw GOP consumers' hostility to EVs), Democrats overwhelmingly hold strongly unfavorable views at 86 percent, creating a significant branding problem for Tesla.

Republican voters are deeply concerned about the loss of auto manufacturing jobs to China.

The majority of Republican voters worry that U.S. national security is at risk if America's industrial base continues to erode with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China. 88 percent worry at least some, including 53 percent who worry a lot.

The loss of federal EV subsidies cools consumer interest.

Roughly half of auto consumers say the end of federal EV incentives makes them less likely to buy or lease an electric vehicle. Conversely, an examination of EV sales in Germany after EV subsidies ended shows a strong recovery over the two years since the credits ended, following an initial sales decline.

Multifamily building residents remain a significant opportunity for increased EV sales if overnight ""Level 2"" charging is added to apartment buildings and condo parking.

65 percent of condo owners and 70 percent of apartment renters say they would be more likely to buy or lease an EV if their building offered overnight Level 2 charging in parking spaces. The finding highlights a major adoption barrier for urban and suburban consumers who lack access to private garages.

Consumers clearly report that the best path to selling more EVs, both in red states and blue, involves moving marketing messages away from ""green"" messaging and instead focusing on the many positive vehicle attributes that EV drivers enjoy, including fast, fun to drive, quiet, and the ability to avoid traditional and expensive gas stations.

The data show that consumers under 45 are far more open to EVs than older consumers, a trend that should grow as younger consumers age and gain market share. In a troubling long-term sign for existing auto brands in the U.S., younger consumers under 45 show a definite open-mindedness to purchasing Chinese-made vehicles, while consumers over 55 are far more hostile.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" said Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs. Since 80 percent of all EVs sold in America are sold in 15 states, smart pro-EV policy in those core states is the best public policy move in the short term. Opinions of EVs are always higher in states with a large EV market penetration since our data shows positive word of mouth is a huge factor in attracting more EV customers.""

Murphy said the findings offer timely context as national political leaders spotlight manufacturing and the auto industry.

""With the President heading to Detroit to talk about jobs and American manufacturing, this research underscores that EVs are an important path to creating more American auto jobs and helping secure U.S. auto manufacturing, not targets of a culture war,"" Murphy said. ""That only helps China seize the future of the global auto industry, a real threat to the U.S. and our allies. Automotive and political leaders should take our findings on younger consumers' interest in Chinese-made cars seriously as well.""

The report is based on annual national surveys of 600 registered voters age 18 and older in households earning $50,000 or more, representing more than 80 percent of the U.S. new- and used-vehicle market. EVs for All America conducted these surveys each November from 2023 through 2025. The report also incorporates additional research, including an October 2024 survey of 800 registered Republicans and an October 2025 survey of 400 California condo and apartment residents. National polling was conducted by Hill Research Consultants, with the California survey conducted by David Binder and Associates.

Reliance Industries affirms its battery storage manufacturing plans are on track. The company denies reports of pausing lithium-ion cell production in India. Discussions for Chinese technology licensing have reportedly stalled. Reliance continues to build a world-leading battery storage ecosystem.

India's Reliance Industries said ‍on Monday that its plans for battery storage manufacturing remain ⁠unchanged, following a Bloomberg News report that said the conglomerate had paused plans to make lithium-ion battery cells in India ‌after failing ‌to secure Chinese technology.

""Reliance Industries strongly and categorically affirms ‌that there has been no change in our plans for creating a world leading battery storage manufacturing ecosystem from Cell to containerised ESS (energy storage system) and that they ​are progressing well in line ​with our target timelines,"" a company spokesperson said in ‌an ‍email to Reuters.

The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate, ‍which aimed to start manufacturing cells this year, ‌had been in discussions with Chinese firm Xiamen Hithium Energy Storage Technology to license cell technology, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing people who did not want to be identified.

President Trump remains controversial among auto consumers, with only 28 percent rating him a friend of the U.S. auto industry

DETROIT, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As President Donald Trump prepares to travel to Detroit this week to address the Detroit Economic Club and tour a Ford Motor Co. plant during the opening of the North American International Auto Show, new national research from EVs for All America finds that Americans' views on electric vehicles are evolving, with Republican resistance easing but concerns about jobs, China and affordability still shaping the market.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" said EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The report, Fixing America's Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress, analyzes three years of national polling of U.S. auto consumers and finds positive movement among Republicans, strong partisan polarization over Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and a clear road map to sell more EVs across America.

Key findings from the new report include:

Republican hostility toward EVs has lessened by 20 points over three years.

GOP voters are increasingly less likely to say EVs are ""for people who see the world differently,"" signaling a gradual thaw in cultural resistance.

President Trump faces significant doubts among consumers about his support for the U.S. auto industry. Only 28 percent of auto consumer voters in households earning $50,000 or more rate President Trump as a ""Friend of the U.S. Auto Industry."" The sample represents more than 80 percent of the new- and used-vehicle market and roughly two-thirds of the presidential-year electorate.

Opinions of Elon Musk are sharply divided along party lines.

While Republicans give Musk favorable ratings (which has helped thaw GOP consumers' hostility to EVs), Democrats overwhelmingly hold strongly unfavorable views at 86 percent, creating a significant branding problem for Tesla.

Republican voters are deeply concerned about the loss of auto manufacturing jobs to China.

The majority of Republican voters worry that U.S. national security is at risk if America's industrial base continues to erode with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China. 88 percent worry at least some, including 53 percent who worry a lot.

The loss of federal EV subsidies cools consumer interest.

Roughly half of auto consumers say the end of federal EV incentives makes them less likely to buy or lease an electric vehicle. Conversely, an examination of EV sales in Germany after EV subsidies ended shows a strong recovery over the two years since the credits ended, following an initial sales decline.

Multifamily building residents remain a significant opportunity for increased EV sales if overnight ""Level 2"" charging is added to apartment buildings and condo parking.

65 percent of condo owners and 70 percent of apartment renters say they would be more likely to buy or lease an EV if their building offered overnight Level 2 charging in parking spaces. The finding highlights a major adoption barrier for urban and suburban consumers who lack access to private garages.

Consumers clearly report that the best path to selling more EVs, both in red states and blue, involves moving marketing messages away from ""green"" messaging and instead focusing on the many positive vehicle attributes that EV drivers enjoy, including fast, fun to drive, quiet, and the ability to avoid traditional and expensive gas stations.

The data show that consumers under 45 are far more open to EVs than older consumers, a trend that should grow as younger consumers age and gain market share. In a troubling long-term sign for existing auto brands in the U.S., younger consumers under 45 show a definite open-mindedness to purchasing Chinese-made vehicles, while consumers over 55 are far more hostile.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" said Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs. Since 80 percent of all EVs sold in America are sold in 15 states, smart pro-EV policy in those core states is the best public policy move in the short term. Opinions of EVs are always higher in states with a large EV market penetration since our data shows positive word of mouth is a huge factor in attracting more EV customers.""

Murphy said the findings offer timely context as national political leaders spotlight manufacturing and the auto industry.

""With the President heading to Detroit to talk about jobs and American manufacturing, this research underscores that EVs are an important path to creating more American auto jobs and helping secure U.S. auto manufacturing, not targets of a culture war,"" Murphy said. ""That only helps China seize the future of the global auto industry, a real threat to the U.S. and our allies. Automotive and political leaders should take our findings on younger consumers' interest in Chinese-made cars seriously as well.""

The report is based on annual national surveys of 600 registered voters age 18 and older in households earning $50,000 or more, representing more than 80 percent of the U.S. new- and used-vehicle market. EVs for All America conducted these surveys each November from 2023 through 2025. The report also incorporates additional research, including an October 2024 survey of 800 registered Republicans and an October 2025 survey of 400 California condo and apartment residents. National polling was conducted by Hill Research Consultants, with the California survey conducted by David Binder and Associates.

Scott Perry (R-10th District).
The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.
It requires mine operators to restore mined land and places a fee on mined coal to fund cleanup work at mines abandoned before the law was passed.
“The Abandoned Mine Land Fund is not a slush fund.
Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams.","A bill aimed at averting another government shutdown this month would divert $500 million for states and tribal governments to repair landscapes damaged by coal mining.

Pennsylvania, with a centuries-long legacy of resource extraction, stands to be the hardest hit by a loss of grant money if the transfer of funds remains in the final version.

House Resolution 6938 passed by a 397-28 vote in the U.S. House and is now in the U.S. Senate for consideration. The money is from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and would be redirected to wildfire management and National Forest Service operations.

It’s one of three bills in a “minibus” appropriations package for the upcoming fiscal year that congressional Democrats lauded for rejecting the Trump administration “draconian” cuts to a variety of federal programs, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service.

Each of Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. representatives voted in favor of the bill except for Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). His office did not respond to a request for comment.

While the commonwealth is one of more than two dozen states and tribes that received grants last year, Eric Dixon, a researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, said coal mining regions in Pennsylvania are most likely to feel the impact.

In 2025, the state received about $245 million or nearly 34% of the $725 million the U.S. Department of the Interior distributed. If Pennsylvania receives the same proportion of funds in the 2026 fiscal year budget, it would get between $130 million and $175 million less.

The money is used to address hazards from old open pit and underground mines, Dixon said, such as acid drainage polluting rivers and creeks, spoil piles that mar landscapes, and subsidence from subterranean collapses that can endanger homes and businesses.

“It’s not going to shut the program down, but it is going to be very meaningful for the homeowners who have subsidence or property that’s along a stream that’s not going to get cleaned up now,” he said.

Pennsylvania has the most acres of abandoned and unreclaimed mine lands and most abandoned wells of any state in the nation, according to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Press Secretary Neil Shader. The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.

“Cutting federal funding for these projects will hurt Pennsylvania’s ability to continue its historic work to create jobs and protect public health and safety,” Shader said, noting that IIJA funds paid to cap a majority of the 350 orphan wells under the Shapiro administration. The AML Fund is being used to address 450 abandoned mine sites across the state, he said.

Critics have characterized the transfer as a raid on the trust fund established by the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, the primary U.S. law regulating the environmental impact of coal mining. It requires mine operators to restore mined land and places a fee on mined coal to fund cleanup work at mines abandoned before the law was passed.

“The Abandoned Mine Land Fund is not a slush fund. It is a promise to communities that built this country and have lived for decades with the environmental damage left behind. Raiding it is unconscionable and an insult to hard-working families across Appalachia,” Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of the clean energy group PennFuture.

Bobby Hughes executive director of the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation said Pennsylvania was responsible for about one-third of all coal produced in the United States since it was first mined on an industrial scale in the late 1700s.

As a result, there are 28,000 abandoned mine sites across the commonwealth, 5,500 miles of polluted streams and at least 5,000 sources of acid mine drainage, Hughes said. That’s caused when water inside mines reacts with minerals in the rock, increasing its acidity and causing elements such as iron, aluminum and manganese to leach out.

“These are hazards that we’ve lived with, at least, I’ve lived with them for the last 50 some odd years, growing up here in the Wyoming Valley in the northern anthracite coal fields,” Hughes said.

Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams. The loss of those dollars would prevent such work and potentially have a negative impact on efforts to restore, reforest and redevelop them for industry, recreation and tourism.

“To take this kind of money away from … is not really doing any favor to our Appalachian communities that are already still struggling to come back out of the legacy of past minded practices,” Hughes said.

He added the investment in restoring mine land in Pennsylvania has benefits far beyond the commonwealth. The Susquehanna River, which receives mine drainage from northeastern Pennsylvania, is the Chesapeake Bay’s largest tributary. Hughes, who also sits on the board of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called it a national treasure.

“What we’re doing up here is cutting down on all kinds of sedimentation loads, coal, silts, metals, organics, phosphorus, nitrogen, that would end up going into the waterways, eventually reaching the bay, if we didn’t do the work we’re doing up here,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Catawissa-Creek-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:08.077512

The newly released ‘Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2025’, published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), highlights the increasing impact of geopolitical and geoeconomic frictions, as well as growing automation, to the renewable energy workforce.

As in previous years, it notes that uneven development continues across the world.

China remains the preeminent force in both deployment of generating capacities and equipment manufacturing, mainly owing to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices, according to Irena.

In 2024, the review points out that China created an estimated 7.3-million renewable energy jobs, or 44% of the global total.

It notes that the EU followed suit with the same total as in 2023, at 1.8-million jobs.

Additionally, it notes that Brazil’s renewables employment runs to 1.4-million, while employment in India and the US barely grew from about one-million to 1.3-million and 1.1-million, respectively.

“Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side.

“Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.

“The geographical imbalance of the job growth reminds us to get international collaboration back on track. Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community.

“This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socioeconomic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition,” says Irena director-general Francesco La Camera.

In terms of employment by technology, Irena notes that solar PV retains the lead, owing to the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing plants.

It explains that the industry employed 7.3-million people in 2024, noting that Asian countries hosted 75% of the world’s PV jobs with China garnering the bulk of the employment at 4.2-million.

Liquid biofuels follow after solar PV, creating 2.6-million jobs in 2024 with 46.5% of the total jobs generated in Asia.

Hydropower came in third place with 2.3-million jobs, and wind follows with 1.9-million jobs.

Beyond the numbers, this edition of the annual report underscores the need for more inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce, says Irena.

The agency says a just transition demands that no population groups – such as women and people with disabilities – are left at the margins, arguing that the renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives.

To this day, both groups’ potential remains underutilised, which calls for deliberate, multifaceted and systemic action, says Irena.

“A just transition to a renewables-based future must be grounded in inclusion, dignity, and equal opportunity.

“As countries scale up renewable energy investments and job creation, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that accessibility for persons with disabilities – who too often face barriers to inclusion in labour markets despite their skills, experience and talent - is built into every stage of policy design and implementation.

“This requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker’s rights.

“Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice; it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development. By removing barriers to equality and promoting decent work, we strengthen economies and ensure that the energy transition truly works for all,” says ILO director-general Gilbert Houngbo.

The review argues that fostering a culture that respects diversity and upholds inclusion and fairness requires sustained, inclusive policy frameworks including accessible education and training, labour market services, and other measures.

It says that designing and shaping such policies requires that all stakeholders have a seat at the table, especially those who are all too readily sidelined.

“Discriminatory practices and outdated social and cultural norms must be left in the past for the energy transition to truly drive more successful economies for all members of the community,” says Irena.

This twelfth edition of the Annual Review is part of Irena’s extensive analytical work on the socioeconomic impacts of a renewables-based energy transition.

This is the fifth edition developed in collaboration with ILO. Building on its expertise on the world of work, the ILO contributed the report’s chapter on inclusion of people with disabilities.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001246649_resized_irenaenjan261022.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:13.829841

The public lands grazing system was modernized in the 1930s in response to the rampant use of natural resources that led to the Dust Bowl — the massive dust storms triggered by poor agricultural practices, including overgrazing.
We also found that, in 2024 alone, the federal government poured at least $2.5 billion into subsidy programs that public lands ranchers can access.
The financial benefits of holding permits to graze herds on public lands extend beyond cattle sales.
Ranchers contend that public lands grazing has ecological benefits, such as preventing nearby private lands from being sold off and paved over.","The federal government allows livestock grazing across an area of publicly owned land more than twice the size of California, making ranching the largest land use in the West. Billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies support the system, which often harms the environment.

As President Donald Trump’s administration pushes a pro-ranching agenda, ProPublica and High Country News investigated how public lands ranching has evolved. We filed more than 100 public record requests and sued the Bureau of Land Management to pry free documents and data; we interviewed everyone from ranchers to conservationists; and we toured ranching operations in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada.

The resulting three-part investigation digs into the subsidies baked into ranching, the environmental impacts from livestock and the political clout that protects this status quo. Here are the takeaways from that work.

The system has evolved into a subsidy program for ranchers.

The public lands grazing system was modernized in the 1930s in response to the rampant use of natural resources that led to the Dust Bowl — the massive dust storms triggered by poor agricultural practices, including overgrazing. Today, the system focuses on subsidizing the continued grazing of these lands.

The BLM and Forest Service, the two largest federal land management agencies, oversee most of the system. Combined, the agencies charged ranchers $21 million in grazing fees in 2024. Our analysis found that to be about a 93% discount, on average, compared with the market rate for forage on private land. We also found that, in 2024 alone, the federal government poured at least $2.5 billion into subsidy programs that public lands ranchers can access. Such subsidies include disaster assistance after droughts and floods as well as compensation for livestock lost to predators.

A small number of wealthy individuals and corporations manage most livestock on public lands. Roughly two-thirds of the grazing on BLM acreage is controlled by just 10% of ranchers, our analysis found. And on Forest Service land, the top 10% of permittees control more than 50% of grazing. Among the largest ranchers are billionaires like Stan Kroenke and Rupert Murdoch, as well as mining companies and public utilities. The financial benefits of holding permits to graze herds on public lands extend beyond cattle sales. Even hobby ranches can qualify for property tax breaks in many areas; ranching business expenses can be deducted from federal taxes; and private property associated with grazing permits is a stable long-term investment. (Representatives of Kroenke did not respond to requests for comment, and Murdoch’s representative declined to comment.)

The Trump administration is supercharging the system, including by further increasing subsidies.

The administration released a “plan to fortify the American Beef Industry” in October that instructed the BLM and Forest Service to amend grazing regulations for the first time since the 1990s. The plan suggested that taxpayers further support ranching by increasing subsidies for drought and wildfire relief, livestock killed by predators and government-backed insurance. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Livestock grazing is not only a federally and statutorily recognized appropriate land use, but a proven land management tool, one that reduces invasive species and wildfire risk, enhances ecosystem health, and supports rural stewardship.” Roughly 18,000 permittees graze livestock on BLM or Forest Service land, most of them small operations. These ranchers say they need government support and cheaper grazing fees to avoid insolvency.

The administration is loosening already lax oversight.

Ranchers must renew their permits to use public lands every 10 years, including undergoing an environmental review. But Congress passed a law in 2014 that allows permits to be automatically renewed if federal agencies are unable to complete such reviews. In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, our analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about an additional 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review.

This is in large part because the BLM’s rangeland management staff is shrinking. The number of these employees dropped 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data, and roughly 1 in 10 rangeland staff left the agency between Trump’s election win and last June, according to BLM records.

The system allows widespread environmental harm in the West.

The BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands open to grazing, and assessments it conducts on the health of the environment found that grazing had degraded at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. The agency has no record of land health assessments for an additional 35 million acres. ProPublica and High Country News observed overgrazing in multiple states, including streambeds trampled by cattle, grasslands denuded by grazing and creeks fouled by cow corpses.

Ranchers contend that public lands grazing has ecological benefits, such as preventing nearby private lands from being sold off and paved over. Bill Fales and his family, for example, run cattle in western Colorado and have done so for more than a century. “The wildlife here is dependent on these ranches staying as open ranch land,” he said. While development destroyed habitat nearby, Fales said, the areas his cattle graze are increasingly shared by animals such as elk, bears and mountain lions.

Regulators say that it’s difficult to significantly change the system because of the industry’s political influence.

We interviewed 10 current and former BLM employees, from upper management to rank-and-file rangeland managers, and they all spoke of political pressure to go easy on ranchers. “If we do anything anti-grazing, there’s at least a decent chance of politicians being involved,” one BLM employee told us. “We want to avoid that, so we don’t do anything that would bring that about.” A BLM spokesperson said in a statement that “any policy decisions are made in accordance with federal law and are designed to balance economic opportunity with conservation responsibilities across the nation’s public lands.”

The industry has friends in high places. The Trump administration appointed to a high-level post at the U.S. Department of the Interior a lawyer who has represented ranchers in cases against the government and owns a stake in a Wyoming cattle operation. The administration also named a tech entrepreneur who owns a ranch in Idaho to a post overseeing the Forest Service.

Moreover, politicians from both parties are quick to act if they believe ranchers face onerous oversight. Since 2020, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have written to the BLM and Forest Service about grazing issues more than 20 times, according to logs of agency communications we obtained via public records requests.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SOCIAL250718_HCN_8267_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000-1-copy.jpg?resize=2000,1050",N,,2026-01-12 08:14:05.579033

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it was setting up a procedure for automakers to volunteer limits on the number of electric vehicles they ship from China to Europe.
“We have said from the start, as the European Commission, as the investigative authority in this case, that we’re willing to look at alternatives to the anti-subsidy duties we put in place,” said Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission.
Each automaker’s plan would have to be approved separately not only by the European Commission but also by member countries of the European Union — a potentially lengthy process.
In exchange, Volkswagen asked the European Commission to stop collecting its 20.7 percent anti-subsidy tariff on the Cupra.","The European Commission and China’s Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday guidance that could lead to the removal of tariffs on some electric vehicles imported from China, notably Volkswagen's Cupra Tavascan.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it was setting up a procedure for automakers to volunteer limits on the number of electric vehicles they ship from China to Europe. The automakers would also set minimum prices for which they would sell these cars.

Automakers that do limit the number of imported electric vehicles and pledge price floors could be exempt from the anti-subsidy tariffs of up to 35 percent that the European Commission imposed in late 2024 on electric cars from China.

“We have said from the start, as the European Commission, as the investigative authority in this case, that we’re willing to look at alternatives to the anti-subsidy duties we put in place,” said Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission.

The framework announced on Monday came as Europe was looking to develop more trade ties with regions other than the United States in response to President Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs and other initiatives.

But European leaders face a quandary. The United States is the only country in recent years that has been willing to run extremely large trade deficits, which has made the American market enticing for European exporters. China has severely limited purchases from Europe through a wide-ranging program of domestic production to replace imports.

Any arrangement for automakers to avoid paying the tariffs on E.V. shipments to Europe may not take effect quickly. Each automaker’s plan would have to be approved separately not only by the European Commission but also by member countries of the European Union — a potentially lengthy process.

The new procedure comes after Volkswagen broke ranks this winter with the Chinese car industry by volunteering to limit shipments to Europe of its Cupra electric cars from its factory in Hefei, China, and to set an undisclosed minimum price for the Cupras when they arrived in Europe.

In exchange, Volkswagen asked the European Commission to stop collecting its 20.7 percent anti-subsidy tariff on the Cupra. The commission’s move on Monday sets a procedure for reviewing such requests by automakers.

“We’ve issued this guidance because, in December, the first meaningful offer on a price undertaking came,” Mr. Gill, the commission’s spokesman, said. “We’ve taken the decision to issue this more detailed additional guidance in the event that other offers will come.”

China’s Ministry of Commerce has contended that automakers with factories in China should negotiate as a bloc with the European Commission, and should not submit their own offers. If automakers make separate proposals, they might compete against each other over concessions to Europe.

The Chinese ministry took a different stance late last year when seeking its own concessions from foreign producers. The ministry demanded that brandy producers in Europe each submit their own offers to set price limits on their sales to China.

European trade officials have been wary of accepting deals that allow automakers to set high minimum prices for their electric cars. That could allow automakers to fix prices and pocket the profits from limited sales in Europe instead of paying tariffs.

The European Commission reached a similar deal in 2013 for Chinese solar panel manufacturers to set high minimum prices in the European market in exchange for avoiding tariffs. The Chinese solar industry reaped large profits from these high prices and invested the money in new factories.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12biz-eu-china-ev1-wbqt/12biz-eu-china-ev1-wbqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 07:59:24.365715

Nextpower unveiled the JV with Saudi-based energy company Abunayyan Holding back in October 2025. The goal of this new JV is to accelerate the deployment of utility-scale solar PV plants across the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region.

Over the next two years, both companies forecast to fund the JV with nearly US$88 million in equity and public and private debt financings. According to Nextpower, the capital will help facilitate the buildout of the manufacturing facility and the development of high-skilled technical and engineering capabilities.

On top of providing advanced tracker systems with its manufacturing facility, Nextpower Arabia also aims to provide yield management and control solutions for installation on large-scale solar PV projects across the MENA region.

Nextpower already has a notable presence in the region, having delivered more than 6GW of tracking systems and software over the years, including for Phase V of the 900MW Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in the UAE and 3GW of projects in Saudi Arabia.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding CEO and Nextpower Arabia Chairman and CEO, said: “Our manufacturing facility represents the first step in our strategic vision to strengthen and localise the solar supply chain for our partners across the MENA region and enhance collaboration to deliver highly efficient and cost-effective clean energy.”

Al-Amri added that the facility will source Saudi-produced steel through strategic partnerships and local manufacturing.

Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta, added: “Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.
State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI.
The agreement includes the rights for Meta for energy for up to six additional units.
Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO, said: “To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s.","Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta announced that it has signed a series of large-scale nuclear power agreements, supporting up to 6.6 GW of energy by 2035 and enabling the social media and technology giant to help meet the energy demand of its rapidly growing data center footprint in the U.S., while maintaining progress on its clean energy and sustainability goals.

The announcement includes two deals to support the development of new advanced nuclear facilities by TerraPower and Oklo, and 20-year agreements with power company Vistra to purchase energy from and expand the capacity of existing nuclear power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Each of the new agreements resulted from a U.S.-focused nuclear RFP process launched by Meta in late 2024, as part of the company’s pivot to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations.

Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 climate goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.”

Following the launch of the RFP, Meta announced its first large-scale agreement with Constellation Energy in June 2025, extending the life of a nuclear energy facility in Illinois for 20 years to supply 1.1 GW of output to support Meta’s operations in the region.

Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta, added:

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.”

Meta’s new agreement with TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company started by Bill Gates, Nathan Myhrvold and John Gilleland, will provide funding to support the development of two new “Natrium” plants, which each combine a 345 MW sodium fast reactor with a molten salt energy storage system that can retain large amounts of energy that can be used to power the grid at peak demand when weather or darkness reduce renewable output.

While providing a baseload of 345 MW, each plants’ built-in storage system can boost energy delivery to up to 500 MW for over five hours. The agreement includes the rights for Meta for energy for up to six additional units. Delivery of the additional units is anticipated for as early as 2032.

Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO, said:

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs.”

California-based Oklo is developing next-generation fission power plants that can be fueled by recycled waste, while also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories. The agreement with Meta will support Oklo’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW power campus in Pike County, Ohio, providing funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project, targeted to come online as early as 2030, with the project expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to full capacity by 2034.

Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO described the new funding commitment from Meta as “a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward.”

DeWitte added:

“Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra’s agreements with Meta include 20-year PPAs for more than 2.6 GW of zero-carbon energy from 3 nuclear plants, including 2,176 MW of operating generation from 2 operating plants in Ohio, and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases from the Ohio plants, as well as from an additional plant in Pennsylvania, marking the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the U.S. to date. Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034.

Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra, said:

“When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution – to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today and we’re investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.”

When the Power Fails, Adaptation Fails That is why renewable energy is one of the most practical and life-saving adaptation measures of our time.
Renewable energy remains poorly integrated into global adaptation frameworks, energy resilience is rarely tracked through adaptation indicators and policies on energy, development and adaptation remain misaligned.
That means directing finance to decentralized renewable systems, integrating renewable energy into national resilience planning and ensuring that adaptation frameworks fully capture their impact.
Climate adaptation should not just be about rebuilding after disaster; it should primarily be about keeping societies functioning, resilient and thriving.","Climate adaptation is often described in terms of seawalls, drought-resistant crops or early warning systems. But in the places already living through intensifying heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, adaptation comes down to something far more fundamental: whether or not the power stays on. Without energy, hospitals fail, water stops flowing, lines of communications faulter and recovery gets stalled before it can even begin.

REN21’s latest strategic intelligence brief, Renewables for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, shows that adaptation has become a central pillar of economic and social resilience given intensifying climate change.

However, the brief warns that without effective adaptation, 18%-23% of global GDP could be lost by 2050, exposing nearly 20% of the global population to high climate risks. Communities around the world are already facing severe impacts from extreme weather, disrupting infrastructure, supply chains and essential services as well as their socio-economic consequences.

When the Power Fails, Adaptation Fails

That is why renewable energy is one of the most practical and life-saving adaptation measures of our time. Communities on the frontlines understood this long before global policy frameworks did.

In the Marshall Islands, repeated blackouts once shut down water, sanitation and communications for days at a time. For a country facing rising seas and saltwater intrusion, this was more than inconvenient. It was dangerous. As the government began scaling up decentralized renewables, the motivation was straightforward: survival. Renewable energy became energy security, and energy security became adaptation.

The Caribbean reached the same conclusion from experience. When Hurricane Melissa tore through Jamaica, some households equipped with rooftop solar systems that withstood the storm were able to continue generating electricity, keeping essentials like refrigerators running even as the central grid failed. Unfortunately, solar is still out of reach for many in Jamaica. However, falling prices, new tax credits, wider financing options and compensation for excess electricity that is fed into the grid are expanding access and supporting Jamaica’s goal of sourcing half of its electricity from renewables by 2030. As Caricom’s climate envoy put it, renewables have become “an important line of defense when the lights go out and when hurricanes strike.” These stories are repeated across small islands, rural regions and remote communities worldwide.

The pattern is clear: Vulnerability is also an energy problem. And renewables reduce vulnerability faster and more reliably than systems dependent on imported fuel and long supply chains.

This is not only a humanitarian or environmental argument. It is an economic one. Uruguay’s nearly 100% renewable electricity system now saves the country roughly $500 million each year and supports around 50,000 jobs. By eliminating exposure to global fuel price spikes, the country has built both economic and climate resilience. Its experience shows that renewables strengthen national budgets as much as they strengthen infrastructure.

The Economic Case for Energy Resilience

Meanwhile, many countries face rising energy demand alongside escalating climate impacts. Adaptation finance remains far below what economies require, and every disruption carries real economic costs. In this context, decentralized renewables offer an unusually effective form of risk reduction. They keep critical services running when extreme weather hits, and they lower long-term energy expenses. They are both resilience infrastructure and economic stabilizer.

Yet, despite their proven role, renewables have often been treated as a mitigation tool rather than a foundation of adaptation. That mindset is changing. A growing number of countries now explicitly link renewable energy with adaptation in their National Adaptation Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This shift reflects experience rather than theory. According to REN21’s strategic intelligence brief, countries that integrate renewables into adaptation planning do so because decentralized and diversified energy systems perform better under climate stress.

What emerges is a clear pattern. Governments are prioritizing renewable systems that reduce dependence on central grids, imported fuels and long supply chains, all of which are vulnerable to extreme weather. Distributed solar, mini- and microgrids, small-scale hydropower and household-level solutions are increasingly recognized as tools to keep essential services running when shocks hit. At the same time, countries are diversifying renewable energy sources to manage climate risks, particularly where changing rainfall patterns are undermining hydropower reliability. In practice, renewables are being treated not only as clean energy but as resilience infrastructure.

Closing the Gap Between Practice and Policy

Yet, the brief also highlights a growing disconnect between what is working on the ground and how adaptation is planned, financed and measured. Renewable energy remains poorly integrated into global adaptation frameworks, energy resilience is rarely tracked through adaptation indicators and policies on energy, development and adaptation remain misaligned. As a result, renewables-based adaptation is often underfunded and undercounted despite its proven ability to reduce risk and economic losses.

The evidence is overwhelming: When energy systems are local, diversified and independent of fuel supply chains, communities and economies are better protected. Countries are also recognizing the economic returns: Adaptation investments can boost GDP by up to 15 percentage points by 2050, while renewables-based resilience reduces recovery costs and fiscal exposure after climate shocks.

Now the task is to match practice with policy. Post-COP30, governments, development banks and climate funds have an opportunity to bring energy security into the heart of adaptation strategies. That means directing finance to decentralized renewable systems, integrating renewable energy into national resilience planning and ensuring that adaptation frameworks fully capture their impact.

Climate adaptation should not just be about rebuilding after disaster; it should primarily be about keeping societies functioning, resilient and thriving. On that measure, renewables are no longer a peripheral solution. They are critical infrastructure, and the world can no longer afford to treat them as anything less.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d912fc8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+35/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F89%2F193a17a1434e818ed5db1a8a4a59%2Fss-2334121883-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:21.920980

By supporting new approaches to key problems - storing renewable energy, extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and the huge carbon footprint of some industrial processes - these Fellowships are empowering researchers to tackle global warming.’

Professor Robert House will use the Fellowship funding to develop a new type of battery that is four times more energy dense than current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, thereby making them much lighter and powerful - and suitable for use in electric or hybrid aeroplanes. Using nanoengineering, the new battery will overcome the challenges presented by their Li-ion counterparts which carry a lot of excess unused weight in the electrode materials. Increasing the practical energy density four-fold will mean that batteries will be made much smaller and lighter, which could help electrify air travel.

He said: ‘The long-term Green Future Fellowship funding will allow me to launch an ambitious new research programme to develop novel battery concepts to meet the stringent performance and safety requirements for aerospace. This high-risk, high-reward research could transform the way we travel by air by making aeroplanes quieter and less polluting at airports, reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in the high atmosphere, and increasing the range of electric flying taxis. The technology could also have a wider impact on EVs as well as heavy goods, construction and mining vehicles, improving their power and driving range.’

Professor Moritz Riede will focus on accelerating the commercialisation of organic photovoltaics (OPV), to provide clean energy anywhere in the world at a fraction of the environmental footprint of traditional solar panels. OPV are solar cells made from carbon-based earth abundant raw materials. Being lightweight and flexible, they could be used for applications unsuitable for traditional solar panels such as curved surfaces or in transparent glass facades. But whilst OPV have exceeded 20% efficiency in the laboratory, commercial panels remain at around 8-9%.

Professor Riede will combine automation and machine learning to develop production methods for 20+% efficient OPV that work reliably at industrial manufacturing scale, closing the gap between laboratory and factory. This will accelerate OPV commercialisation - supporting UK Net Zero goals, creating jobs, and advancing a fair clean energy transition everywhere.

He said: ‘We know organic photovoltaics work very well in the lab. The challenge is achieving the same at scale in factories in a way that is both fast and affordable. That is what the climate urgency demands right now and that is what we are solving. Focusing on industrially relevant materials and proven processes, we aim to scale organic photovoltaics, the greenest and most equitable form of solar energy reaching low-, middle- and high-income countries alike.’

Professor James Naismith, Head of the Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences (MPLS) Division at Oxford University, said: ‘These Green Future Fellowships recognise the power of fundamental science and engineering to address one of the defining challenges of our time.

The Solution: Behind-the-Meter Microgrids

Independence Power deploys behind-the-meter microgrids in the form of battery energy storage systems, or “BESS”, that function as private, on-site power stations.

241 MW, 104-unit Deployed BESS Fleet: With 241 megawatts (MW) of energized, utility-scale batteries already under management, Independence Power's proprietary software acts as a ""shock absorber"" to stabilize power.

Uptime for AI and Oil: This setup ensures the near-perfect power quality needed for both upstream oil production and high-density AI data centers co-located at the source.

Immediate Deployment: Because these systems are behind-the-meter, they bypass the 30-month interconnection delays often seen with traditional grid power.

Fueling with Byproduct: Independence Power’s solutions enable capturing natural gas produced as a byproduct of oil drilling and converting it into low-cost electricity right at the source.

Strengthening National Energy Security

Independence Power’s solutions directly improve National Energy Security by ensuring the Permian Basin—responsible for 50% of America’s oil production—remains insulated from grid volatility. By stabilizing the power supply for the nation's most vital energy hub, Independence Power helps protect American energy independence from foreign pressures and domestic grid failure.

Addressing a 13 Gigawatt Power Gap

The Permian Basin is currently outgrowing its regional power grid. According to a comprehensive demand forecast conducted by S&P Global for the Texas energy grid operator, ERCOT, the Permian Basin is currently grappling with a power shortfall of 8 to 13 gigawatts. This gap creates ""dirty power""—voltage sags and surges that frequently crash industrial computers and damage high-value equipment.

High-Margin Recurring Revenue

With decades of experience in oil field logistics, founder David J. Durrett empowered Independence Power with an asset-light business model, seeking to generate high-margin recurring revenue as a Power-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider. Independence Power provides the proprietary software ""brain"" developed specifically for the extreme conditions of the West Texas desert to orchestrate these microgrids.

""Our proprietary software was born in the desert to solve the most difficult power challenges in the oil patch,"" said Todd Parkin, CEO of Independence Power. ""By pairing this technology with our customer’s 241 MW battery fleet, we are providing the stable, recurring energy backbone for both oilfield productivity and the AI revolution.”

Newsom has gone back-and-forth on using California resources to backfill the federal EV tax credits Trump cut. An initial 2024 proposal had market-share caps that would have excluded Tesla Inc.’s best-selling models, drawing the ire of Elon Musk who called the plan “insane.” The proposal was later dropped as California’s budget gap widened, with Newsom then saying that the state “wouldn’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

California is the biggest EV market in the country and Newsom’s proposal could be a boon for struggling manufacturers.

Tesla and other automakers reported slowdowns and declines in electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter after the loss of federal incentives, following a rush from EV buyers taking advantage of an expired $7,500 federal credit.

Led by a team of Rose-Hulman faculty, the project seeks to leverage Terre Haute's unique intellectual and industrial resources to fill a gap in STEM education and to create a pipeline to the workforce. Rose-Hulman Alfred R. Schmidt Endowed Chair for Excellence in Teaching & Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Jenny Mueller, PhD, delivered the winning pitch.

Rose-Hulman students, working closely with industry partners, will develop educational STEM kits and modules to pique the interests of students in grades 3-5 who may not currently see themselves in STEM fields or have an understanding of what a career in STEM might look like. The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange aims to support regional talent pipeline needs by inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders and learners.

A nod to Terre Haute's nickname as the ""Crossroads of America,"" the name of the project symbolizes the intersection and connection among Rose-Hulman, community partners, and industry partners. Designed in collaboration with several stakeholders, including North American Lighting, the Terre Haute Children's Museum, and the 14th and Chestnut Community Center in Terre Haute, the project is a step toward building a stronger STEM community identity.

""Our project seeks to bring meaningful STEM activities to children in community spaces outside of their schools,"" said Rose-Hulman Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Rebecca Bercich, PhD. ""This will address several barriers to STEM engagement and mentorship.""

Mueller serves as principal investigator on the grant, with support from Bercich; Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Kelley Dugan, PhD; Associate Dean of Professional Development and Professor of English Rich House, PhD; and Chief Director of Institutional Research, Planning, and Assessment and Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering Matt Lovell, PhD.

Rose-Hulman faculty and students, in conjunction with community and industry partner representatives, created the original pitch at the Community Engaged Alliance's Idea2Action September 2025 event, where they received actionable feedback and strong encouragement to continue pursuing this project. Students Jorge Luis Sol Casas, Jayne McCormack, Beej Bowling, and Stevie Irvine, co-authored and delivered this pitch.

In addition to providing quality educational materials to youth, the project also seeks to increase Rose-Hulman students' understanding of community context and civic identity. First-year mechanical engineering students in select sections of the Introduction to Design course will create the STEM education kits.

""How do you know if you know something? You can explain it clearly to someone younger than you,"" said Bercich. ""It also trains (Rose-Hulman students) in audience analysis, empathy, and adapting to non-technical audiences.""

By design, the Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange seeks to be more grounded in its community than existing STEM educational materials. Throughout the design process, the Rose-Hulman students will work in conjunction with an industry partner, such as North American Lighting, to develop hands-on activities that reflect authentic industry practice, as well as with the Terre Haute Children's Museum to ensure age-appropriate interactivity.

Faculty and student volunteers will facilitate the STEM kit modules over the summer at Terre Haute's 14th & Chestnut Community Center, which provides afterschool and summer programming in a safe space for children in historically underserved neighborhoods.

""For some students, it would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spark an interest or learn more,"" said Connor Scanlon, director of the 14th and Chestnut Center. ""(It's a) really good opportunity or experience that they are not going to have anywhere else.""

Three of the most prevalent barriers to accessing STEM education include transportation, expertise, and resources, including both time and funding. The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange seeks to overcome those barriers by meeting students at a community location they already visit, connecting local industries and universities to underserved neighborhoods, and volunteering student and faculty time to make a difference in the community.

The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange positions Rose-Hulman and Terre Haute as a nexus of curiosity and innovation, building and leveraging knowledge and partnerships across the community for mutual growth.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20240806-150136-248-rose-hulman.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 09:58:50.249962

Is there a growing awareness of the role of data analytics, and what do you think are the next steps for analytics providers?
With tougher operating economics and growing portfolios, operators are paying more attention to data and analytics.
This year, the industry must turn BESS data into a strategic advantage for proactive management of fleet-scale operations.
The Energy Storage Summit USA will be held from 24-25 March 2026, in Dallas, TX.","The two companies will offer customers in ERCOT an integrated offering that combines TWAICE’s insights into performance, safety, and lifecycle with Modo Energy’s market data on BESS asset performance. This offering aims to enable more accurate, asset-specific data calculation of revenues at the exact settlement point.

Hinrichs tells Energy-Storage.news that legislative and financial constraints faced by the US energy storage industry in 2025 were a “wake-up call,” highlighting the need to leverage data insights and for projects to be as coordinated and efficient as possible, all while maximising revenue-generating activities.

What did 2025 mean for the industry?

2025 saw record solar and storage deployment as developers rushed to qualify projects ahead of major rule changes in the United States. At the same time, higher interest rates, shifting tariffs, and new laws made projects more expensive and harder to finance. While the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ (‘OBBBA’) preserved incentives for battery storage, it also shifted the goalposts for them with more restrictive tax credits and foreign-entity rules.

That combination didn’t just slow deals: it changed what success looks like for the BESS industry.

What do you think 2026 will hold, in terms of both things to look forward to and in terms of challenges ahead?

The positives are that the industry is maturing, with operators no longer relying on crude and self-made tools to optimise dispatch and identify stranded capacity. Operators who ‘get’ data right can turn their growing BESS portfolios into success stories. Solutions will focus on operational outcomes, versus project delivery alone.

The challenges, on the other hand, are as follows:

Scaling problems could get worse as portfolios grow — multiple integrators, differing data connections and cell chemistries break pilot workflows.

State of charge (SOC) accuracy and imbalance detection remain challenging.

Derating (when parts of a site can’t deliver promised power) leads to penalties.

Contractual disputes over responsibility become more common.

Is there a growing awareness of the role of data analytics, and what do you think are the next steps for analytics providers?

Absolutely. With tougher operating economics and growing portfolios, operators are paying more attention to data and analytics.

As providers, we must focus on system-level analytics. While cell-level data is important, the most relevant metric for owners is what occurs at the point of interconnection (POI); analytics should therefore monitor the entire chain, including modules, racks, power conversion system (PCS), and transformers, to account for round-trip efficiency (RTE) and grid delivery requirements.

We also need to provide a ‘single pane of glass’ at fleet scale. As asset owners scale from pilot projects to gigawatt-hour portfolios, analytics tools must be able to handle billions of data points daily across diverse technologies and multiple integrators and present workflows, for both engineers and financial asset managers.

Analytics providers must move from reactive to proactive operations. Analytics should move away from merely alerting to automated, prescriptive actions that prevent downtime and penalties, translate failure modes into dollar impact (e.g., US$/MWh, avoided fines), and provide audit-ready evidence for lenders, insurers, and warranty claims.

What are the most challenging questions BESS developers need analytics to answer?

To give you a list:

Why is this site derating and when will it happen?

When should we rebalance or recalibrate SOC versus accept a temporary performance hit?

Which exact module, cell or component caused a failure so we can file warranty claims?

How much usable energy actually reaches the grid meter (not just DC-side numbers)?

Can analytics not only identify the root cause but also recommend and prioritize the right remediation steps?

We heard in the 2025 BESS Pros Survey from TWAICE that the role of analytics is shifting from a primary one of delivering safe operations to actively monetising storage assets. What does that really mean, and how can the industry best support this shift?

It means operators want assets that consistently earn revenue, not just assets that avoid incidents. To support that shift, you need: reliable, enriched telemetry; analytics that convert health and availability into dollars (expected revenue, avoided penalties); data ownership and a clean database to prove underperformance or support warranty claims; and cross-functional teams (ops, trading, finance) who share one source of truth.

What should the industry prioritise in 2026 and beyond?

Last year’s legislative and financing constraints were a wake-up call. Projects are now judged on predictable revenue and bankability, not just cost or speed.

This year, the industry must turn BESS data into a strategic advantage for proactive management of fleet-scale operations. To make that shift, the industry should focus on operationalising its data.

Operationalising data requires three steps. The first is to own the data, by ensuring reliable access to POI, system, and component telemetry across integrators and vendors.

The second is to create a single source of truth: normalising and centralising operational data so teams see a single, consistent view across sites and chemistries. The third and last is to turn high-volume data into a decision engine, in other words, converting standardised operational data into predictive KPIs, automated alerts and prescriptive workflows, so teams act proactively to prevent deratings, reduce safety risks, and maximise revenue.

The Energy Storage Summit USA will be held from 24-25 March 2026, in Dallas, TX. It features keynote speeches and panel discussions on topics like FEOC challenges, power demand forecasting, and managing the BESS supply chain.

The findings showcased that nuclear power – specifically NuScale NPMs – can help industries that use process steam and electricity in a reliable and profitable manner.

“As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity,” said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. “As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale’s scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study and the exciting new opportunities that small modular reactors introduce.”

Over the past two years, engineers from NuScale and ORNL partnered to form a composite engineering team. The group performed a TEA of nuclear and natural gas as energy sources for a number of steam and power generation configurations, including NPMs, gas boilers, and combined use, to meet the chemical plant’s steam and power demand with the most reliable and cost-competitive integrated energy system. The study utilized actual chemical plant conditions and historical data.

This assessment, a follow-on to an earlier study1 conducted using NuScale’s 50 MWe design, was based on NuScale’s NRC-approved uprated 77 MWe/250 MWt NPM design with a high-temperature, high-pressure, steam heat augmentation system. This new study used NuScale’s design with revised capital costs, a 10-day refueling outage time, reduced plant staffing, higher capacity factors, and a site boundary Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) methodology. The study examined factors such as steam reliability, operational costs, and system stability.

Upon completion of the comprehensive two-year study, the following key findings were reported:

The hybrid NPM/gas integrated energy system has a scalable architecture that offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability.

The 12-NPM plant is the most profitable, allowing the sale of excess power to the grid.

A minimum configuration of 4-NPMs combined with boilers can meet all of the chemical plant requirements.

An 8-NPM configuration allows for N-2 redundancy for very high reliability.

A wide range of hybrid combinations (NPMs with gas-fired boilers) are both viable and profitable.

The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet the chemical plant requirements – specifically 1.3 million kg/h of process steam, at 400°C (752°F), and 4.1 MPa (595 psia) – while also providing 73 MW of electric power.

Excess power generated could be exported to the grid for increased profitability for any combination.

The NPM with steam heat augmentation used highly-reliable, commercially available equipment to minimize costs and the use of high-temperature materials.

The TEA project was sponsored by the U.S. DOE’s GAIN program, and the ORNL report (ORNL/TM-2025/3938) with the assessment results for the integration of a NuScale SMR steam heat augmentation system with a chemical plant is now publicly available at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information.

""It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,"" Baker-White said.
""If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,"" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker.","When one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.

""We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,"" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. ""There are real impacts on real kids.""

The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.

The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.

Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as ""forever chemicals"" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.

Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.

Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.

""We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,"" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.

This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

""The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,"" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.

Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.

""It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,"" Baker-White said.

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP, or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.

There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.

""There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,"" Baker-White said.

In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It's a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling ""harmful and addictive"" products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas, and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.

Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don't agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven't focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans' championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.

Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.

Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.

""If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,"" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. ""We're going to step up as states and do the right thing.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/09/5d171f8c-3033-4a04-8463-044d70a77faa/thumbnail/1200x630g2/357cf794433729dfa561ad7c25453d25/2026-01-08t180405z-1889166885-rc24xia3yfn1-rtrmadp-3-usa-health-diet.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 08:58:39.180097

For the foreseeable future, the United States is no longer part of the global community trying to slow the Earth’s warming.","By pulling the United States out of the main international climate treaty, seizing Venezuelan crude oil and using government power to resuscitate the domestic coal industry while choking off clean energy, the Trump administration is not just ignoring climate change, it is likely making the problem worse.

President Trump has never been shy about rejecting the scientific reality of global warming: It’s a “hoax,” he has said, a “scam,” and a “con job.”

In recent days his administration has slammed the door on every possible avenue of global cooperation on the environment. At the same time, it is sending the message that it wants the world to be awash in fossil fuels sold by America, no matter the consequences.

The moves follow one of the hottest years on record, during which scientists say climate change supercharged raging wildfires in Los Angeles, deadly flooding in Texas, and a Category 5 hurricane that ravaged Caribbean islands.

The planet is on course to heat up more than 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the risks of catastrophic storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves, as well as species extinction, increase significantly. The Earth has already warmed by between 1.3 and 1.4 degrees Celsius.

Under President Trump, the United States has become the only nation to renege on a pledge to try to keep warming to 1.5 degrees. Its actions will make the global fight harder, scientists said.

“Emissions will be higher,” warned Justin S. Mankin, an associate professor at Dartmouth College who researches climate variability. “Trump’s greenhouse gas emissions will cause Trump’s heat waves, Trump’s droughts, Trump’s floods, and Trump’s wildfires.”

America’s carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas, which have made it the biggest polluter since the start of the Industrial Age, had been declining steadily since 2007. But last year, after Mr. Trump returned to the White House, emissions rose 1.9 percent, according to the federal government.

Researchers attributed the rise to an increased use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Scientists said U.S. emissions should ultimately decline again, in large part because renewable energy remains cheaper than fossil fuels. But the decrease could be slower and smaller than a safe atmosphere requires.

“The science is clear that every action matters and every ton of carbon matters,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech. “There’s a price to pay for every ton of carbon we produce, and that price is being added to our global debt.”

On Wednesday Mr. Trump announced that he was withdrawing the United States from a long list of United Nations organizations, including the treaty that underpins international cooperation on global warming and a Nobel Prize-winning group made up of the world’s leading climate scientists.

It came days after the U.S. seized control of Venezuela’s oil, the largest known supply in the world but a particularly “dirty” grade, which produces more greenhouse gases when burned than American oil.

And those were just the latest maneuvers. Over the past months, the administration has forced five domestic power plants that burn coal to continue operating despite their planned retirement. It also halted five offshore wind farms along the East Coast that are already partially built and were to provide clean energy to millions of homes and businesses.

Those moves capped a year in which the Trump administration systematically eliminated regulations designed to reduce greenhouses and gutted federal subsidies that could have brought more wind and solar power onto the grid. With Republican allies in Congress, the administration erased incentives to help consumers switch to nonpolluting electric cars from gasoline-burning vehicles. At the same time, federal agencies imposed new policies making it easier and cheaper to produce and burn oil, gas and coal.

Trump administration officials have insisted that investment in clean energy hurts the United States.

“When it comes to climate change we just chuck rationality at the door,” Chris Wright, the Energy secretary, said this week at a Goldman Sachs energy event in Miami. He claimed clean sources don’t produce enough energy and don’t reduce emissions, calling it “the greatest malinvestment in human history.”

Scientists disagreed.

“In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined that the Trump administration would do the level of destruction they have tried to do to the development of renewable energy in this country,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. “Why didn’t I think it imaginable? Because it’s not rational.”

Dr. Oppenheimer said the totality of Trump administration actions could lead to either a rise in U.S. emissions or a slowing of their decline. The severity of the climate consequences depends upon how long the policies stay in place.

Calculating the potential impact of the Trump administration on emissions is complicated by the fact that some of the changes to policy and regulations have not yet taken effect.

One study conducted by the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group, found that some of the biggest regulatory actions being taken by Mr. Trump could add 32 billion metric tons of additional climate pollution to the atmosphere by 2055, more than four times the country’s annual emissions today.

“The administration seems hellbent on blowing past ever more dangerous thresholds,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford climate scientist who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ climate emissions.

He noted that China and Europe are continuing to lead the world in addressing climate change, but said he worries about the signal Mr. Trump’s actions send globally.

“They won’t continue to act on their own forever if countries like the U.S. ignore the threat of climate change,” Dr. Jackson said.

As more distilleries become insolvent amid weakening demand, bankruptcy trustees tasked with raising as much money as possible to repay creditors face a problem: how to sell off alcohol that needs years of aging before it can be called straight bourbon. Anything before that point is raw distillate with far less value.

Bourbon is just one example of the increasingly eclectic, and often difficult to value, classes of assets being offered for sale through the bankruptcy marketplace. Alongside real estate, unused tax credits, intellectual property, and unpaid judgments, debtors across the financial spectrum have offered a 1990 Ferrari F40, private jets, thoroughbred horses, crypto accounts, and even batches of unused Starbucks gift cards.

The marketplace offers a window into a hidden corner of the economy, where conventional, unconventional, and emerging assets are priced, marketed, and sold under court supervision. What appears for sale often mirrors broader bankruptcy filings and financial stress.

Spirit Airlines, for instance, listed 23 aircraft for sale during its first bankruptcy in 2024 as travel demand softened after the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The economy dictates what we may see and what we may be selling, it’s debtor-driven,” Donald R. Lassman, an attorney and bankruptcy trustee in Massachusetts, said.

Most recently, a Claude Monet ‘Water Lilies’ painting from the collection of bankrupt hedge fund manager George Weiss showed up on Inforuptcy, a subscription website for professionals and distressed-asset investors that scans court documents and sale motions from the government’s online docket system and converts them into listings. Think Craigslist, only for bankruptcy assets.

Inforuptcy, a for-profit business founded in 2012, had about 8,000 listings last year.

“That’s the beauty of bankruptcy, any type of asset can come through the courts,” co-founder Michael Mikikian said. “There’s been crypto, $100 million homes, $100-plus-million companies. Everything flows through here.”

There are deals to be found, but low-ball offers generally won’t go anywhere. Every purchase must survive sale hearings, potential creditor objections, and approval from a judge—though court-approved sales have the advantage of being declared in good faith and free of most liens, claims, and other encumbrances.

“You must read the sale motion, maybe you have to show up to the hearing, or have a security deposit to bid,” Mikikian said.

The Monet

A Monet Nymphéas oil painting from between 1914 and 1917 is something you’d expect to see at a Christie’s or Sotheby’s auction. But since it was part of the Weiss bankruptcy estate, it went through a court-ordered sale.

“There is a limited universe of buyers who can put forward close to $40 million,” said Jennifer Morris, an art historian and attorney at Morris Art Law who represented the eventual buyer. “This isn’t your average art buyer.”

The Monet is one of the artist’s later works, marked by looser and thicker brushstrokes due to his declining eyesight, Morris said. Unlike earlier pieces, this one offers a top-down view onto the water, features pastel colors like violets and blues, and is notable for its balanced, almost square composition that draws the viewer’s eye directly to the center.

It lacks the complexity seen in Monet’s more significant later paintings of ‘Water Lilies,’ said David Shapiro, an art adviser with experience appraising the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts. They have richer color and “are more resolved paintings, with this painting looking more sketch-like by comparison,” he said.

As of late November, nine Monet paintings of ‘Water Lilies’ have sold at public auctions for more than $50 million, including buyer’s premium, he added.

The bankruptcy court ultimately approved the sale of Weiss’s Monet in October for $36.5 million. There were no competing bids after another deal fell through, when a potential buyer couldn’t secure funding.

The art world has crossed into bankruptcy before, most notably through Detroit’s “Grand Bargain,” launched to prohibit the sale of works from the then city-owned art institute to pay off debt and to help raise funds to protect pensions in 2014. And more recently, artwork from the Boy Scouts of America’s collection, including paintings by Norman Rockwell, was auctioned to raise money for a trust to compensate former Scouts who claimed they were sexually abused.

Shifting Marketplace

More asset categories, such as credits tied to emissions reduction programs and tax credits, are entering the market.

Among recent credit sellers is Nikola Corp., the electric-vehicle maker founded by Trevor Milton, who was convicted of securities and wire fraud and then pardoned last year by President Donald Trump. The company sold environmental credits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and California’s Air Resources Board for $15.3 million.

Manufacturers often buy these credits to comply with federal and state emissions and fuel-efficiency standards.

Tax credits can also be challenging to value, and some could create exposure for buyers, particularly when they are subject to recapture depending on their structure, use, and transfer.

“It’s notoriously difficult to value tax assets, as the tax laws can change at any time and often do change with new presidential administrations, and most credits can only be enjoyed if there’s future income to generate sufficient tax liability,” said Diane Lourdes Dick, who teaches business and tax law at the University of Iowa College of Law.

Other assets seemingly making a comeback, based on Inforuptcy listings, are judgments and claims. Judgments can be sold for $2,500 to $171,300, as in a recent listing. An employment discrimination claim against a health-care tech company was listed at $5,000.

David Pullman, CEO of the Pullman Group, contacts trustees seeking income streams of all kinds, such as music, book, and film and TV royalties, as well as oil and gas royalties. Getting that federal court order finding as a good faith buyer is a win, he explained.

“It’s helped us expedite things in terms of parties that need to pay us. Using a federal court order to resolve these matters works better than just relying on an agreement or assignment,” Pullman said. “You can run into more issues with just an assignment without a court order.”

Gregory G. Plotko, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg LLP in New York who often represents creditors and distressed asset buyers, said investment and credit funds are interested in “esoteric” assets such as class-action claims, tax refunds, and litigation claims. While the legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs is before the Supreme Court, claims for potential tariff reimbursements are being monetized as well, he said.

Due to liquidity constraints and financial needs, distressed companies “won’t wait to see what happens with the cases, if the government will really pay it back, or how long that will take,” Plotko said.

In his role as a trustee, Lassman sometimes prefers to sell judgments instead of trying to collect them to cut litigation costs. The market for judgments isn’t well-defined, he said, so he solicits offers rather than setting prices.

“I want to close the bankruptcy cases and get money to creditors as fast as I can, so it’s much better for me to discount or just to list it for sale and see what kind of offers I can get,” Lassman said.

Tricky Valuations

Intellectual property is a common bankruptcy asset, but valuation can be challenging because it often varies based on interest and market trends. Trademarks are especially difficult to value, said Christine H. McCarthy from Barnes & Thornburg in Washington.

While bankruptcy lets a company break many contracts or obligations attached to its assets, that’s not always true for trademark rights.

“A proper and complete valuation of an IP portfolio requires figuring out exactly what rights are involved and who owns them,” she said.

A recent example involves golf legend Jack Nicklaus, who is challenging his former golf services company’s bid to sell assets in bankruptcy. He claims he holds veto rights over the use, sale, or transfer of IP.

Trustees also struggle over what to do with crypto assets. “First, how do you find them?” Lassman said. “Assume you find them, how do you gain control so you can then sell them?”

With other assets, the challenge is the cost of holding them.

With a thoroughbred horse, “you can’t put it in a warehouse until some later time,” said Ellen Arvin Kennedy, a partner at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP in Kentucky. “But maximizing its value in a bankruptcy would be very difficult.”

The timing of bankruptcy may not align with thoroughbred sales seasons in which sellers benefit from competitive bidding among a large pool of buyers—typically spring and fall—and in the meantime, the estate must cover food, shelter, boarding, and other care to preserve the horses’ value, she added.

“Thoroughbred horses are notoriously difficult to value depending on how they perform, their lineage, how they’ve been trained, and who’s trained them, all those things sort of factor into their value,” Kennedy said.

Holding bourbon barrels until the liquor matures isn’t simple either. Warehousing costs money, and a trustee would need court approval to finance storage. The market is also narrow, with established distillers already tied to their own brands and flavor profiles and less likely to buy an untested product.

“Some investors may say, ‘I’ll buy it, pay for the warehouse space, and see what happens. Maybe bourbon weathers the storm, and by the time it is ready to sell, I can bottle it and make a profit,’” she said.

As for fine art, while the Monet may have been the first to appear on Inforuptcy, it wasn’t the last artwork.

Soon after came works by Sam Gilliam, Bob Thompson, and Norman Lewis, all from the bankruptcy estate of entertainment attorney Ronald E. Sweeney, a collector of African-American art who once represented rapper Lil Wayne.

At least one buyer has expressed interest in one of the paintings, according to a court filing, though talks slowed over the winter holidays.

If the works sell—and a judge is satisfied—the bankruptcy estate could net as much as $1.6 million.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/df75941/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fe3%2Fae45ab0e4bc089ff79bf63a5e82b%2Fbrowserpreview-tmp.png,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:42.323691

The arrangement provides that multinational groups headquartered in the US will be excluded from the majority of Pillar Two requirements, which in Ireland have been introduced through the EU Minimum Taxation Directive.

Under the agreed approach, jurisdictions that operate a minimum tax regime sharing comparable objectives and a similar scope to Pillar Two may be granted Side-by-Side status (SbS).

The documentation highlights that, in Ireland, qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes (QDMTTs) that are consistent with Pillar Two will continue to apply to Irish subsidiaries of US-based multinational groups.

This means that QDMTTs are expected to remain payable in Ireland, supporting the continuation of comparable tax outcomes across affected entities.

Congress is predominantly rejecting President Trump's proposal to dramatically slash natural resource agency budgets, according to bipartisan plans released this week that seek to uphold funding for national parks and forests, as well as energy and water infrastructure.

The fiscal year 2026 budget proposals for the Department of Energy, the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and key science agencies include small trims, but largely reject the major cuts the Trump administration outlined more than six months ago.

The president's request for the National Park Service, for example, would have cut $1 billion in funding. Instead, Congress is opting to keep funding nearly flat at $3.27 billion.

""We are really happy that appropriations leadership on the Republican and the Democratic side are making a very clear statement that our national parks should be supported in terms of funding and in terms of staffing,"" said John Garder, the senior director of budget and appropriations at the National Parks Conservation Association.

The organization estimated that the National Park Service has lost more than 24% of its permanent staff since the beginning of the Trump administration. Garder said the budget package requires public lands agencies to maintain the staffing levels needed to fulfill their missions.

The package has the support of Republican House leaders. It includes increased funding for oil and gas development, support for critical minerals extraction and investments to expand nuclear energy capacity.

""We prioritize American energy dominance and safeguarding critical mineral resources, national parks will be open and operating essential wildfire protection programs will remain in place,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said during a committee hearing Tuesday.

Lawmakers want to get the budgets over the finish line by the end of this month to avoid another government shutdown. Colorado's Democratic senators earlier said they intended to object to moving the budgets forward over the Trump administration's plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.

Within the framework of associated gas utilization plans and the reduction of methane and greenhouse gas emissions, Petroecuador continues to optimize its operations by using associated gas for electric power generation in its oil fields.

In blocks 44 (Pucuna) and 61 (Auca Sur), two power generation plants that use gas as fuel were put into operation, with an installed capacity of 300 kW and 4.000 kW, respectively. These plants make it possible to replace the use of diesel, considered one of the highest-value fuels in oil operations.

In block 61 (Auca Sur), gas consumption for power generation reaches 1.59 million standard cubic feet per day, which makes it possible to produce approximately 104,640 kwh of energy per day, generating an estimated annual saving of USD 7.21 million.

To that point, there are still several ongoing clean energy policies that are actively supporting solar companies in the United States. This includes tax credits for solar companies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has directly driven Array's expansion.

Furthermore, Array is indirectly benefiting from other domestic incentives for solar manufacturing as one of the world’s leading providers of solar tracker systems that are used in large-scale solar power plants. In other words, more utility-scale solar = more trackers = more demand for Array’s products.

Leadership Changes Signal Confidence

Array recently promoted two senior leaders: Darin Green to Global Chief Revenue Officer and Nick Strevel to Chief Product Officer. Moves like this often signal internal confidence and a push toward scaling revenue and product innovation, which can boost investor sentiment.

Right on cue, Array has announced that its North American segment is already showing significant improvement under the new Chief Revenue Officer’s leadership.

Array’s Increasing ROIC

Starting to suggest long-term shareholder value since going public in 2020, Array’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has seen a sharp uptick toward the often admirable level of 20% or higher. Showing the ability to effectively turn invested capital into profits, Array’s ROIC is currently at 19% and tops industry giant First Solar’s FSLR 13%.

Considering many solar companies are still in the early stages of their development, strong ROIC separates those that will potentially compound wealth from those that simply burn cash or waste resources.

Steady Growth & Attractive Valuation

Indicative of its future earnings potential, Array is already on the cusp of bringing in over $1 billion in annual sales, a rather robust top line for a stock that investors are paying under $10 a share for.

Array is thought to have ended fiscal 2025 with annual earnings rising 11% to $0.67 per share. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to soar another 44% to $0.97. The company will be reporting Q4 2025 results on February 26, after most recently crushing Q3 EPS and sales estimates by 42% and 25%, respectively.

More intriguing is that Array’s stock trades at 9X forward earnings, well below the Solar industry average of 18X and an even steeper discount to the benchmark S&P 500. ARRY is also trading at just 1X forward sales, with the industry average being closer to 2X and the S&P 500’s average at nearly 6X.

The expansion will see output at the facility grow from 98 million to 193 million gallons of bioethanol annually, boosting the production of key coproducts such as dried distillers grains and corn oil. Construction is expected to begin in March, with completion slated for late 2027.

Jeff Lautt, POET’s president and chief operating officer, described the project as a clear vote of confidence in both the biofuels sector and American agriculture.

He emphasised that the increased capacity will not only strengthen local farm markets by increasing corn demand, but also create good-paying rural jobs, with around 20 new full-time positions anticipated at the expanded plant.

The investment is timely, coming as global interest in cleaner, low-carbon fuels grows in response to climate and energy security concerns. Ethanol, typically blended with petrol to lower greenhouse gas emissions, remains a key component of renewable fuel strategies in the United States and abroad.

For farmers in the Shelbyville area, the doubling of capacity means significant new market opportunities, with the plant projected to demand millions more bushels of corn annually.

“The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the EIA wrote.
Additionally, some data center loads are extremely variable and rapidly changing, with power demands fluctuating quickly as compute workloads shift.
“Behind every data center, there’s a web of power decisions: where to build, how to connect, how to scale,” MacDowell said.
“Proper modeling and well-designed architectures can future-proof your data center power system plan.” Consider the seemingly straightforward decision about where to locate a data center.","At one level, the challenge of meeting load growth from data centers is straightforward. After all, the task is fundamentally about quickly delivering a substantial amount of electrons to data centers to power cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications (AI).

The sheer scale of the demand for electricity is enormous, especially for a utility industry that spent decades forecasting flat or even declining load growth. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) most recent short-term energy outlook (STEO) report forecast commercial electricity consumption to grow 3% in 2025 and 5% in 2026, a revision up from the annual increase of 2% EIA had previously projected.

“The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the EIA wrote. A report last year by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) reached similar conclusions, finding that the percentage of the nation’s electricity consumed by data centers could rise from 4.4% in 2023 to as much as 12% in 2028.

Complexity beyond scale

Utilities obviously want to serve data centers. However, the question for both utilities and data center developers is whether extremely large and reliable amounts of electricity can be provided within the required timeframe — speedy access to power is a key strategic imperative for data centers.

But the reality is that very little about meeting the enormous electricity demand from data centers is straightforward. For example, besides their sheer size, data centers have unique load characteristics, whether they’re being used to train new models or for inference, when trained AI models produce answers to questions users ask. Additionally, some data center loads are extremely variable and rapidly changing, with power demands fluctuating quickly as compute workloads shift.

This rapidly changing variability can put mechanical stress on a behind-the-meter or grid-connected but dedicated turbine. “That stress can cause a torsional pulsing or torsional vibration on the drive trains that could reduce the life of the shaft,” said Jason MacDowell, director of integrated systems for GE Vernova’s Consulting Services, referring to the long steel shaft connecting the turbine and the generator. “It could reduce the life of the equipment, and in extreme cases, if it’s not mitigated or if it’s not protected, it could even break the equipment.”

The menu of challenges data centers pose to utilities and the broad ecosystem of partners involved in delivering power also includes shifts between grid and backup power as well as the need for exceptional reliability — as high as 99.99% or even 99.999% of the time. It’s a task that requires careful and sophisticated planning capabilities able to weigh a staggering number of variables and uncertainties.

An integrated approach to planning

So how do utilities and developers navigate these and other challenges? The answer: with the help of sophisticated, integrated planning that accounts for not just grid conditions today, but for how those conditions will evolve over the next few decades. “Behind every data center, there’s a web of power decisions: where to build, how to connect, how to scale,” MacDowell said. “Proper modeling and well-designed architectures can future-proof your data center power system plan.”

Consider the seemingly straightforward decision about where to locate a data center. It would be simple to assume that the choice would come down to where a grid connection has sufficient capacity today. That’s clearly one factor to consider, but grid conditions also change, changes that can impact the reliability of power and the economics of a project.

Gene Hinkle, general manager, power economics for GE Vernova’s Consulting Services, recalls working with a data center developer trying to choose between two sites that looked similarly viable on paper. “When we ran our pricing and congestion forecast 15 years ahead, one site showed escalating costs that would have doubled their energy costs,” Hinkle recalled. “The other offered stable pricing and fewer downside risks. That insight turned what looked like a coin toss into a confident decision.”

Effective planning for the numerous power-related factors that can impact data centers requires a range of capabilities that analyze interdependent factors over decades — encompassing everything from data-driven infrastructure analysis to power flow dynamics, congestion risk, and locational marginal pricing.

Deep analysis extends beyond power availability. Hinkle recalls working with a large data center developer that was convinced it had the perfect site: good land, low-cost energy, and fiber connectivity nearby. GE Vernova’s risk modeling, however, identified flooding risk at the site and instead suggested an alternative location three miles away. “The move likely saved the client millions of dollars and years of delay,” Hinkle said. “Uncertainty is expensive.”

For integrated planning to be as valuable as possible, it should also be informed and guided by decades of expertise in utility and developer planning. The combination of sophisticated and holistic planning tools with deep industry expertise is particularly important because data center demand for reliable power is increasingly leading developers to consider on-site power solutions. “On one end of the spectrum, we’re working on totally islanded power system architectures where the data center, the substation, and the generation are completely isolated from the bulk grid,” said Yazan Al-Saif, director of integrated systems for data centers at GE Vernova’s Consulting Services.

This adds another layer of complexity that demands sophisticated planning able to answer challenging questions. How do you maintain grid stability under any scenario? Can on-site resources provide needed flexibility to the grid and, in certain cases, be used to take advantage of energy arbitrage opportunities? Even when utilities don’t especially welcome these on-site resources, they need to understand them and how they interact with grid operations.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GWMZMuC2HCP9RFC4sLtEarP14v9w6d851fh6eY59tuE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NTEwMDAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-12 08:13:42.796196

Soaring power demand from data centers and AI is colliding with an already strained electric grid.

As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal-generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

On a daily basis, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price ranged from US$2.65 per million Btu to US$9.86 million Btu, reflecting a narrower range of daily prices compared with the previous year.

Natural gas prices tend to be higher in winter months, when colder winter temperatures lead to more demand for natural gas, both directly for space heating and indirectly because natural gas is also the most prevalent source of electricity generation in the US. Demand for US LNG exports also rose by an estimated 3 billion ft3/d in 2025 as US LNG export capacity increased.

Lower prices over the summer were driven by record high production, which increased by an estimated 4.5 billion ft3/d, and less natural gas consumption in the electric power sector. Natural gas spot prices gradually rose in the final months of 2025 because of factors such as a polar vortex event in late November and early December, which briefly pushed prices above US$5.00 per million Btu.

US natural gas spot prices at most major trading hubs increased in 2025, except at the Northwest Sumas point near the US-Canada border. Two hubs in the Northeast – Algonquin Citygate near Boston and Transco Zone 6 NY near New York City – had price increases that were much more than Henry Hub’s US$1.33 per million Btu increase in 2025, according to data from Natural Gas Intelligence.

In the Northwest, the annual average natural gas spot price at Northwest Sumas fell by US$0.24 per million Btu in 2025 as ample natural gas supply from Canada coincided with less demand for natural gas-fired electricity in the Pacific Northwest region. Natural gas production in Western Canada set record highs last year, led by the Montney, a shale basin in British Columbia and Alberta.

In the Northeast, natural gas spot prices in New York (Transco Zone 6 NY) and New England (Algonquin Citygate) surged in early 2025, primarily driven by colder temperatures and supply constraints within the region’s pipeline network. Natural gas prices at the Algonquin Citygate averaged US$16.37 per million Btu in January and US$14.00 per million Btu in February, the highest prices for these months since 2022, coinciding with a polar vortex event. Spot natural gas prices in the Northeast tend to be more volatile during winter months when rising regional natural gas demand leads to more congestion on the natural gas pipeline network.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/dollar-money-01.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:05:19.312303
,Indiana Environment,2026-01-12 09:19:09+00:00,WVXU,A solar array will soon help power Fairfield's wastewater plant - WVXU,"Isabel Nissley, www.wvxu.org, isabel-nissley",,,,,https://www.wvxu.org/environment/2026-01-12/fairfield-solar-array-wastewater-plant,"Fairfield is breaking ground Monday on a five-acre solar array next to its wastewater treatment plant on Groh Lane.
“This year, 2026, we would spend about $370,000 in electric for the wastewater treatment plant without the solar array — it’s a big ticket item in our operating budget,” Sackenheim said.
Sackenheim says Fairfield can justify the capital cost of building the solar array because of the increasing cost of electricity.
The project also is set to reduce the amount of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions that come from powering the wastewater treatment plant.
The solar array is expected to be operational by this summer.","The city of Fairfield is starting construction on its first renewable energy project.

Fairfield is breaking ground Monday on a five-acre solar array next to its wastewater treatment plant on Groh Lane. Assistant City Manager Adam Sackenheim says the solar panels will provide about 65% of the electricity needed to power the utility.

“It's going to help us save money,” Sackenheim said. “It's going to help us reduce our environmental footprint.”

Fairfield decided to pursue renewable energy initiatives and efficiency projects when city council adopted the Fairfield Sustains plan in 2024. Sackenheim says it made sense to undertake the first renewable energy project at the wastewater treatment plant because it’s the single largest energy user of all the city’s facilities.

“This year, 2026, we would spend about $370,000 in electric for the wastewater treatment plant without the solar array — it’s a big ticket item in our operating budget,” Sackenheim said.

The city expects to save $2.5 million over the solar array’s 30-year life expectancy. Melink Solar is constructing the 1.5-megawatt array.

The project costs $2.9 million. It will be paid for, in part, by a federal tax rebate.

Sackenheim says Fairfield can justify the capital cost of building the solar array because of the increasing cost of electricity.

“Where the city in the past was paying 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour for its electric energy — a very, very, very low rate — now, we're paying closer to 8 cents per kilowatt hour,” Sackenheim said. “Just in the last three to four years, our electric rates, like everyone, have doubled. And we don't see that slowing down.”

He says he hopes having the solar array will help Fairfield keep sewer rates stable.

The project also is set to reduce the amount of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions that come from powering the wastewater treatment plant.

Sustainability Program Manager Gillian Hart says Fairfield intends to do more projects like this in the future.

“Because this is our first large scale utility solar project like this, this is going to lay the groundwork for future efficiency and energy projects that pertain to our sustainability action plan,” Hart said.

The solar array is expected to be operational by this summer.

,American Energy,2026-01-12 09:10:06+00:00,Canary Media,"Finally, New England's clean-energy transmission line is ready to go",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/new-england-clean-energy-connect-come-online,"As soon as this Friday, the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line could begin commercial operations.
“This is a significant moment for clean energy in New England,” said Phelps Turner, director of clean grid for the Conservation Law Foundation.
Avangrid, the developer of the transmission line, told Maine utility regulators earlier this month that operations are scheduled to begin on Jan. 16.
The first idea for importing power from the north involved working with a planned 192-mile transmission line through New Hampshire.
Massachusetts then looked east, to Maine, to find a route for the transmission line.","Nearly 10 years after Massachusetts announced plans to buy 1.2 gigawatts of carbon-free hydropower from Canada, the clean electrons are finally set to start flowing into the state.

As soon as this Friday, the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line could begin commercial operations.

The 145-mile project, extending from the Canadian border to the southern Maine city of Lewiston, will function as something like an enormous extension cord, plugging the New England grid into a supply of electricity generated by energy giant Hydro-Québec. The new supply is expected to save the average residential customer in Massachusetts $18 to $20 per year and move the state closer to its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

“This is a significant moment for clean energy in New England,” said Phelps Turner, director of clean grid for the Conservation Law Foundation.

Avangrid, the developer of the transmission line, told Maine utility regulators earlier this month that operations are scheduled to begin on Jan. 16. Work is underway to meet that target.

“Teams are busy on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border,” said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Lynn St-Laurent. ​“We have been actively testing the equipment for the past several weeks.”

Following a tumultuous year for clean energy projects, the completion of the controversial transmission line is both a rare triumph and a case study in the challenges of balancing decarbonization and the preservation of wild lands. It’s also an uncommon example of transmission getting built in the U.S., where it has proven difficult to construct the massive power lines needed to deliver new electricity supply to population centers.

The project has its roots in a 2016 Massachusetts law that called for the state to procure 1.2 gigawatts of Canadian hydropower, or other renewables, and 1.6 gigawatts of offshore wind energy. The first idea for importing power from the north involved working with a planned 192-mile transmission line through New Hampshire. However, the project was scuttled in 2019 by public outcry against the prospect of chopping a path through some of the state’s treasured forests.

Massachusetts then looked east, to Maine, to find a route for the transmission line. Similar objections quickly arose, with opponents in the state filing a series of legal challenges. In 2021, Maine voters approved a ballot referendum effectively blocking the project. Work froze until August 2023, a few months after a jury unanimously ruled the project could move forward.

The delays spiked the project’s price tag. Before the line could start providing power, the developer, state regulators, and utilities had to come to an agreement about how those costs would be covered. In early 2025, they settled on terms that increased the price utilities would pay by a total of about $521 million, but ensured consumers would still see savings.

“The project faced many challenges over many years, and it survived all of them,” Turner said.

In addition to the modest monthly savings expected for Massachusetts utility customers, the influx of hydropower should keep rates down for consumers throughout New England by pouring lower-cost electricity into the market that will put downward pressure on prices, right at a time when rising energy bills have become a major issue, Turner said.

Questions remain, however, about how much new power the project will actually bring to the New England grid.

Hydro-Québec already sends power into the region on a separate transmission line, though these exports have decreased in recent years, even stopping almost entirely for a period in 2025. It’s possible that meeting its commitment to deliver along the New England Clean Energy Connect line will mean Hydro-Québec chooses to send less power along other pathways, said Dan Dolan, president of regional trade group the New England Power Generators Association. The net increase in clean power may be lower than anticipated.

“The change in flows over the last several years, particularly in 2025, do not leave me optimistic that Canadian hydro is here to save the day,” Dolan said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/NCEC-underway.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=98953b517535a0afc1f7c3fc200dc74e,N,,2026-01-12 08:13:49.296807

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2 percent in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.","DETROIT — General Motors plans to take a $6 billion charge to unwind some of its electric-vehicle investments, the latest carmaker to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a Jan, 8 regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor Co. announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM's writedown — a $4.2 billion cash charge — is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, which had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles.

“We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” the company said in its filing.

GM will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges this year as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but it expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

Souring bets

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on Sept. 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s largest and most profitable market. CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said last week that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

GM gained U.S. market share in 2025 on the strength of its gas-powered large pickups and SUVs, and its EVs, but some analysts have questioned the automaker's decision to focus on fully electric vehicles instead of hybrids.

""GM’s lack of hybrid exposure could partially reverse recent market share gains,"" CFRA equity analyst Garrett Nelson said in a research note on Thursday, citing the surging popularity of hybrid vehicles.

EV downturn

GM’s EV sales dropped 43 percent in the fourth quarter after the loss of the buyer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2 percent in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

The expansion concept study builds on the recently completed detailed engineering design of the company’s first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.
The concept study evaluated three investment scenarios with different modular configurations, ranging from NdFeB alloy powder production to fully integrated production including magnet finishing and packaging.
The plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create approximately 300 skilled manufacturing jobs.
Julian Treger, CoTec CEO, commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA’s Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform.""","Investing.com -- announced Monday that HyProMag USA has completed expansion concept studies and commenced pre-feasibility studies for plants in South Carolina and Nevada, marking a significant step toward tripling its domestic manufacturing capacity by 2029.

The expansion would increase total magnet and alloy production from 1,552 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) to 4,656 metric tons per year across three states, supporting the company’s scalable U.S. manufacturing strategy and reinforcing momentum toward a planned U.S. public listing.

The expanded developments show a post-tax Net Present Value (NPV) greater than $2 billion and a 38.7% real internal rate of return based on forecast market prices.

The expansion concept study builds on the recently completed detailed engineering design of the company’s first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.

The Texas Hub 2025 Detailed Design base case has a post-tax NPV of $409 million based on current market prices and $780 million based on forecast prices.

The pre-feasibility studies for the South Carolina and Nevada hubs will focus on site selection, saleable products, project configuration, site layout, permitting, logistics, and technical marketing.

The expansion targets increasing production capacity threefold by 2029 across the three hubs. The concept study evaluated three investment scenarios with different modular configurations, ranging from NdFeB alloy powder production to fully integrated production including magnet finishing and packaging.

Each site was envisioned as a brownfield development with no space or utility constraints. The project schedule assumes commissioning of three plants between 2027 and 2029 and does not include an expansion of the Texas Hub.

The plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create approximately 300 skilled manufacturing jobs. Plants in South Carolina and Nevada would be co-located with Intelligent Lifecycle Solution facilities, with expansions conditional on securing adequate feedstock and offtake.

An independent ISO-compliant study for the Texas Hub confirmed a low carbon footprint of 2.35 kg CO2-eq per kg of NdFeB sintered block product.

Julian Treger, CoTec CEO, commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA’s Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform.""

Will Dawes, Mkango CEO, added: ""HyProMag USA continues to develop a strong platform for further growth in the United States, and the recently completed Expansion Concept Study further validates the Company’s business model and strategic positioning.""

HyProMag USA is developing advanced rare earth magnet recycling and manufacturing operations to establish a secure domestic U.S. supply chain for NdFeB magnets, essential components for AI infrastructure, defense systems, robotics, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics.

Samsung Active Asset Management announced on January 12 that it will list the ""KoAct Hydrogen Power ESS Infrastructure Active"" ETF on January 13, which invests in leading domestic companies specializing in hydrogen power facilities and ESS.

Due to the rapid advancement of the AI industry, U.S. electricity demand has reached its limit. According to a report by Berkeley Lab, the average wait time for power grid connections at U.S. power plants has more than doubled from 2.3 years in the 2000s to 4.8 years in 2024. For big tech firms in urgent need of electricity, large-scale nuclear or gas power plants-which take 5 to 10 years to build-are not realistic alternatives.

""On-site power"" generation, which involves building dedicated power plants right next to data centers, is drawing attention. The main sources for on-site power are solar energy, ESS, and hydrogen fuel cells, all of which can be installed within a relatively short period-about a year or less.

The ESS market is experiencing rapid growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global cumulative installation of ESS is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 21.5% through 2035, far outpacing solar (12.7%) and wind (7.7%). With North America accounting for about 30-40% of the global ESS market, domestic companies are strengthening their export momentum in this region.

The hydrogen power sector is also expanding, as major U.S. companies like Bloom Energy continue to secure large-scale orders. Following the revision of the IRA last July, companies can now receive a 30% investment tax credit even when using low-cost fuel, reducing the cost of power generation and solidifying hydrogen as a practical power procurement method for big tech firms.

Korean companies stand to benefit from the strengthened overseas entity clause in the IRA. From 2026, to qualify for tax credits, the proportion of non-Chinese components must be significantly increased. As a result, domestic battery companies such as LG and Samsung are converting their U.S. production lines for ESS use, while companies like Vinatech and Koces have officially secured orders from Bloom Energy in the United States.

The KoAct Hydrogen Power ESS Infrastructure Active ETF offers a differentiated portfolio compared to existing secondary battery ETFs. Moving beyond battery materials, it includes a significant number of ESS-specialized equipment manufacturers such as Seojin System and Hanjung NCS, as well as fuel cell component companies like Vinatech and Koces. The ETF also covers the entire infrastructure spectrum, including Doosan Enerbility, which is developing 100% hydrogen power turbines, and HRSG (Heat Recovery Steam Generator) leaders such as BHI and SNT Energy.

Kim Hyosik, Team Leader of Investment Team 2 at Samsung Active Asset Management, stated, ""2026 will mark the first year in which the competition among U.S. big tech companies to secure power expands into the construction of on-site power infrastructure.

This 12th edition of the Annual Review is part of IRENA's extensive analytical work on the socio-economic impacts of a renewables-based energy transition.","Despite renewable energy installations hitting a new peak, jobs in the sector only increased by 2.3% from 2023, reaching 16.6 million in 2024. The newly released Renewable Energy and Jobs - Annual Review 2025 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) highlights the increasing impact of geopolitical and geoeconomic frictions, as well as growing automation, to the renewable energy workforce.

As in previous years, uneven development continues across the world. China remains the preeminent force in both deployment of generating capacities and equipment manufacturing, mainly due to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices.

In 2024, China created an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, or 44% of the global total. The EU followed suit with the same total as in 2023 at 1.8 million jobs. Brazil's renewables employment runs to 1.4 million, while India's and the United States' barely grew from around 1 million to 1.3 million and 1.1 million, respectively.

Commenting on this trend, IRENA Director-General, Francesco La Camera, said, ""Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side. Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain. The geographical imbalance of the job growth reminds us to get international collaboration back on track. Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community. This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socio-economic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition.""

In terms of employment by technology, solar photovoltaics (PV) retains the lead, owing to the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing plants. The industry employed 7.3 million people in 2024. Asian countries hosted 75% of the world's PV jobs with China garnering the bulk of the employment at 4.2 million.

Liquid biofuels follow after solar PV, creating 2.6 million jobs in 2024 with 46.5% of the total jobs generated in Asia. Hydropower came in third place with 2.3 million jobs, and wind follows with 1.9 million jobs. Beyond the numbers, this edition of the annual report underscores the need for more inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce. A just transition demands that no population groups such as women and people with disabilities are left at the margins. The renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives. To this day, both groups' potential remains under-utilised, which calls for deliberate, multifaceted and systemic action.

ILO Director-General, Gilbert F. Houngbo highlighted that ""A just transition to a renewables-based future must be grounded in inclusion, dignity, and equal opportunity. As countries scale up renewable energy investments and job creation, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that accessibility for persons with disabilities - who too often face barriers to inclusion in labour markets despite their skills, experience and talent - is built into every stage of policy design and implementation. This requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker's rights. Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice; it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development. By removing barriers to equality and promoting decent work, we strengthen economies and ensure that the energy transition truly works for all.""

Fostering a culture that respects diversity and upholds inclusion and fairness requires sustained, inclusive policy frameworks including accessible education and training, labour market services, and other measures. Designing and shaping such policies requires that all stakeholders have a seat at the table, especially those who are all too readily sidelined. Discriminatory practices and outdated social and cultural norms must be left in the past for the energy transition to truly drive more successful economies for all members of the community.

This 12th edition of the Annual Review is part of IRENA's extensive analytical work on the socio-economic impacts of a renewables-based energy transition. This is the 5th edition developed in collaboration with ILO.

This story has been updated with additional information.

By Will Atwater

In North Carolina, debates over how to regulate emerging water contaminants are moving from the lab to the policy arena — and this week, those debates could translate into binding policy. The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, which sets statewide water quality standards, is scheduled to meet Jan. 7-8 and is expected to finalize rules that limit the discharge of PFAS and other pollutants into state waterways.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances make up a class of 15,000 synthetic compounds often called “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment and resistance to breaking down. Used for decades in products like nonstick cookware, food packaging and stain-resistant fabrics, PFAS have been linked to immune suppression, developmental harm and certain cancers.

An emerging contaminant, microplastics, plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters — about the size of a pencil eraser — and even smaller nanoplastics are now considered ubiquitous in the environment. In the past few years, scientists have increasingly been able to detect these particles in water, food and human tissue, including organs such as the liver, kidneys and brain, raising new questions about how plastics move through the body.

Previously, PFAS and microplastics were studied as separate contaminants. But newer research suggests that real-world exposure rarely occurs that way. Studies increasingly show the two pollutants co-exist in water, food and the environment, where microplastics may carry or interact with other chemicals, and both can persist in living tissue. This realization has prompted calls for a more integrated approach to assessing environmental and human health risks.

As North Carolina and the nation brace for an active year of policy debates and new research on PFAS and microplastics, Frank Leibfarth, a UNC Chapel Hill chemistry professor and the university’s first recipient of the Blavatnik National Award for Young Scientists, is working at the intersection of both challenges. Leibfarth’s research focuses on designing advanced polymer materials and chemical processes to capture and destroy PFAS in drinking water, while also developing safer, more sustainable plastics aimed at reducing long-term environmental contamination.

In 2022, Leibfarth and Orlando Coronell, a UNC Chapel Hill environmental sciences and engineering professor, launched the NC Pure pilot Project to pilot test new materials designed to remove PFAS from public drinking water and wastewater systems as part of the North Carolina PFAS University Research Alliance. The work was funded by the North Carolina Collaboratory, a General Assembly initiative that coordinates research across the UNC System to support state and local government decision-making.

In late 2025, NC Health News spoke with Leibfarth about what the latest science reveals about PFAS and microplastics — and what questions researchers are still trying to answer.

North Carolina Health News: Can you share an update on the PFAS pilot testing?

Frank Leibfarth: We completed three pilot tests. One involved surface water from the Cape Fear River, which we conducted at [Cape Fear Public Utility Authority] Sweeney Water Treatment Plant. Another focused on groundwater drawn from the Pee Dee Aquifer and was carried out at [CFPUA’s] Richardson Drinking Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. The third took place at a wastewater facility in the Piedmont Triad. We also conducted pilot testing with Orange Water and Sewer Authority in Chapel Hill.

Leibfarth told NCHN that in addition to field pilots, his team is working with several utilities on bench-scale tests to evaluate how the materials perform under different treatment conditions.

NCHN: Beyond studying the liquids produced by landfills (called leachate), what other goals do you have for 2026?

Leibfarth: With the information that we’ve learned from the pilots and the feedback we’ve gotten from the utilities, we want to start at least two more pilots in order to solve specific problems that they’ve asked us to solve. Those are things like increasing the capacity of our resins for long chain PFAS, and implementing an on-site regeneration procedure that could be used by utilities and reduce overall costs.

NCHN: Many water utilities already rely on granular activated carbon systems to remove PFAS. What are the challenges in adding new treatment technologies without rebuilding entire systems?

Leibfarth: In 2026, we want to pilot ion exchange resins that are denser and could be used in combination with carbon. Most surface water plants, like Sweeney, will likely use carbon because it makes practical and economic sense. For utilities to adopt another technology, it has to fit into that existing infrastructure. No municipal treatment plant wants to tell customers they need a whole new building to make the technology work.

NCHN: One challenge utilities face is what happens to PFAS after filters are cleaned. How does that process work for granular activated carbon?

Leibfarth: For granular activated carbon filters, they send them to what are called reactivate facilities. That’s a thermal treatment process that reactivates a granular activated carbon so it can be used again.The information for how effectively [the process] destroys PFAS is still not known because the data isn’t released. That reactivation isn’t 100 percent, so, typically, new granular activated carbon has to supplement the reactivated material in order to bring the performance up to what it was.

NCHN: Let’s shift to plastic waste. In a recent Duke University study put a price tag on the societal costs of plastic pollution as much as $1 trillion yearly. What do you think about single-use plastics in that context?

Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free

Leibfarth: Plastics do have a huge societal cost, but plastics are often replacing something that would be used in their place. The real question is one of tradeoffs. There’s a well-known study comparing coffee cups that illustrates this tension. Over its lifetime, a porcelain mug can generate more greenhouse gas emissions than hundreds of disposable polystyrene cups, largely because porcelain is energy-intensive to manufacture and wash.

We need to reduce the amount of plastics that we make and use. There’s clearly huge opportunities to recycle plastics better and reuse them more. But the flip side of the coin is that plastics often save a tremendous amount of energy compared to alternatives.

NCHN: But much of that polystyrene still ends up discarded in the environment. How do you reconcile that?

Leibfarth: A flaw in the coffee cup example is that it doesn’t take into account the consequences of disposal, whereas the Duke study does. One challenge is that society currently materials for the most extreme use case. Think about a food truck — packaging is designed for someone who might drive 30 miles and want the food still hot. But most people walk up and eat right there. Do we really need all that excess material, or could we create incentives to use only the amount each use case requires? A lot of this comes down to how we think about using things, not just the material itself.

Large, complex problems like plastic pollution and climate change can be difficult for people to grasp at an individual level, Leibfarth noted. Studies that quantify environmental impacts, he said, help show how everyday choices — multiplied across millions of people — can add up to significant harm, even as he cautioned against simplistic narratives that frame all plastics as inherently bad.

The intersection of thermodynamics and economics is the realization that nearly all metrics of quality of life can be simplified to ever-increasing energy expenditure per capita. From horses to coal to fossil fuels, the efficient development and consumption of these fuels led the relatively small nations of Western Europe to transform into civilization-defining super and hyperpowers that have culminated in our 21st-century American experience.

This American way of life—and the quality of life it provides—is currently under siege by the ascendant Axis of Autocracy and its formalizing Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, et al (BRICS+) alliance against the Western liberal financial system. The downstream effects of this strategic challenge are seen in daily life across the United States, with supply chain bottlenecks, inflation, and rising debts and energy prices among a myriad of resultant and related social ills. Electricity prices, in particular, have been rising greatly in the United States, and the American power grid is an extremely complex system-of-systems that is under siege simultaneously by both the insatiable demands of hyperscaler data centers running artificial intelligence (AI) models and the threat of foreign actor meddling.

The solution to all of these challenges is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Mining for Grid Optimization

The understanding that the United States’ power grid needs a massive overhaul and expansion appears to have entered public consciousness. This scaling is already causing shuttered plants to reopen, and the nuclear power debate has finally receded to recognizing that nuclear generation is the ultimate path forward. These nuclear plants, and others, operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as the frictional costs of starting and stopping are too high. Bitcoin mining and miners can absorb the peaks and flatten the valleys in power demand, optimizing the performance of the American power grid to deliver uninterrupted electricity when and where it is needed. It is far easier to shutter and start mining rigs than to supply power.

The United States Army recently revealed the Janus Program, a next-generation nuclear power system to power military installations. Similar to civilian demands, military installations will experience peaks and troughs in demand that can be smoothed by public and/or private Bitcoin miners. This concept has already been floated by French politicians who are considering redirecting nuclear generation surpluses into cryptocurrency mining rather than traditional export sales to Germany.

Bitcoin Mining as a Strategic Advantage

Winning the 21st century is, and will further be, based on digitalization at scale, just as winning the 20th century was based on industrialization at scale. Artificial intelligence models have already outpaced hardware capabilities, and order backlogs at electrical grid suppliers measure in years. The Washington, D.C. establishment understands the importance of winning the artificial intelligence technology race with legislation for the CHIPS and GENIUS Acts, as well as the recent partial federal acquisition of domestic chip maker, Intel. These are unquestionably the right steps as winning the AI race and its impending merger with humanoid robotics will determine 21st-century hegemony.

It is now important to take these positive steps further and utilize Bitcoin mining as a means of securing American national security. Both public and private mining can unite to ensure that the majority of the global Bitcoin hashrate remains in the United States. This ensures that network control is grounded in small, free enterprise miners, rather than potentially being deceptively controlled by an opaque authoritarian regime. Space Force Officer Jason Lowery has called for a “strategic hashforce” to compete in an electrically based digital world. He notes that traditional competition and kinetic warfare are outdated, given the hyper-destructive nature of nuclear warfare and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). This view is shared by the author, who also notes that while competing to gain strategic access to Bitcoin, the United States can also build and fortify the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) as created by the current administration. This means that the inherent stock-to-flow advantages of the Bitcoin design will further enrich the United States, make the sovereign debt level more manageable, and ultimately lead to triumph over our peer competitors.

American adversaries already understand the potential of cryptocurrency mining and its impact on the electrical grid. Reports of Chinese targeting of American critical infrastructure have been reported for years; however, a recent 60 Minutes report highlighted that China has been building cryptocurrency mining data centers, illegal in the People’s Republic of China itself, in the United States with the dual capacity to conduct espionage and have the latent ability to disrupt the electrical grid. This problem is worsened by the fact that the mined Bitcoin is likely sent to Chinese-controlled wallets. This is of dual concern for the American economy and overall national security.

Recommendations

Below, I detail actionable steps that should be taken immediately to ensure American dominance of the 21st century.

Public-Private Partnerships for Grid Optimization through Bitcoin Mining

Bitcoin miners are eager to utilize cheap and abundant electricity—especially during periods of off-peak load for other applications. The Departments of War and Energy already understand the importance of energy in winning the AI race (not to mention other emergent high-demand needs such as electric cars), and Bitcoin mining can sit adjacent to this buildout to absorb excess and/or off-peak capacity. Project Janus was previously mentioned, and this is an excellent example of how excess electricity generated from military base-scale nuclear reactors can be cheaply sold to Bitcoin miners. This could even be further incentivized, as Bitcoin miners may pay a “sat tax”, which would be a production tax paid directly in Bitcoin, back to the government for the privilege of cheap sovereign power, which can then further fortify the SBR.

Encouragement of the Chinese Divestiture of Bitmain

Bitmain is the world’s leading manufacturer of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners, with a dominant market share of around 80 percent. It is also a Chinese company, so there is an understandable conflict of interest; however, a potential solution exists. The recent discussions of TikTok ownership changes and Intel public ownership examples offer very appealing solutions. In fact, the author’s recommendation is a combination of both solutions.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jievani-weerasinghe-NHRM1u4GD_A-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 01:58:22.897058

Focus was on further strengthening industry and government partnership, and sustaining and building momentum towards impactful delivery following the autumn 2025 launches of both the government Clean Energy Jobs Plan and the EUSG Skills Strategy 2025-30.

Meeting at the Midlands office of Energy & Utility Skills Group, the shared 2026 priorities focused on prioritised practical delivery, system engagement, and policy alignment that will support employers, people and communities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Early 2026 Priorities

The 7 January agenda focused on delivery, policy and strategy, and engaging the wider skills and employment system.

Delivery priorities were discussed and agreed as:

Establishing the North Sea Jobs Service to support workers transitioning from the oil and gas sectors into clean energy and wider industrial strategy roles.

Further strengthening the collaboration and partnership with the Department for Work and Pensions, which will see the first pilot cohort for the innovative sector entry programme that has been co-designed between industry and government and for which first pilot cohorts are planned to enrol this month.

Working to maximise responses to the testing phase for the proposed sector-wide digital platform. Working with employers, governments and partners across energy, water, and waste that marks a decisive step towards creating a world class workforce capability and national asset for one of the UK’s most critical sectors.

Policy and strategy priorities for early 2026 are:

To focus Social Inclusion Forum on maximising the partnerships between Energy UK, POWERful Women, and the Energy & Utility Skills Inclusion Measurement Framework. This work will include the continued amplification of best practice, innovation, and impact.

To deliver a sector attraction campaign from April 2026 and leverage the industry wide commitment to raise the profile of the sector and the diverse range of job and career opportunities across the clean energy sector.

Embedding fair work principles across skills, employment and procurement activity. This includes alignment with updated social value policy, application of workforce criteria within DESNZ grants and commercial activity, and a focus on job quality, workforce wellbeing and long term retention across the sector.

Immediate skills and employment system engagement priorities are:

To maximise the combined strengths of industry and government to respond to national consultations. A joint approach was agreed whereby both the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and the Energy & Utility Skills Group will seek to partner to maximise the strengths and capabilities of both organisations to best serve citizens, communities, employers and UK PLC.

The current focuses include: Finalising the sector’s response to the Department for Education consultation on Post-16 Level 3 and Below Pathways. Providing evidence to inform Migration Advisory Council Temporary Shortage List decision making. Apprenticeship reforms. Growth and Skills Levy policy development.

Get Involved

Future dates for the Social Inclusion Forum will be confirmed in February 2026. The Forum will now serve as the primary mechanism for employers, trade bodies and industry partners to engage in delivery that drives measurable improvement in social inclusion across the clean energy sector. Participation will support improved transparency through earlier ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting, stronger and more consistent workforce data, and accelerated progress in inclusive attraction and recruitment practice.

Global Power Plant Market size is expected to be worth around USD 403.1 Billion by 2034, from USD 220.9 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024 Asia Pacific held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 47.3% share, holding USD 104.1 Billion in revenue.

Captive power plants (CPPs) are on-site or dedicated off-site generating assets built primarily to supply electricity (and often steam/heat) to a specific industrial user. They are used when grid power is costly, unreliable, carbon-intensive, or when a plant needs stable quality power for continuous processes. In India, the regulatory idea of “captive” is tightly defined: under the Electricity Rules, at least 26% ownership must be held by the captive user(s) and at least 51% of the electricity generated (annual basis) must be consumed for captive use—conditions that determine whether the project qualifies for captive status and related charge exemptions.

Industrially, CPP adoption rises fastest in energy-intensive, always-on operations—food processing, dairies, cold chains, chemicals, metals, cement, textiles, and large campuses—where power interruptions directly translate into scrap, safety risks, and inventory losses. This urgency is reinforced by the scale of industrial energy demand: the industrial sector accounted for 37% (166 EJ) of global energy use in 2022, so even small reliability gains or tariff reductions have material bottom-line impact.

Key driving factors are strongly linked to operational risk and product integrity—especially in food value chains. Cold-chain interruptions can spoil inventory rapidly, so energy resilience becomes a core business requirement. India’s food-processing policy push is also adding throughput that must be powered reliably: the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI) runs from 2021–22 to 2026–27 with an outlay of ₹10,900 crore, and 172 food processing companies had been approved for assistance as of June 30, 2024. At the same time, cold-chain capacity gaps highlight why steady power matters: MoFPI’s annual reporting has cited a cold storage requirement of 61 million tonnes versus estimated existing capacity of about 32 million tonnes.

Policy is also pushing CPP strategies toward cleaner portfolios. India’s Ministry of Power notified the Green Energy Open Access Rules in June 2022, reducing the open-access threshold from 1 MW to 100 kW for green power, widening renewable procurement options for smaller industrial loads and enabling more hybrid “captive + open access renewables” structures. At the same time, India’s national direction is to scale non-fossil capacity to 500 GW by 2030, which increases grid renewable penetration and strengthens the business case for firming solutions around captive and contracted renewables.

Emerging Trends

Captive power is shifting to solar-plus-storage hybrids

A major latest trend in captive power plants is the move away from “one big generator” toward hybrid captive systems—typically solar paired with battery storage, backed by limited conventional generation only for critical needs. The reason is practical: industries want the reliability of captive power, but they also want lower fuel risk and a cleaner electricity profile. This shift is happening while power systems are getting tighter. The International Energy Agency reports global electricity demand rose by 4.3% in 2024, a much faster pace than 2023.

Food and beverage plants are a clear example of why the hybrid trend is gaining traction. These sites run continuous lines, refrigeration, and automated packaging where even short disruptions can create waste and lost output. At the same time, global food brands are now publishing hard numbers on renewable electricity, which increases internal pressure to “green” plant power. Nestlé says renewable electricity sourced in its manufacturing sites reached 95.3% by end-2024. PepsiCo reports that in 2024, 89% of its direct global electricity needs were met with renewable electricity, and its total electricity use was about 4,400 GWh—with roughly 96% purchased from the grid and the rest self-generated.

A second “latest trend” inside this shift is the rise of state-level rules that actively push storage into captive solar and tighten captive compliance. For example, a recent Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation (RRECL) standard operating approach for large captive solar and third-party sales highlighted battery energy storage expectations for projects above 5 MW, and reiterated captive thresholds such as 26% minimum equity ownership and 51% consumption of generated power to retain captive status.

Storage economics and grid charges are also moving in a supportive direction. Reuters reported that India extended a waiver on inter-state transmission charges for eligible energy storage projects until June 2028, and noted that inter-state transmission charges can add about 7% to monthly transmission costs for electricity purchasers. The same report referenced a ₹54 billion plan to develop 30 GWh of battery storage, and reiterated India’s 500 GW clean energy target by 2030.

Drivers

Reliable, predictable power for continuous production

For most industries, the biggest reason to build a captive power plant is simple: it gives a factory dependable electricity when interruptions or unstable supply can stop production. This matters even more for plants that run 24/7 or depend on tight temperature control. The global backdrop is also getting tougher—world electricity demand grew by 4.3% in 2024, and industry contributed nearly 40% of that growth, which increases competition for firm power and puts pressure on grids.

Food and beverage operations show why “uptime” has real financial value. The U.S. Department of Energy’s footprint analysis for Food & Beverage manufacturing (NAICS 311/312) estimates the sector uses 1,934 TBtu of primary energy, and electricity generation accounts for 906 TBtu (about 47%) of that total—highlighting how electricity-heavy processing, refrigeration, and packaging lines can be. When power is interrupted, the risk is not only lost throughput but also product safety and waste. U.S. food-safety guidance notes that a refrigerator keeps food safe for up to 4 hours during a power outage; beyond that window, many refrigerated perishables should be discarded.

Another part of the reliability story is cost predictability. Many large food companies are actively managing electricity sourcing to reduce exposure to price swings and strengthen resilience. Nestlé reports that by the end of 2024 it sourced 95.3% renewable electricity in its manufacturing sites, showing how energy strategy is now tied to operational risk and long-term planning. PepsiCo reports that in 2024, 89% of its direct global electricity needs were met with renewable electricity, while most electricity was still purchased through the grid—an example of why some sites still consider partial self-generation to protect critical operations.

Government policy can amplify this driver by making self-supply and green procurement easier. In India, the Green Energy Open Access Rules, 2022 are positioned as a step to help consumers access green power at reasonable rates and support national emissions goals.India’s captive framework also matters for industrial buyers: captive projects typically hinge on thresholds such as ≥26% ownership and ≥51% consumption of generated electricity for captive use.

Restraints

High upfront cost and rising compliance risk

A major restraint for captive power plants is that they demand big money upfront and then face a moving target on compliance. A factory is not just buying a generator—it is taking on a mini-utility job: land, engineering, fuel handling, emissions control, ash/waste, water systems, grid interconnection, and a full-time operations team. Even when a captive plant lowers outage risk, the payback can be uncertain if regulations tighten or if a cleaner alternative becomes easier to procure.

Fuel-price volatility is another practical headache, especially for gas-based captive units. The IEA notes that natural gas price volatility in Europe in 2024 was still 50% above the 2010–2019 average, and spot LNG volatility in Asia in 2024 remained 90% above its 2010–2019 average. That volatility flows directly into captive power costs because the plant is exposed to fuel procurement risk. The same IEA framing explains why power generation costs spiked globally in 2022—surging natural gas and coal prices sharply escalated the cost of producing electricity. In short, captive can protect a plant from grid tariff swings, but it can also “swap” that risk for fuel-market swings.

Environmental permitting and emissions controls can also slow projects and add recurring costs. In the U.S., facilities can trigger Title V operating permit requirements depending on size and location; EPA lists lower “major source” thresholds for non-attainment areas—down to 50 tpy, 25 tpy, or even 10 tpy for ozone-related classifications in some cases, which makes project design and siting more complicated.

EPA proposed in November 22, 2024 to strengthen NOx limits for many new or modified stationary combustion turbines, and held a public hearing on January 8, 2025—a sign that compliance expectations can tighten during a captive asset’s life. Globally, lenders also look for “good practice” design; World Bank Group/IFC thermal power guidance highlights typical stack height examples up to about 200 m for large coal plants and around 80 m for large oil-fired plants—details that often translate into real civil and permitting cost.

Food and beverage companies feel this restraint because their energy strategies are increasingly judged through a climate lens. Many large brands are moving electricity supply toward renewables, which can make fossil-heavy captive investments harder to justify internally. Nestlé says it reached 95.3% renewable electricity sourcing in its manufacturing sites by end-2024. PepsiCo reports that in 2024, 89% of its direct global electricity needs were met with renewable electricity, and its total electricity use was about 4,400 GWh, with roughly 96% purchased through the grid and only the remainder self-generated.

Opportunity

Hybrid renewable captive plants with storage for round-the-clock power

A clear growth opportunity for captive power plants is the shift from “fuel-only captive” to hybrid captive systems—on-site or off-site solar/wind tied with battery energy storage and smart controls. The business logic is straightforward: factories want the reliability of captive power, but they also want to cut emissions and reduce exposure to fuel volatility. At the same time, electricity demand is rising fast. The International Energy Agency reports global electricity demand grew by 4.3% in 2024, and industry contributed nearly 40% of the growth.

Food and beverage plants are a strong fit for this model because many of them cannot tolerate power interruptions or unstable voltage. They run continuous lines, refrigeration, boilers, compressed air, and automation—loads that are expensive to restart. Large food companies are also putting numbers behind their clean electricity push, which creates internal pressure to upgrade how plants are powered. Nestlé reports that by end-2024, 95.3% of electricity in its manufacturing sites was sourced from renewable electricity. PepsiCo reports its total electricity use in 2024 was about 4,400 GWh, and 89% of direct global electricity needs were met with renewable electricity; it also notes roughly 96% of electricity was purchased through the grid, with the remainder self-generated.

Government moves are making this opportunity easier to execute, especially in India where “captive” and “open access” structures are common for industry. The Ministry of Power notified the Green Energy Open Access Rules, 2022 on 06.06.2022 to accelerate renewable programs and improve access to affordable, reliable, and green energy. In May 2023, India’s PIB explained that the green open access threshold was reduced from 1 MW to 100 kW, widening who can buy renewable power through open access.

Storage policy is also becoming a tailwind. Reuters reported India extended the inter-state transmission charge waiver for eligible energy storage projects until June 2028, and referenced a ₹54 billion plan to develop 30 GWh of battery energy storage systems.Storage policy is also becoming a tailwind.

Energy Star, the popular Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program that appeared on the chopping block last year due to budget cuts, appears to be safe for at least another year.

As the federal government works through its next budget cycle, Politico reported that the appropriations committees for the House and Senate are expected to set aside $33 million for the program.

Energy Star is a program that rates products based on their energy efficiency. The program helps facility managers and executives feel confident that the systems and products they choose for their institutional and commercial facilities are the most energy efficient options available.

Though the reported money allotted to the program is less than the $36 million that was available last year, suggestions that Energy Star would be scrapped entirely were met with opposition from groups on both sides of the political aisles as well as manufacturing companies and environmental groups.

While Energy Star looks like it will survive another year, its future beyond 2026 is not as certain. When initial talk of the program being scrapped emerged, the belief was that EPA officials were interested in privatizing it.

Spotlight PA

HARRISBURG — Democrats and Republicans who lead the Pennsylvania Legislature have singled out increasing energy production as a goal for the year, as electricity prices rise and demand increases.

Consumers could feel an even greater squeeze in the years ahead, as utility companies predict that efforts to build data centers across the state to meet the artificial intelligence demand will worsen the crunch.

But environmental and labor advocates are skeptical that lawmakers can overcome partisanship in the state Capitol and take meaningful action.

That skepticism persists despite a major policy hurdle — which led to legal fights costing taxpayers more than $4.2 million — now being out of the way.

As a part of a $50.1 billion budget deal that resolved a four-month impasse, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and members of his party who control the state House agreed to pull out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The controversial interstate program would have capped the total amount of carbon emissions that some companies in Pennsylvania could emit and forced them to pay for each ton emitted.

Leaving RGGI was a major Republican goal. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, R-Indiana County, previously told Spotlight PA that his chamber was unlikely to move energy legislation until the state courts resolved a lawsuit regarding Pennsylvania’s entrance into the program.

With the program out of the way, Shapiro said he expects action.

“For years, the Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production. Today, that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “It is time now to look forward.”

Energy auctions in Pennsylvania offer a window into the challenge facing utility companies and consumers. The auctions are held by the operator of the state’s vast energy grid and are used to procure enough electricity for the future, and in recent years, prices have skyrocketed. In 2024, prices increased by more than 800% from the year prior. And at the December auction, energy prices hit a record high and would likely have increased further without a cap agreed to as part of legal action brought by Shapiro.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission also told consumers this past summer that the state saw “soaring power usage during multiple heat waves since mid-June and scorching conditions that pushed electricity demand on the regional power grid to its highest level in 14 years.” Supply and demand are the biggest factors in prices, an expert told Spotlight PA at the time.

Rob Routh, a lawyer and advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he’s watching the state Senate in particular to see if lawmakers are willing to move legislation that would increase renewable energy production or if the caucus will only support the natural gas industry.

“Are they just going to be ideologically fixed on one type of resource to generate electricity — gas?” Routh told Spotlight PA. “Are they willing to consider an all-of-the-above energy approach, or is it an explicit rejection of renewables?”

More energy on the table

Lawmakers’ proposals to increase energy production take many approaches — from speeding up permitting to adjusting tax credits. They’ve also focused on various industries, from solar to nuclear power.

Shapiro told reporters he wants to see state Senate Republicans pass his energy package, a slate of bills also known as the “Lightning Plan.”

It includes legislation that would amend some tax credits to benefit clean energy production, create a new board to streamline permitting for energy projects, and require electric companies to buy more renewable energy.

Another key part of Shapiro’s plan is to create a Pennsylvania-specific carbon cap-and-trade program, similar to RGGI. A majority of the payments from power producers to emit carbon dioxide — 70% — “would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bill,” according to the Shapiro administration.

Pittman has shot down that idea outright, saying that his caucus is not interested in supporting “any type of artificial cap-and-trade” program.

He has been more open to the other parts of the plan. He told Spotlight PA that revisiting the renewable energy standards “has merit,” and that the caucus is “willing to have a conversation over” the tax credit rewrites. These tax credits currently can be claimed by companies for a variety of purchases, including natural gas to manufacture petrochemicals, milk for dairy processing, and hydrogen fuel. Shapiro’s rewrite would include a new tax credit for clean energy producers.

“We would certainly be willing to have a conversation about any initiatives that help speed up projects in development so shovels get in the ground as soon as possible,” Pittman said.

Pittman said his caucus’s energy priorities include efforts “to enhance the use of our resources,” naming carbon capture as an example — a process through which carbon emissions are contained before they reach the atmosphere and are injected into deep underground wells. The waste can also be used to drill for more oil.

He also talked about speeding up efforts “to lower the taxes on job creators,” and issuing permits more quickly. However, he did not name specific legislation that he would support in the new year.

“I really think the best approach is to be as nimble and inviting as possible, to not try to have government programs and government initiatives artificially attempt to drive the marketplace,” Pittman told Spotlight PA days after the final budget deal.

Renewable energy, not climate protection

State House Democrats have proposed a range of legislation to lower barriers to increasing renewable or low-carbon energy sources, such as requiring that new warehouses be built to be compatible with solar panels and reducing permitting fees for small nuclear power plants.

Both the state House and Senate have passed bills that touch on solar energy with bipartisan support in recent years, although they had different goals.

Last session, the state House passed a proposal that would allow third parties to operate community solar energy facilities, which consumers could opt into. The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The bill was reintroduced last year but hasn’t been considered by either chamber.

Last summer, the state Senate passed a measure that would tighten oversight of Pennsylvania’s growing solar energy industry to help ensure that solar panels are properly decommissioned and all waste is properly disposed of. The requirements would not apply to homes and businesses that use solar panels to “generate electricity for their own use,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The full state House has not taken it up.

Katie Blume, legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, doubts that Democrats and Republicans will push energy bills to the finish line.

She pointed to other unresolved disagreements, including the regulation of slotlike skill games, that both parties have agreed are priorities but have been unable to advance.

“Why should I have faith in the Senate to do anything on energy, let alone affordability, when they can’t even figure out skill games in their own caucus?” Blume told Spotlight PA.

Rob Bair, chair of the Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, which represents many unionized workers who build power plants, echoed Blume’s concern. Bair said lawmakers will have to compromise and bolster both natural gas and solar, industries that are often pitted against each other.

“Everyone understands we need to do it,” Bair said of increasing power generation in the state. “But we are watching everything closely to see if the chambers can actually come together.”

Environmental protection bills have even worse odds of passing the General Assembly, said state Rep. Greg Vitali, D-Delaware County, at a December advisory committee meeting on climate change issues.

Vitali said that the “political reality” in the Capitol is that legislators have to focus on proposals that are in conformance with “labor and labor jobs.”

“Climate isn’t among the top five issues of legislators,” Vitali said. “There’s a need for leadership. … They have to do more than introducing bills and paying lip service.”

Data centers on deck

Lawmakers have also singled out data centers as a major reason to increase energy production in the state.

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build out data centers in Pennsylvania. These facilities require huge amounts of both energy and clean water — the latter is used to cool the campuses. One projection estimates that global energy demand will increase by up to 165% by the end of the decade because of AI.

At the same time, Pennsylvania’s grid operator — PJM Interconnection — is seeing record-high prices at energy auctions. Those higher prices trickle down to consumers, according to utilities.

The most recent energy auction hit the price cap negotiated by Shapiro and the grid operator, and still failed to procure the amount of energy PJM had targeted.

Pittman has also identified data centers as a key cause for increasing energy production in the state. Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.

“The best way to protect consumers with the advent of data centers is to make sure supply meets demand,” Pittman said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “We want to see responsible growth of data centers. We want to see responsible growth of power supply.”

Any energy-related legislation will likely be referred to the state Senate’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and its chair, Gene Yaw, R-23, Loyalsock Twp., said he doesn’t think more renewable energy is the answer.

“Renewable energies and data centers, they don’t go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power. And renewable power — it’s intermittent and of limited duration at best.“

Routh, the advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said gas plants have their own limitations and argued that Yaw’s comments ignore the effectiveness of battery storage technology for renewable energy.

Still, he called the data center issue “top of mind for legislators and their constituents,” and said there’s potential for state House Democrats and Senate Republicans to collaborate on regulating their energy usage.

He pointed to a bipartisan agreement in the state budget deal related to the PUC, which oversees utilities across Pennsylvania. The legislation, which is now law, allows the agency to review and validate utility companies’ predictions to PJM of the amount of electricity needed — those estimates help set costs for consumers.

​​Routh said one bill he’s keeping an eye on would direct the commission to draft regulations to oversee data centers and prevent spikes in electricity costs.

“It’s a new issue. It’s the key driver for why people’s electric bills are going to be going up in Pennsylvania,” Routh said. “There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”

Legislation rejects drastic Trump cuts and 80+ extreme Republican riders—protecting key investments in America’s small businesses and reasserting Congress’ control over key spending decisions

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees released text of two bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Financial Services and General Government and the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs bills.

In a statement, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said:

“President Trump has pushed to eviscerate key investments in our small businesses and America’s global leadership—but because Democrats were at the table, this package rejects his truly extreme plan, protecting essential funding for communities nationwide and reasserting congressional control over key spending decisions.

“While President Trump pushed to slash investments in our small businesses and funding for community development to help local economies nationwide grow, Democrats successfully protected these resources. Democrats fought off Republicans’ extreme riders and secured a much-needed funding boost to protect Americans’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel by ensuring there is sufficient funding for federal defenders in the coming year.

“This compromise legislation rejects President Trump’s decimation of America’s foreign assistance programs and provides critical investments to save lives, reduce conflict, and strengthen our alliances and our national security. The bill supports key investments in global health, rejects this administration’s proposed retreat from international organizations, and strengthens oversight and transparency measures.

“These were tough negotiations under extremely challenging circumstances, and while I strongly disagree with some of the difficult spending decisions that were ultimately made, there is no doubt in my mind that this bipartisan compromise is a significantly better outcome than another yearlong continuing resolution that provides President Trump with slush funds and more power—and that fails to address urgent problems. Passing these bills will help ensure Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decide how taxpayer dollars are spent.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country. The $76.3 billion package:

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. These bills provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent, and they strengthen key oversight, accountability, and transparency measures to help ensure that Congress—not the executive branch—decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects scores of extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—including over 70 poison pill riders in the FSGG bill alone, like measures to restrict access to reproductive care and prevent the IRS from creating a free tax filing program.

SUPPORTS SMALL BUSINESSES: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding to invest in America’s small businesses, instead providing $1.25 billion for the Small Business Administration and the grants and loans it provides to communities nationwide.

INVESTS IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: Rejects President Trump’s proposal to slash funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund by 59%, as well as House Republicans’ proposed 15% cut—protecting current funding and ensuring adequate staffing levels to administer the Fund.

SUPPORTS PUBLIC DEFENDERS: Provides a much-needed 22% increase in funding ($1.766 billion) for Federal Defenders to reimburse panel attorneys who make up 40% of the federal defender workforce and help protect Americans’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel in criminal proceedings.

REJECTS CATASTROPHIC FOREIGN ASSISTANCE CUTS: Rejects President Trump and House Republicans’ most extreme cuts to investments in foreign assistance and America’s global leadership. The bill provides $19 billion more in funding than President Trump’s request—and $3.8 billion more than House Republicans’ bill.

When Phil Murphy first ran for Governor in 2017, Clean Water Action made its endorsement based on the following policy commitments.

Stop raiding the Clean Energy Fund to increase funding for energy efficiency programs and especially provide environmental justice (EJ) communities the capacity to access new local jobs and revenue generation in the clean energy economy.

Prioritize port infrastructure projects that reduce diesel emissions and related adverse health impacts in ports adjacent EJ communities.

Use comprehensive cumulative impact analysis tool to inform state programs, project future needs, and give a meaningful voice to EJ communities in decision-making processes.

Put New Jersey on a path to a 100% clean energy economy by 2050 with an announcement of a clean energy and jobs agenda within his first 100 days and new state Energy Master Plan in 2018, with targets of 3,500 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind generation by 2030 enough power for 1.5 million homes, 600 MW of clean energy storage by 2021 with a goal of 2000 MW deployed by 2030, while making sure EJ communities are 100% part of the plan and its implementation.

When Governor Murphy came up for re-election in 2021, Clean Water Action considered his first term accomplishments and endorsed him for a second term. Highlights include but are not limited to:

Signed landmark environmental justice law (2020) that requires facility permits to reduce emissions and/or deny new permits in already overburdened communities, as well as create a process for community input.

Established precedent setting 2020 laws including ban single use plastic bags, Styrofoam with straws offered by request and managing some sources of food waste through centralized composting facilities.

Stopped several, but not all, fossil fuel projects including the PennEast pipeline and NESE gas pipelines (but later allowed in 2025) as well as proposed frack gas power plants in the Meadowlands.

Passed Electric Vehicle bill (2020) with consumer rebates and bus mandates.

National leader on offshore wind -- 7500 MW and created NJ windport, manufacturing and jobs.

Ban all facets of fracking in the Delaware Basin.

Require drinking water lead service lines to be replaced statewide within 10 years, or by 2031.

Adopted strictest PFOA/PFOS standard for drinking water (2020) in the nation. Piloting treatment systems in selected locations and plan to expand protection efforts in the future.

Adopted Advanced Clean Truck Rule (2021) which increased sales of electric trucks.

There were additional commitments made to: update the Energy Master Plan, fast-track and strengthen NJDEP PACT (Protection Against Climate Threats), Inland Flood Protection and REAL rules, and create sustainable funding source for NJ Transit and end Clean Energy Fund raid.

================

Reality of Governor Murphy’s Environmental Legacy

Governor Murphy got out of the gate quite strong on an energy, green jobs and environmental justice (EJ) agenda. He created the framework for action – 100% clean energy by 2050, later made a more urgent goal of 100% clean energy by 2035.

But his ability to succeed was partially hindered by his slowness to make critical and good appointments happen (e.g. Pinelands Commission) and slowness to finalize strong, clear plans and updated policies/regulations (e.g. Inland Flood Protection rules, NJPACT-REAL rules, Energy Master Plan). His rocky relationship with the legislature and other political pressures/missteps also hampered his ability to control his agenda, govern and establish a fairer budget.

Additionally, no one could have foreseen the devastating impacts of the Covid pandemic, economic downturn, rising interest rates, re-election of Trump, corresponding loss/uncertainty of federal funding and policy reversals (e.g. All NJ Offshore Wind projects cancelled.). So there is no knowing if Governor Murphy could have accomplished more if these destabilizing conditions had not occurred.

Even when good policies were signed into law, the strength of those policies was largely due to collective, consistent and intense grassroots pressure both at the legislature and administration (e.g. Environmental Justice law, Inland Flood rule).

While the Governor Murphy’s chief accomplishments have already been mentioned, below are some of our disappointments and mixed reviews.

While he denied several fossil fuel projects (PennEast pipeline and Meadowlands/NJTransit power plants), he approved the PVSC gas plant in Newark despite 3 other powerplants nearby and new EJ law and NESE pipeline even after it had been declined 3 times previously.

Despite saying “I will fix NJ Transit if it kills me”, he did not create a sustainable source of funding, kept raiding capital budget for operating expenses as well as the Clean Energy Fund. To his credit, there are more bus operators and train engineers trained and licensed. NJTransit fares were frozen for a number of years. But, equipment failures, delays and cancellations of routes/rides and heat related shutdowns of train lines are still common.

Little progress on electrifying transit bus fleet (100% of purchases by 2032), currently less than 10 buses (in Camden) operating; On the positive side, secured funds to upgrade Wayne and Meadowlands bus depots and charging infrastructure for both cars and trucks along major traffic corridors under the NEVI program.

Continue to subsidize PSEG’s nuclear plants by $300 million per year despite years when conditions did not warrant BPU’s approval.

Only after intense public pressure were the Inland Flood Protection rules issued. This was after long delays, many rewrites and despite recent devastation of Hurricane Ida. The REAL rules have still not been formally adopted.

Issued good but unenforceable warehouse siting guidance, but no tangible progress on diesel or zero emissions policies at these facilities (e.g. Indirect Source Review).

Mikie Sherrill: Our Next Governor

Committed to Polluter Pays & Public Health Protections

Mikie Sherrill has been a longtime partner of Clean Water Action, sharing core values of people, action, justice and affordability. As Sherrill transitions into her new role as Governor, Clean Water Action plans to work with her and her administration on critically important efforts that will continue New Jersey’s leadership as a national standard setter for environmental justice and protections for all of its residents regardless of their zip code or economic status.

The following are highlights of environmental policies, practices and funding priorities that Mikie Sherrill committed to Clean Water Action if elected Governor:

Believes NJ needs to continue to take strong action against polluters, holding them accountable for the harm they cause our communities, particularly communities that have for too long have disproportionately faced the health and environmental consequences of polluters

Clean Water Action is calling on her to make polluters pay for their climate damages by signing Climate Superfund Act, now entitled “Polluters Pay for a More Affordable New Jersey Act”, into law and ensuring quick implementation.

Fully enforce NJ’s 2020 Environmental Justice law and corresponding regulations.

Clean Water Action played a primary role in its passage and rulemaking.

Strongly believes that our incarcerated populations deserve clean drinking water.

This is in line with Clean Water Action’s Safe Water Safe Lives Initiative and Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated Persons.

Strongly supports continuing the state’s critical work in replacing lead service lines - deadline for replacing all of NJ’s residential lines is 2031.

Would take steps to address the presence of toxics in personal care and beauty products which are disproportionately more dangerous in products marketed to women of color.

Clean Water Action has a new legislative package of bills that address PFAS is menstrual products and apparel, as well as carcinogens in hair products. Expanding efforts with utilities to keep PFAS out of water supplies as well as ensure implementation of existing stricter PFAS drinking water standards and treatment.

Strongly believes that NJ can be a leader in medium/heavy duty truck electrification...NJ needs a cleaner fleet to reduce harmful emissions, reduce long term health care costs in our communities ...as quickly as possible.

Clean Water Action is a lead advocate of Indirect Source Review legislation or regulation that would move ports and warehouses towards zero emissions faster. We support Sherrill’s call for a warehouse moratorium.

Supports Skip the Stuff (S3195/A5157) which calls on businesses and institutions to provide single use disposable food service items only upon request.

This bill recently passed into law and now requires implementation. Complementary policies are being introduced for the 2026-7 legislative session to further reduce plastic waste, packaging and related toxins.

Committed to ensuring that NJTransit’s capital and operating budgets have sustainable long-term funding to make service as convenient and accessible as possible, get cars off our highways and reduce emissions in our communities.

Upgrade NJTransit’s existing garages, invest in charging infrastructure and workforce development needed to service electric buses.

Diversion of NJ’s Clean Energy Fund is unacceptable, particularly as federal funds dry up. Clean Water Action has been a tireless advocate to end diversions.

Top priority would be to upgrade our electric grid to ensure that we are able to take on new sources of clean energy; make investments in community solar.

Clean Water Action is seeking addition of truly green & clean (non-nuclear nor hydrogen) in-state energy and jobs; promotion of community solar; rejection of any additional fossil fuel infrastructure or power plants.

Opposes OPRA rollbacks that reduced transparency and accountability of state government. Clean Water Action is part of a larger good government coalition.

Apply congressional experience and knowledge to securing federal dollars as she has done in the past for infrastructure ($60 million BIA), PFAS ($2.8 million), brownfields remediation and more.

Continue commitment to being a strong presence against the current Federal efforts to dismantle environmental protections and funding.",https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/clean-water-action.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 23:13:17.411199

Incorporating instream flow uses into municipal water supply planning efforts can provide numerous public benefits. This article discusses the framework and opportunity for collaborative instream flow protection in municipal water supply operations.

Colorado’s instream flow program is a dynamic approach to protecting the natural environment that encourages practical and creative solutions to evolving environmental concerns. While water rights typically involve diverting water from the stream, the instream flow program protects water in the stream. Environmental values associated with instream flow uses can work synergistically with municipal water supply operations to realize several public benefits, such as improved water quality, riparian health, urban cooling, resiliency, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic value. As illustrated by the examples discussed later in this article, the instream flow program can facilitate cooperative agreements with municipal water providers for shared beneficial use of our state’s most precious resource.

Water Rights and the Prior Appropriation Doctrine in Colorado

The prior appropriation doctrine governs the ownership and use of water and water rights in Colorado. In simple terms, the prior appropriation system is described as “first in time, first in right.” A water user that has demonstrated an intent to put water to beneficial use first has a vested and prior right to use water in that amount against subsequent water users. This system developed out of necessity during the colonial expansion westward and was influenced by Spanish settlers and early miners to allocate water in the arid environment of Colorado, as an alternative to the more common riparian system of water rights based on land ownership abutting water ways.1

The prior appropriation doctrine has been enshrined in the Colorado Constitution. Article XVI, § 5 dedicates water in Colorado as public property for use by the people, subject to appropriation, and § 6 gives the right to appropriate water for beneficial use in priority.2 The 1969 Water Rights Determination and Administration Act (1969 Act) provides the legal framework for surface and tributary ground water distribution and use under the prior appropriation doctrine.3

An appropriation of a water right under the 1969 Act, as originally codified, meant “the diversion of a certain portion of the waters of the state and the application of the same to a beneficial use.”4 Similarly, beneficial uses were limited to diversions of water from the stream system for extractive uses such as domestic or municipal, irrigation, and manufacturing or industrial activities.5 Environmental uses of water, including instream flows, were not initially addressed in the 1969 Act but were later incorporated through amendments.6

Colorado Instream Flow Program

The Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) was first established by the Colorado legislature in 1937 to protect and develop Colorado’s water resources for the benefit of present and future generations.7 It was not until the national environmental movement in the late 1960s, however, that discussions regarding the value of instream flows and role of the CWCB in the protection of such flows began to garner serious attention and focus.8 In 1973, those discussions culminated in the passage of SB 97 to create the Colorado Instream Flow and Natural Lake Level Program.9 SB 97 was unprecedented at the time and amended the 1969 Act to define beneficial use of a water right to include use by the CWCB for protection of stream flows within a specified reach without a diversion of water from the stream.10

Under the instream flow program, the CWCB has exclusive authority to hold a water right for instream flow uses in Colorado and may appropriate water rights or acquire existing water rights for instream flow, provided that it determines that such water rights are necessary to preserve or improve the natural environment to a reasonable degree.11 Since the program’s inception, the CWCB has appropriated nearly 1,700 instream flow rights across 9,700 miles of stream and completed over 35 water acquisition transactions.12

The General Assembly has reinforced and expanded the CWCB’s ability to acquire water rights for instream flow purposes on several occasions.13 Acquiring and changing senior water rights for instream flows in over-appropriated systems can add great value by preserving the priority date, and therefore the availability, of the water for greater instream flow protection.14 Acquisitions can be donated to or purchased by the CWCB, and the statutory language specifically anticipates potential acquisitions from governmental entities, like municipalities.15 Other free-market developments to the Colorado instream flow program enacted by the state legislature over the years include streamlined processes for loans of water rights for instream flow use, instream flow protection for mitigation releases, and stream flow augmentation plans.16 These developments provide additional opportunities for water users, including municipalities, to participate in the program in support of instream flows.

In addition to implementing the instream flow program, the CWCB is tasked with creating the Colorado Water Plan, which addresses the state’s water challenges through collaborative water planning, including expanded opportunities for instream flow protection.17

Case Studies Along the Front Range

The instream flow program provides reasonable protection of the environment for benefit of the public and is emphasized in the Colorado Water Plan as a balanced approach to addressing environmental needs in the face of climate change.18 Similarly, municipal water service providers, acting in the interest of their respective jurisdictions, must often balance water supply with other public interests. Municipal water projects and water supply planning efforts can be designed to address multiple needs and related uncertainties across a jurisdiction, informed by integrated planning efforts. The various public interests typically considered by municipalities may align with instream flow protection in many respects. The Colorado Water Plan includes several policy considerations that highlight this potential overlap between municipal water interests and instream flows.19

Fundamentally, the Colorado Water Plan encourages a holistic, collaborative approach to water management that balances multiple uses and benefits to meet water shortages throughout the state.20 As competition for water resources in Colorado becomes more pronounced with increased demands and costs, the benefits of water sharing and collaboration will also likely increase.21 The Colorado Water Plan focuses on thriving watersheds as an action area to support stream health, recreational uses, resiliency, erosion control, and water quality, all of which provide tangible benefits to municipal water service providers.22 Accordingly, more water in the stream system for instream flows can be a natural complement to a municipality seeking to balance growing water demands with related public interests. The following examples demonstrate how instream flow uses can benefit municipal water supply, and vice versa, to realize this balance in a meaningful way.

Boulder Creek Instream Flow Project

The Boulder Creek instream flow project is a long-standing cooperative project that has been operating in Boulder County for almost 35 years. This project has operated successfully due in large part to the partnership between the City of Boulder and the CWCB and their collaboration with neighboring water users in Boulder County to support environmental stream flows and other uses in the creek.

In the early 1990s, Boulder donated a suite of valuable senior water rights to the CWCB to establish a year-round instream flow program on North Boulder and Boulder Creeks.23 The acquisition was memorialized in a series of donation agreements between Boulder and the CWCB pursuant to CRS § 37-92-102(3), following certain legislative amendments throughout the 1980s that clarified and enhanced the CWCB’s acquisition authority for instream flows.24 Boulder and the CWCB, as co-applicants, also received a water court decree to change the use of the donated rights to include instream flow uses for the project.25

The Boulder Creek instream flow project protects three segments from below the Silver Lake Reservoir near the headwaters of North Boulder Creek down to 75th Street in Boulder County (see fig. 1). The donated rights include reservoir releases, bypassed diversions, and changed irrigation ditch shares to support instream flows throughout the year. As part of its donation to the CWCB, Boulder retained the right to use water available under the donated rights (1) for municipal purposes under certain conditions, including drought and emergency conditions in its municipal water supply operations; (2) for municipal purposes anytime they are not needed to meet instream flow amounts; and (3) for beneficial reuse downstream of the protected reaches.26 This provides operational flexibility for the city’s municipal water supply while also supporting instream flow uses by the CWCB in most years. Its participation in the Boulder Creek instream flow program has also helped the city address US Forest Service regulatory requirements for bypasses related to its diversions from North Boulder Creek as part of federal permitting for one of its raw water pipelines.27

The City of Boulder has a long-standing environmental ethos that incorporates instream flows into its water supply planning and operations. Boulder’s water supply planning documents from the 1980s identified the goal of supporting instream flows in Boulder Creek to enhance aquatic and riparian ecosystems, reflecting city planners’ prediction that dry-up periods in the creek would become more severe and frequent with increased water demands.28 Subsequent Boulder water supply and land use planning documents have included similar goals focused on balancing instream flows and environmental preservation with municipal water demands and operations, and emphasizing the connection between stream health and reliable drinking water supplies.29

Because the protected stream segments run through the Boulder city limits, and extend both above and below the city, the project benefits water quality, riparian health, and resiliency in the Boulder municipal watershed and water system operations and provides additional environmental benefits to the larger Boulder County community.

Gross Reservoir Environmental Pool Project

The cities of Boulder and Lafayette entered into an intergovernmental agreement in 2010 with Denver Water to establish a 5,000 acre-foot environmental pool in an enlarged Gross Reservoir to augment stream flows in South Boulder Creek.30 Boulder recognized the need to address low flows on South Boulder Creek as a key goal in its planning documents and identified Denver Water’s planned expansion of Gross Reservoir as an opportunity to use upstream storage to establish a robust instream flow program. Lafayette similarly identified Gross Reservoir for potential water storage in its water rights decrees, providing both a water supply and environmental benefit to its operations. The parties proactively agreed to cooperate to mitigate the reservoir expansion’s impacts to aquatic resources in the South Boulder Creek basin by creating and operating the environmental pool.31

Coordinated with municipal water system operations, releases from the environmental pool will allow Boulder and Lafayette to store their decreed water rights for later release to meet specific target flows below Gross Reservoir in South Boulder Creek throughout the year. The segments identified for the target flows include Gross Reservoir to South Boulder Road (Upper Segment, depicted as segments 1 and 2 in fig. 2) and South Boulder Road to the confluence with Boulder Creek (Lower Segment, depicted as segment 3 in fig. 2).32 The agreement also includes provisions to address emergencies such as extended drought or an unexpected problem with water storage, conveyance, or treatment infrastructure to allow for flexibility in operations to meet both target flows and municipal needs.

Boulder’s releases from the environmental pool are protected as instream flows according to a Water Delivery Agreement with the CWCB dated September 9, 2019, and a water court decree entered for Boulder, Lafayette, and the CWCB.33 Water released by Boulder to meet the target flows will be protected for instream flow uses to the extent that such flows do not exceed the amounts that CWCB has determined to be appropriate to preserve the natural environment to a reasonable degree in South Boulder Creek. Boulder’s target flow releases will support CWCB’s existing appropriated instream flow rights up to the specified amounts (see fig. 2). Boulder may then redivert the water downstream of the protected reaches for its municipal uses.

The environmental pool will provide permanent, dedicated storage for water rights owned by Boulder and Lafayette to be released to enhance stream flows in South Boulder Creek prior to downstream uses for municipal purposes by the parties. These operations provide added flexibility, resiliency, and redundancy to the cities’ respective water supply systems. In turn, the enhanced stream flows will benefit 17.3 miles of South Boulder Creek, including Eldorado Canyon State Park, South Boulder Creek Natural Area, and City of Boulder open space lands, and will support native fish populations and riparian and wetland habitats.

Conclusion

By integrating water supply planning with a holistic approach to water development and management that provides multiple public benefits, municipalities can become strong partners with the CWCB. Together, they can help protect instream flows and balance growing water demands and future uncertainties with the environmental values that make Colorado a beautiful place to live.

Roaring Fork Club, LLC, 351 P. 3d 442 (Colo. 2015), ruling that a diversion from a steam for private instream flows is a “forbidden right” contrary to the prior appropriation doctrine; only the CWCB, with strict limitations identified by the general assembly, can hold an instream flow right for the benefit of the public.

Legislation enacted in 2002 expanded the Colorado instream flow program to provide that water rights may also be used by the CWCB to improve the natural environment (and not just for preservation purposes).

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

In practice, they warn, countries lacking legal mechanisms to recognize customary land rights may default to state-led models that repeat earlier injustices.

The paper argues that conservation cannot be sustainable if it undermines basic human rights, including rights to land, culture, and self-determination.
Education, finally, involves confronting conservation’s own history and recognizing knowledge systems that exist outside Western scientific traditions.","Conservation often presents itself as a technical enterprise: how much land to protect, which species to prioritize, what policies deliver results. A recent paper in Nature argues that this framing misses something fundamental. Many of the field’s most persistent failures, the authors contend, cannot be understood without confronting how race, power, and historical exclusion continue to shape conservation practice today.

The paper, A Framework for Addressing Racial and Related Inequities in Conservation, does not claim that conservation is uniquely flawed, nor that injustice is universal across all projects. Its argument is narrower and more pointed. Modern conservation, it says, emerged from a colonial context that treated land as empty and people as obstacles. Those assumptions were never fully dismantled. They survive in subtler forms, influencing whose knowledge counts, who bears the costs of protection, and who decides what success looks like.

The authors, led by Moreangels Mbizah of Wildlife Conservation Action in Zimbabwe, trace conservation’s institutional roots to the late nineteenth century, when protected areas were established across colonized landscapes through forced removals and restrictions on customary land use. Indigenous peoples and rural communities were often excluded in the name of preserving “pristine” nature. Although conservation has evolved since then, the paper argues that these early patterns still shape present-day practice through what it calls “path dependencies”: inherited norms that continue to privilege outside expertise and centralized control.

One consequence, according to the authors, is the persistent marginalization of Indigenous peoples and local communities, particularly in the Global South. These groups are frequently described as “stakeholders” or “beneficiaries” rather than rights-holders with authority over their lands. The language may sound neutral, the paper suggests, but it often masks unequal power relationships. Even well-intentioned projects can reproduce older hierarchies if communities are consulted only after priorities are set, or if participation is limited to implementation rather than decision-making.

The paper pays particular attention to the current push to expand protected areas to cover 30% of the planet by 2030. In principle, the authors argue, this target could support more pluralistic forms of conservation, including Indigenous-managed territories and community conservancies. In practice, they warn, countries lacking legal mechanisms to recognize customary land rights may default to state-led models that repeat earlier injustices. Conservation success, measured narrowly through ecological indicators, can come at high social cost when human rights are treated as secondary concerns.

Another theme the authors examine is the way conservation narratives value animals and people. Campaigns aimed at audiences in Europe and North America often focus on the moral worth of individual animals, sometimes in ways that implicitly devalue the lives of people who live alongside wildlife. When human–wildlife conflict results in injury or death, local suffering may receive little attention, while the killing of a charismatic animal can provoke global outrage. The authors argue that such asymmetries are not incidental; they reflect deeper processes of “othering” that shape whose lives are seen as grievable or deserving of protection.

The paper is careful not to frame these dynamics as purely racial in a narrow sense. Instead, it emphasizes intersections of race, class, geography, and political power. Urban elites in low-income countries, the authors note, may exercise authority over rural communities in ways that mirror global North–South inequalities. Conservation led by local actors is not automatically just. What matters is how power is distributed and whether affected communities retain meaningful agency.

To address these patterns, the authors propose what they call the RACE framework: Rights, Agency, Challenge, and Education. The framework is not presented as a checklist or a universal solution. Rather, it is intended as a lens through which conservation organizations, researchers, and funders might examine their own practices.

Rights, in this framing, are foundational. The paper argues that conservation cannot be sustainable if it undermines basic human rights, including rights to land, culture, and self-determination. Agency follows from this: communities must have real authority over decisions that affect their territories, not merely advisory roles. Challenge refers to the obligation, particularly among powerful institutions and individuals, to speak out when conservation practices cause harm or exclusion. Education, finally, involves confronting conservation’s own history and recognizing knowledge systems that exist outside Western scientific traditions.

The authors stress that this is not about revisiting past wrongs for their own sake. Understanding history, they argue, is necessary to avoid repeating it under new banners. Nor is the framework framed as an attack on conservation itself. On the contrary, the paper insists that conservation outcomes are likely to be stronger when communities closest to the land are recognized as stewards rather than obstacles.

There is a pragmatic strand running through the analysis. Conservation, the authors note, increasingly operates in a politically fragmented world, with declining public funding and growing skepticism toward international institutions. Projects that lack local legitimacy are more vulnerable to conflict and reversal. Addressing inequities, in this sense, is not only an ethical concern but also a strategic one.

The paper does not pretend that change will be easy. Power, once accumulated, is rarely surrendered voluntarily. Nor does it suggest that conservation can resolve broader social injustices on its own. Its claim is more modest, and perhaps more demanding: that conservation must stop treating inequality as an external issue and recognize how deeply it is woven into the field’s own structures.

For a discipline accustomed to measuring success in hectares and population counts, this is an uncomfortable proposition. But the authors’ central point is straightforward. Conservation is about relationships—between people and nature, and among people themselves. Ignoring those relationships does not make them disappear. It only ensures that their consequences are felt later, often by those with the least power to absorb them.

The announcement aligns with a pivotal moment on GM’s weekly chart, where the stock recently hit $85, meeting a multi-year resistance trendline known for halting price advances since 2017.

This resistance has thwarted progress before, marking failed attempts in 2018 and during 2020-2021. Currently, GM’s stock sits at $83.36 pre-market, and this charge could accelerate a decline towards the $66 level, which has served as a support point in the past.

The massive write-down follows a decrease in demand post the expiration of federal tax credits in September. This led GM to reduce production and settle costly contracts with suppliers. Notably, $4.2 billion of the charges are in cash, for settlements and cancellations. GM anticipates more charges by 2026, but expects them to be less severe.

The consistent presence of the ascending resistance trendline suggests a likely downturn when faced with such an adverse announcement. The $66 level is a logical downside target based on historical support and the current chart structure, indicating pressure on the stock.

We saw that massive $7.1 billion write-down from GM late last year hit the stock just as the charts suggested. The rejection from the $85 resistance level proved to be a powerful signal, pushing the stock down. Now, with the price consolidating around the $68 mark, we are watching to see if the key $66 support level holds.

The fundamental pressure on GM’s electric vehicle strategy seems to be continuing. Recent industry data for the fourth quarter of 2025 confirmed a slowdown, with U.S. EV market share slipping to 7.5%, down from over 9% earlier in the year. This demand problem that forced GM’s hand is not disappearing quickly.

Looking ahead, GM’s official earnings report for that fourth quarter is just a few weeks away, and we are seeing a rise in implied volatility. This means options are pricing in the potential for another sharp move in the stock. Traders should be prepared for this catalyst to either confirm the bearish trend or trigger a short-covering rally.

For those who believe more bad news is on the horizon, buying put options offers a direct way to bet on the stock breaking below that $66 support. A decisive break of that level, especially if earnings disappoint, could trigger another leg down toward lows we haven’t seen since 2024. Using put spreads can be a way to lower the cost of this trade given the rising volatility.

On the other hand, much of the negative sentiment from last year may already be priced in. If management provides a surprisingly confident outlook for 2026, we could see a powerful squeeze, making short-dated call options attractive for a speculative bounce. Selling premium through strategies like iron condors could also be considered to profit from a drop in volatility after the earnings announcement.",https://www.vtmarkets.com/wp-content/themes/vt/images/logo_meta_20201127.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 19:58:40.032900

VinFast, Vietnam’s largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, wrapped up 2025 with strong momentum: its domestic deliveries more than doubled in 2025, reaching 170,000 units – roughly one third of the country’s total car sales. With new factories opening in India and Indonesia, VinFast appears poised to take its “made in Vietnam” brand global.

However, competition in EV manufacturing has always been fierce, and 2026 opened with unsettling news for VinFast: China’s auto maker Chery, a major player in the global EV market, announced plans to open ASEAN’s largest factory in Vietnam by mid-2026, with the ambition of becoming Vietnam’s third biggest auto brand in the next 5 years.

This sets up a paradox worth unpacking. The same global trend that helped VinFast to rise and grow is not bringing its fiercest competition to its doorstep.

Riding the “China Plus One” Wave

VinFast Chairwoman Lê Thị Thu Thủy said at a forum in Hong Kong in 2024 that the company benefits from the “China Plus One” strategy, as global firms shifted production to locations outside China to reduce geopolitical risk.

The “China Plus One” (C+1) trend emerged in the early 2020s, driven by rising, less competitive labor costs in China, the U.S.-China trade war, and later COVID-19-related import and export disruptions. While China continues to play the role of the world’s factory, companies increasingly begun spreading risks by placing their bets across multiple locations.

Among the “+1” destinations, Vietnam quickly emerged as the top choice with its proximity to China, competitive labor costs, robust free-trade networks, and strong growth prospects.

This shift emerged well before VinFast’s EV manufacturing took off. Hai Phong, the northern Vietnamese industrial hub where VinFast chose to locate its factory, benefited from this trend, attracting global players such as Japanese manufacturer Bridgestone and South Korea’s LG, supported by a growing network of industrial parks with mature supply chains.

By strategically locating its factory in Hai Phong, VinFast was able to ride this “C+1” wave, leveraging existing infrastructure, supply chains, and policy support to kick-start its growth.

VinFast: A Global Hybrid Success

Since 2021, VinFast has expanded its portfolio to include electric vehicles and has since become the undisputed leader of Vietnam’s EV market and a major player in Asia’s EV manufacturing, competing with Chinese EV makers.

Its rise is, at its core, a global hybrid story. “VinFast’s strategy is focused on cooperating with global technology companies to pair their latest advancements with our products,” said CEO Thái Thị Thanh Hải.

This strategy has been implemented through partnerships with multiple players around the world, spanning sectors from semiconductors to interior design. Among all the EV components, the battery and electric motors remain the most critical, and these are largely sourced from Chinese partners, including CATL and Gotion.

Despite global partnerships, VinFast achieved 60% of its local production target in 2025 and aims to reach 80% this year.

Local production was achieved by manufacturing key components, such as car frames, in Vietnam. While the battery cells are being imported from Chinese producers, the assembly largely takes place domestically.

VinFast sources its batteries through VinES, a subsidiary of Vingroup, which obtains battery components from a number of third-party suppliers, including Gotion and Samsung SDI. VinES constructed its first lithium-ion cell facility in Ha Tinh in 2022, followed by a second plant in 2024 in partnership with Gotion, with a design capacity of 5 GWh (enough to power 100,000 EVs) per year.

As localization deepens, VinFast is moving from assembled in Vietnam to made in Vietnam.

The Paradox: The Tide Flows Back

However, the same “C+1” tide that lifted VinFast is accelerating as Chinese automakers, together with other industries, are following global firms into Vietnam and reshaping the competitive landscape again.

By October 2025, China had become Vietnam’s second-largest source of foreign direct investment after Singapore. The solar panel industry offers a clear precedent: Vietnam is now the world’s second-largest solar panel producer, primarily because Chinese large solar firms relocated their factories there to avoid U.S. tariffs.

That same “C+1” dynamic is now reaching the EV sector, with Chery’s decision to build a major manufacturing base in Vietnam.

For now, VinFast retains a strong advantage, particularly through its control of domestic charging infrastructure. But as Chinese manufacturers bring battery technology, scale, and capital directly into Vietnam, that lead may narrow quickly. In this next phase, localization is no longer a policy ambition; it is a competitive necessity.

Summary

Oklo Inc. and Meta Platforms announced a monumental agreement to develop a 1.2 GW power campus to support Meta's data center needs.

OKLO's technology for small, scalable nuclear solutions is now getting the big tech validation it needs, while also getting a lift from regulatory and demand tailwinds.

While execution risks persist, I believe the focus will now turn to tech validation and regulatory approvals to accelerate its path toward commercialization.

Financing risks could take a back seat as big tech customers appear prepared to help stem such pressures, with ""prepayment"" mechanisms featuring in Meta's agreement with Oklo.

Upgrade OKLO to Buy. I believe America's need for more power to support its leadership in the AI race over China will help bolster the renaissance of nuclear energy through the next decade.

The timing of this announcement couldn't be worse from a technical perspective.

Looking at GM's weekly chart, the stock recently spiked to $85, testing a multi-year ascending resistance trendline that's rejected price advances repeatedly since 2017. This isn't the first time we've seen GM bump its head against this overhead barrier—red arrows mark multiple failed attempts in 2018 and throughout 2020-2021. Each time, sellers showed up with force.

The recent rejection at $85 looks textbook. Price currently sits at $83.36 pre-market, but the damage from this fundamental bombshell could accelerate what the technicals were already suggesting: a move back toward the $66 level.

The EV write-down stems from weakening demand after federal tax credits expired in September, forcing GM to slash production capacity and settle expensive contracts with suppliers who had prepared for much higher volumes. Most striking is the $4.2 billion cash component—real money walking out the door in supplier settlements and contract cancellations. GM warns additional charges are coming in 2026, though management expects them to be smaller.

From a technical standpoint, that ascending resistance trendline has proven reliable for years. When overhead resistance meets fundamental headwinds of this magnitude, the path of least resistance typically points lower. The $66 target represents a logical destination based on prior support levels and the chart's structure.

NRG Energy Inc. is easy to mistake for a traditional power generator in a world of regulated utilities and opaque bills. But over the last few years, NRG Energy Inc. has quietly rebuilt itself into something closer to a consumer platform: a retail energy, home services, and grid-flexibility product engineered to sit directly between households, small businesses, and the future of an increasingly electrified economy.

In plain terms, NRG Energy Inc. is trying to solve a very specific problem: energy has been treated as a faceless commodity, even as it becomes more critical, volatile, and complex. Customers want predictable costs, cleaner options, and connected services that talk to their thermostats, EV chargers, and solar roofs. NRG Energy Inc. is betting that whoever controls that relationship – not just the power plants – will own the most valuable part of the energy stack.

This strategic shift is visible both in what NRG Energy Inc. sells and in how it positions itself. It’s no longer just about megawatts; it’s about bundled energy plans, home protection packages, smart devices, and data-driven services targeted at more than seven million customers across the United States and Canada.

Get all details on NRG Energy Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: NRG Energy Inc.

NRG Energy Inc. is best understood as a flagship retail energy and services platform operating through multiple brands such as Reliant, Green Mountain Energy, Direct Energy, and others. Instead of a single monolithic tariff, NRG Energy Inc. offers a portfolio of products that blend pricing structures, sustainability options, and value-add services.

On the retail electricity and natural gas side, NRG Energy Inc. focuses on:

• Fixed and variable rate plans: Customers in deregulated markets like Texas, the U.S. Northeast, and parts of the Midwest can choose fixed-rate contracts for price stability or variable-rate plans for more flexibility. Many of NRG Energy Inc.’s offerings are designed around term-limited contracts with transparent rates and digital account management.

• Renewable and carbon-neutral products: Through brands like Green Mountain Energy, NRG Energy Inc. sells 100% renewable electricity plans, renewable energy credit (REC) backed options, and carbon-offset natural gas products. For sustainability-focused consumers, this is the company’s most visible differentiator versus generic retail power suppliers.

• Bundled home services: One of the most notable evolutions of NRG Energy Inc. is its expansion into home services and protection plans. Leveraging the large customer base acquired through deals such as the Direct Energy acquisition, NRG Energy Inc. now sells products like HVAC maintenance, surge protection, appliance repair packages, and energy management services – all layered on top of the energy bill relationship.

• Smart home and demand response integration: NRG Energy Inc. increasingly stitches smart thermostats, load-control devices, and digital portals into its product experience. Through mobile apps and web dashboards, customers can track usage, enroll in demand-response programs, receive bill alerts, and optimize consumption. This is not yet as polished as a Silicon Valley-grade app ecosystem, but the strategic direction is unmistakable: turn the home into a controllable, flexible node in the larger grid.

• Distributed and behind-the-meter solutions: For commercial and industrial customers, NRG Energy Inc. supplements retail electricity with demand-side management, distributed generation, and storage offerings. While less visible to residential users, these products matter for grid reliability and profitability, especially as data centers, manufacturing, and logistics all wrestle with rising power intensity.

What makes this important right now is timing. Electrification is accelerating – from EVs to heat pumps – while extreme weather and aging infrastructure are stressing grids. In that context, NRG Energy Inc. isn’t just selling electrons; it’s selling predictability, resilience, and optionality, wrapped in a consumer-grade front end. Its product strategy is to become the primary energy interface at the customer level, not just one more utility among many.

Market Rivals: NRG Energy Aktie vs. The Competition

NRG Energy Inc. operates in a crowded and highly regional market, but a few names stand out as direct competitive benchmarks.

Vistra Corp. (TXU Energy and related brands)

Compared directly to TXU Energy, the flagship retail brand of Vistra Corp., NRG Energy Inc. faces a mirror rival in Texas and other deregulated markets. TXU Energy offers a similarly rich menu of fixed-rate plans, time-of-use products such as free nights/weekends, and loyalty programs.

TXU Energy has pushed heavily into creative rate structures – like plans that incentivize off-peak usage – and pairs them with basic energy insights via apps and web tools. On the generation side, Vistra is aggressively building a portfolio of battery storage and low-carbon resources that support its retail business.

Where NRG Energy Inc. aims to differentiate is breadth of brands and a stronger push into home services. While TXU Energy is a powerful, Texas-centric retail product, NRG Energy Inc. leverages a multi-brand strategy that stretches across many U.S. states and into Canada. Its bundled appliance protection and HVAC offerings give it a stickier, subscription-style relationship with the customer that goes beyond TXU’s more traditional energy-only focus.

Constellation Energy (Constellation Home & retail supply)

Constellation Energy is another core competitor, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Compared directly to Constellation’s retail supply and Constellation Home offerings, NRG Energy Inc. encounters a rival with strong ties to large commercial and industrial customers and a long track record in deregulated power markets.

Constellation’s retail product echoes many of NRG Energy Inc.’s features: fixed and variable plans, renewable options, and home services like HVAC, plumbing, and electrical work through Constellation Home in certain regions. Like NRG, it uses digital tools to let customers track usage and manage bills, and it increasingly links its products with decarbonization goals, especially for enterprise buyers.

NRG Energy Inc., though, has leaned harder into mass-market consumer branding – through names like Reliant and Green Mountain Energy – and has integrated sustainability more explicitly into its consumer-facing storytelling. Green Mountain Energy, for example, is marketed almost entirely as a lifestyle renewable product, a positioning that feels closer to a consumer brand than a classical utility.

NextEra Energy Resources & NextEra Energy Services

While NextEra Energy is best known for its renewables generation behemoth and regulated utility Florida Power & Light, its unregulated retail offerings in certain markets also bring it into competition with NRG Energy Inc. Compared directly to NextEra’s various competitive retail products, NRG Energy Inc. encounters a rival that is deeply integrated with wind and solar generation and highly focused on long-term decarbonization.

Where NRG Energy Inc. can compete effectively is on customer relationship depth. NextEra’s retail presence is still limited compared with NRG Energy Inc.’s dense network of brands and regional footprints, and NRG’s experience in pure-play retail energy and home services gives it an edge in customer experience and product variety, even as NextEra leads in large-scale clean generation.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

NRG Energy Inc. doesn’t win on a single killer feature; it wins on the combination of energy, services, and customer experience layered into a cohesive product strategy.

1. Retail-first DNA and brand portfolio

Unlike vertically integrated utilities whose primary product is regulated infrastructure, NRG Energy Inc. is set up to think about energy as a consumer product. Multiple brands – including Reliant, Direct Energy, and Green Mountain Energy – allow it to tailor offerings to distinct customer segments: cost-conscious families, sustainability enthusiasts, renters, small businesses, and large enterprises. This portfolio approach is hard to replicate for single-brand competitors.

2. Energy plus home services as a sticky bundle

Where many rivals stop at billing and basic customer care, NRG Energy Inc. goes further by turning the energy relationship into a platform for ongoing services. Bundled home protection plans, HVAC maintenance, surge protection, and appliance coverage transform a volatile, low-loyalty commodity market into something closer to a subscription services business.

That bundling matters. It raises switching costs, improves customer lifetime value, and creates new cross-sell opportunities – all while giving customers a one-stop shop for energy and core home infrastructure. TXU Energy and Constellation have pieces of this model, but NRG Energy Inc. has made it a central part of its product story.

3. Integrated sustainability without forcing a trade-off

With Green Mountain Energy and renewable-backed plans across its portfolio, NRG Energy Inc. makes it unusually simple for mainstream customers to align their energy usage with climate goals. Rather than requiring a rooftop solar install or a complex contract, consumers can choose a 100% renewable plan much as they would upgrade a streaming tier.

This is a subtle but important differentiator. As carbon accounting becomes a bigger deal for households and businesses – and as younger customers demand greener choices by default – NRG Energy Inc. is already positioned with turnkey products that don’t require a hardware overhaul.

4. Data and digital engagement at scale

NRG Energy Inc. serves millions of meters, which means it has access to a huge dataset of consumption patterns, responsiveness to price signals, and preferences across climates and regions. Its apps, web dashboards, and demand response programs are not just customer conveniences – they are feedback loops that feed into product design, hedging strategies, and grid services.

That digital layer is where NRG Energy Inc. can increasingly differentiate from legacy utilities and smaller suppliers who treat customer data as billing information rather than a product asset. Over time, this positions NRG Energy Inc. to monetize flexibility – for example, paying customers to shift usage during peak events while being compensated by grid operators – without sacrificing the simplicity of the end-user experience.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

As of the latest available market data accessed via multiple financial sources, NRG Energy Aktie (NRG Energy Inc., ISIN US6293775085) is trading at a level that reflects both the risks of the power sector and the market’s recognition of its retail-centric repositioning.

According to recent quotes from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, cross-checked for consistency, the company’s shares are changing hands in the mid-double-digit dollar range, with the most recent figures captured on the afternoon of the latest trading session in U.S. markets. Where markets were closed, the reference point is the last close price, which both sources report in a tight range with no material discrepancies.

The product strategy behind NRG Energy Inc. is central to how investors now model the stock:

• Margin profile: Retail energy and home services command better, more stable margins than pure wholesale generation, especially when combined with long-duration customer relationships. The richer the product bundle – energy, maintenance, protection, smart devices – the more predictable the revenue stream. That supports valuation multiples closer to consumer services than to commodity power producers.

• Risk management: By diversifying across regions, brands, and contract structures, NRG Energy Inc. reduces its exposure to any single weather event, regulatory change, or market shock. For equity holders, the product diversification is effectively a risk-hedging mechanism, which has been increasingly recognized in analyst commentary and price targets.

• Growth narrative: The pivot from legacy generation to customer-centric products, plus ongoing share repurchases and balance-sheet discipline, has turned NRG Energy Aktie into more of a growth-and-income story than a pure cyclical utility play. Strong performance of retail brands like Reliant and Green Mountain Energy, along with the build-out of home services, reinforces the idea that there is still headroom to grow wallet share per customer even in relatively mature markets.

Crucially, the success of NRG Energy Inc. as a product – the energy plans people actually buy, the home services they renew, the digital tools they use – feeds directly into cash flow and investor confidence. When churn is low, attachment to add-on services is high, and demand-response or grid services generate incremental revenue, the underlying business looks less like a traditional utility and more like a diversified energy services platform.

That is the real story behind NRG Energy Aktie: a stock whose long-term value will depend less on the price of a megawatt-hour and more on how effectively NRG Energy Inc. can keep convincing millions of customers that energy is no longer just a bill – it’s a configurable service they actually want.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405016_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 17:58:39.782786

This initiative comes as a response to the recent loss of federal EV tax credits, which has significantly impacted potential buyers. By filling this gap, California hopes to maintain its momentum in EV adoption and make zero-emission vehicles more accessible to its residents.

The proposed budget for the 2026-2027 fiscal year includes a “light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) incentive program.” According to the budget summary, this program is a critical part of the Administration’s strategy to keep ZEVs affordable and accessible for all Californians. The state has seen a remarkable increase in EV sales, with nearly 30 percent of auto sales in the third quarter of 2025 being electric vehicles, as reported by the California Energy Commission.

The details of how the $200 million will be distributed per vehicle remain unclear. However, reports suggest that the rebate will function as an “on the hood” instant discount for EV purchases. Previously, buyers could receive up to $7,500 in federal tax rebates for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones. The chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, Lauren Sanchez, indicated that the state is still determining whether it will also offer tax credits for used EV purchases.

Why California’s EV Tax Credit Matters Now

The proposed tax credit initiative is significant for several reasons. First, it addresses the immediate need for financial incentives to encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles, especially in light of the federal tax credits that have recently been eliminated. This change could deter potential buyers who rely on these incentives to make the switch to EVs.

Second, California has been a leader in the push for sustainability and environmental responsibility. By increasing the availability of EVs through financial incentives, the state reinforces its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting cleaner air. This aligns with the state’s long-term goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045.

The state’s actions may inspire a nationwide movement towards more robust EV incentives, fostering a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, the timing of this proposal is crucial. As the automotive industry shifts towards electric mobility, California’s initiative could serve as a model for other states looking to implement similar programs. The state’s actions may inspire a nationwide movement towards more robust EV incentives, fostering a more sustainable future.

Implications for California Residents and the Automotive Market

The introduction of this $200 million tax credit program could have significant implications for various stakeholders in California. For residents, this initiative means more affordable access to electric vehicles, which could lead to increased adoption rates. As EV prices remain high, the proposed incentives may tip the scale for many consumers who are on the fence about making the switch.

For the automotive market, this could result in an uptick in sales for manufacturers that produce electric vehicles. Companies that have already invested heavily in EV technology, such as Tesla and Ford, stand to benefit from a surge in demand as consumers take advantage of the new incentives.

Additionally, the program could stimulate job growth in the EV sector, as increased sales may lead to higher production rates and the need for more workers in manufacturing, sales, and service roles. This could be particularly beneficial for California’s economy, which has a strong focus on clean technology and innovation.

Steps to Take Advantage of California’s EV Initiative

As California residents look to benefit from the proposed EV tax credits, there are several actionable steps they can take:

Research eligible vehicles: Familiarize yourself with the list of electric vehicles that qualify for the tax credits. The California Air Resources Board provides resources that detail which models are eligible, helping you make an informed decision.

Stay updated on legislation: Keep an eye on the progress of the proposed budget and any changes that may occur in the legislative process. Understanding the timeline for the implementation of these tax credits will allow you to plan your purchase accordingly.

Explore financing options: Look into financing options that may complement the tax credits. Many dealerships offer financing plans that can further reduce the overall cost of purchasing an EV.

Engage with local EV communities: Join local electric vehicle groups or forums to connect with other EV enthusiasts. These communities can provide valuable insights, recommendations, and support as you navigate your EV purchasing journey.

However, experts caution that while the proposed tax credits are a step in the right direction, they may not be sufficient to address all barriers to EV adoption. Some analysts argue that without addressing infrastructure challenges, such as the availability of charging stations, the impact of these incentives may be limited. As noted by the California Electric Vehicle Coalition, a comprehensive approach that includes investment in charging infrastructure is essential for the success of EV adoption.

Additionally, the program could stimulate job growth in the EV sector, as increased sales may lead to higher production rates and the need for more workers in manufacturing, sales, and service roles.

California’s EV Future: What Lies Ahead

Looking forward, the proposed $200 million for EV tax credits could significantly shape California’s automotive landscape. If approved, this initiative could lead to a substantial increase in electric vehicle adoption, further solidifying California’s role as a leader in sustainability.

Moreover, as more residents transition to electric vehicles, the demand for charging infrastructure will likely increase. This could prompt further investments in charging networks, making EV ownership more convenient and accessible.

In a rapidly evolving automotive market, California’s initiative may also encourage other states to adopt similar measures, potentially leading to a nationwide shift towards electric mobility. As we look ahead, the question remains: Will California’s bold move be enough to drive a lasting change in the EV market, or will it require additional measures to truly transform the landscape?",https://careeraheadonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9799998.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 19:58:49.063586

The US Environmental Protection Agency on Friday rejected Colorado's plan to comply with regional haze regulations by shutting its coal plants, saying the state needs the plants to remain running to maintain reliable power.

The agency said Colorado's state implementation plan to reduce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution that causes haze in national parks and wilderness areas violates the Clean Air Act because the state did not get consent from one of the coal plants targeted for early retirement.

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to extend the life of aging coal-fired power plants to continue to provide baseload power to meet the growing demand for electricity from the buildout of data centres to power artificial intelligence.

""Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ensuring families have cost-effective energy,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

The administration last year issued five emergency orders to keep retiring coal plants running, most recently on December 30 when Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an order to keep a coal plant in Craig, Colorado, operating even though it was set to retire at the end of 2025.

Colorado had ordered three older coal plants that were set to retire in 2030 to shut down two years earlier to comply with its regional haze plan. The EPA said it would help Colorado rewrite its plan, or else impose one on the state.

Canadian Solar (NasdaqGS:CSIQ) has completed and priced a US$200 million offering of 3.25% senior unsecured convertible notes due 2031. The proceeds are earmarked for U.S. manufacturing, battery energy storage projects, solar initiatives, and general corporate use.

The new US$200 million convertible notes come after a sharp 23.73% 7 day share price decline and a 14.44% 30 day share price return, even as the 90 day share price return is 36.58% and the 1 year total shareholder return is 58.72%. This points to longer term momentum contrasting with recent weakness as investors reassess both growth potential and risk ahead of Canadian Solar’s expanded U.S. manufacturing and battery storage plans.

If you are comparing Canadian Solar with other clean energy names, this could be a useful moment to see which peers in tech heavy renewables stand out through .

With Canadian Solar trading at US$19.38 and showing mixed returns across different timeframes, along with an intrinsic discount of roughly 5%, the real question is whether markets are overlooking future upside or already pricing in growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 16.9% Undervalued

With Canadian Solar last closing at US$19.38 against an implied fair value of about US$23.33, the most followed narrative sees meaningful upside baked into its long range storage and solar build out.

The company's forward integration into battery storage, with plans to expand BESS manufacturing capacity from 10 GWh to 24 GWh by 2026 and battery cell capacity from 3 GWh to 9 GWh, positions Canadian Solar to capture higher-margin business and increase average order value, positively impacting future net margins and earnings.

Curious what sits behind that higher margin story and higher fair value? It rests on specific revenue ramps, margin shifts, and a future earnings multiple that might surprise you. The full narrative lays out each assumption and how they stack together for that US$23.33 figure.

Result: Fair Value of $23.33 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this higher fair value story still hinges on policy and trade questions, with U.S. tax credit changes and tariff actions both potential spoilers.

Another Way To Look At Value

That 16.9% upside story sits next to a very different message from earnings based valuation. Canadian Solar trades on a P/E of 80.5x, compared with 61.1x across peers and 42x for the wider US Semiconductor group. Our fair ratio estimate is 140.5x.

This wide gap suggests the market is already paying a rich price relative to peers, yet the valuation is still below where the fair ratio indicates it could move. For you, the real question is whether that spread signals upside that is simply out of favor today, or valuation risk if sentiment cools.

They can earn revenue through renting land to renewable energy developers, while generating power for nearby communities.
A fast transition could save trillions Farmers with land to rent out aren’t the only ones expected to reap financial benefits from a clean energy system.
A nuclear-led transition would cost around $25 trillion more by 2050 than today’s energy system.
“Basically, you invest to put up the clean energy system and that will save you the money that you’re currently spending on buying fossil fuels,” Bond said.","In the rolling hills of southeast Queensland, Australia, farmer and businessman Brent Finlay stands beneath turbines so tall they rival skyscrapers.

“There’s a lift inside that takes about 12 minutes to go from the bottom to the top,” he said, pointing skyward. Forty-five of the giant turbines that now dot his property are part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm which will soon generate enough electricity to power 700,000 homes.

It’s a world away from the climate disaster Finlay endured five years ago when a devastating year-long drought turned his fertile land to powder, birds fell dead from the trees and thousands of native kangaroos perished from extreme temperature fluctuations.

“Our ecosystem didn’t just decline, it collapsed,” he recalled.

Despite experiencing firsthand the devastation climate change causes, Finlay’s choice to host the wind turbines is not an environmental statement. “It’s additional revenue… an investment for future generations on this farm,” he told DW, pointing out that intensifying weather extremes are making farming more precarious.

Since then, he’s been using regenerative farming practices to restore the wool and beef farm that’s been in his family for more than 100 years. But he’s also one of a growing number of farmers now allowing renewable energy projects on their land. They can earn revenue through renting land to renewable energy developers, while generating power for nearby communities.

A fast transition could save trillions

Farmers with land to rent out aren’t the only ones expected to reap financial benefits from a clean energy system.

As the price of renewables technology continues to plummet, experts predict savings across the board — from lower household power prices to fewer costly climate disasters.

In fact, the quicker a transition happens, the cheaper it will be. Even without taking into account the savings to be made from avoiding costly climate disasters, aUniversity of Oxford study

found a shift to renewables by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion (€10.2 trillion) in energy system costs. As compared to sticking with fossil fuels.

And those savings would be made while producing more energy overall and expanding electricity access worldwide.

The reason a rapid transition would provide more savings is because the more renewable energy technology is being made, the cheaper it’s getting.

Economists describe this phenomenon as a “learning curve” called Wright’s Law, which shows the costs of certain technologies fall as cumulative production increases. The same pattern drove down the price of aircraft, cars, computers, and DNA sequencing over the past century.

Prices for solar, wind, battery storage continue to fall

In the last ten years, the cost of solar panels has dropped by around 90%, largely thanks to an explosion in Chinese manufacturing capacity.

“Solar power is the cheapest form of energy in history,” economist Gernot Wagner from Columbia Business School told DW. “This stuff is so cheap that Germans are installing it as garden fencing. It keeps the dog in and the car charged.”

Wind power has also dropped in price by about 70% since 2014. And battery storage — vital for storing wind and solar power — is also fast improving, with prices declining by 85% compared to the 2010s.

“When you have small modular technologies, it’s much easier to reduce costs because essentially you have innovation taking place over tens of thousands or even millions of different agents,” Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist at the UK-based energy thinktank Ember, told DW.

Technologies vs. commodities

Compare that to the fossil fuel system, which relies on finite materials that need to be located, extracted from the ground, transported across the world, and can only be burned once.

Coal, oil and gas prices fluctuate based on geopolitics, supply shocks, and market speculation, but they do not get cheaper over time. And this price fluctuation has serious economic consequences, climate economist Wagner explained.

“That’s where Putin blows a fuse, invades Ukraine… and we have the summer of 2022 when electricity prices in Europe were 10 times as high as they should have been,” he said.

Solar and wind technology require upfront manufacturing and construction costs, but low operating costs. Once a solar or wind farm is built, the “fuel” — sun and wind — is free and immune to global market shocks.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA),

in 2024, generating electricity from solar was almost half as expensive as the lowest-cost fossil alternative, and wind power was even less. As renewable capacity expands, that price difference is expected to continue growing.

Nuclear power stands out as an exception, however. Unlike solar and wind, it’s not getting cheaper. A nuclear-led transition would cost around $25 trillion more by 2050 than today’s energy system.

Why fossil fuels cost more than they seem

Sticking with fossil fuels might feel cheaper because the infrastructure is already built. But — even without taking into account the enormous cost of its harmful impact on the climate — running this system comes with massive ongoing operating costs.

The constant mining, transport, and machinery used to extract and refine the fuels are hugely expensive. Another hidden cost comes in the form of what economists call “rent” — the extra profit that fossil fuel-producing countries can charge for coal, oil and gas simply because they control scarce resources that are in high demand.

Saudi Arabia, for example, can extract oil for roughly $5-10 a barrel,then sell it for between $50-100. According to World Bank data, these global fossil fuel “rents” amount to as much as $2.5 trillion a year.

“We’re pouring thousands of billions of dollars into the pockets of the petrostates and making them very wealthy,” said energy strategist Bond. “It’s that money that’s up for grabs that we don’t have to spend anymore.”

Spending differently, not more

Contrary to popular belief, transitioning to clean energy sources like solar and wind does not require spending more overall, Bond explained. Most of the investment required can simply be reallocated from what would otherwise be spent on maintaining and expanding fossil fuel infrastructure.

“Basically, you invest to put up the clean energy system and that will save you the money that you’re currently spending on buying fossil fuels,” Bond said.

Money that would otherwise go toward building new pipelines, upgrading old refineries or paying for fuel imports can instead be invested in wind and solar farms, storage and grid upgrades — assets that deliver energy at far lower long-term operating costs.",,N,,2026-01-11 17:58:24.391731

Is NuScale Power's stock a buy now that it is closer to the lower end than the higher end of its 52-week range?

10 stocks we like better than NuScale Power ›

NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) has a very exciting technology around which it is attempting to build a business. The problem is that it still hasn't made its first official sale. Is it worth buying the stock while it's trading below $24, or is the risk just too high right now?

What does NuScale Power do?

NuScale Power has designed a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR). SMR technology could be an important step forward for the nuclear power industry. Traditional large-scale, site-built nuclear power plants are massive capital investment projects that require a lot of time to construct. The most recent U.S. nuclear power plants to be built, Vogtle 3 and 4, were years late and wildly over budget.

An SMR is built in a factory, which is intended to make the building process safer and quicker. The smaller size of an SMR should make it less costly to build. A unit's size should also allow an SMR to be placed closer to population centers and easily transported where needed. The modular design would also allow SMRs to be linked to create larger power plants, which might interest electric utility customers.

SMRs would still be significant capital investments, but the benefits are alluring. For example, a data center supporting artificial intelligence, which uses a huge amount of electricity, could have its own dedicated SMR. That would save the data center from having to be connected to the power grid, a process that can take a long time and cause criticism because of the huge power demand of AI.

NuScale Power's big idea has yet to land a home

NuScale Power has exciting technology to offer the world. What it doesn't have yet is a customer. This is a significant problem, as it needs to demonstrate that its SMRs work. The first official sale is likely to be a big turning point for the business, since it will likely make other customers more comfortable with NuScale's SMR technology.

NuScale Power has two potential customers lined up. A Romanian power company is currently considering up to six NuScale SMRs. NuScale is generating some revenue by offering consulting services to RoPower and engineering and construction company Fluor (NYSE: FLR) in the assessment effort. A final decision isn't expected until late in 2026 or in early 2027, roughly a year beyond earlier expectations.

Meanwhile, the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy are looking to use NuScale technology in U.S.-based power projects. So far, details are sparse.

Adding to the complexity is the fact that Fluor was an early investor in NuScale Power. It has been selling shares and plans to exit its position entirely in 2026. The first share sale occurred while NuScale's stock was near its 52-week high. However, the stock has fallen dramatically since, and Fluor's plan to sell more shares could be a lingering drag on the stock price until it is completed.

Buy only if you have a high tolerance for risk

When you consider the risks and potential rewards, NuScale Power is likely a stock that most investors should avoid. That's true even as it trades lower than $24 a share and far below its 52-week highs. Even aggressive growth investors might want to consider waiting until the company has a concrete agreement to sell its first SMR before making a purchase. Until that point, NuScale Power's stock price will largely be driven by emotions and news.

The Democrat said Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind projects had already cleared more than a decade of security and safety reviews by federal, state and local authorities.
The Interior Department’s order last month suspended Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and three other offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast.
Trump has also dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, expensive and a threat to wildlife as he pushes fossil fuels over renewable energy for electricity production.

State Attorney General Letitia James said in legal challenges filed in federal court in Washington that the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Dec. 22 order suspending construction on the projects off Long Island, citing national security concerns, was arbitrary and unwarranted.

The Democrat said Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind projects had already cleared more than a decade of security and safety reviews by federal, state and local authorities. She said pausing them now threatens New York’s economy and energy grid, and she asked the court to intervene.

“New Yorkers deserve clean, reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a government that follows the law,” James said in a statement. “This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk.”

Spokespersons for the Interior Department and its Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which are both named in the litigation, declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation.

The Interior Department’s order last month suspended Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and three other offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast. The department maintains that the movement of massive turbine blades can cause radar interference called “clutter” that can obscure legitimate moving targets and generate false ones.

Trump has also dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, expensive and a threat to wildlife as he pushes fossil fuels over renewable energy for electricity production.

Empire Wind is located about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) southeast of Long Island and is projected to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor, the Norwegian company developing the project, has said it’s about 60% complete.

Sunrise Wind is located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Montauk and is expected to power about 600,000 homes. Orsted, the Danish energy company developing the project, has said it’s roughly 45% complete.

Both developers have also filed their own legal challenges, as have the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.

“And there’s also the amount of time it would take to develop nuclear, it’s longer than even the term of offshore wind and we’re looking a decade out for offshore wind,” she continued.","As federal support for offshore wind energy is upended, industry advocates are noting future potential and the scale of state and private sector investment. Offshore wind planning, contracting and investment were summarized during Jan. 7 online presentations to the Community Economic Resilience Consortium, which is led by Gregg Foster of the Redwood Region Economic Development Commission.

An audience of city and county officials, business owners, legislative representatives and members of non-profit groups were told of the US. offshore wind sector’s progress. Humboldt County has a stake in the industry and vice versa, as wind energy projects are slated for areas 20 miles offshore of Eureka.

Nancy Kirshner-Rodriguez of Oceantic Network, a non-profit group “dedicated to building, defending, and advancing the US. offshore renewable energy industry,” said $25.5 billion has been invested in various segments of the US offshore wind supply chain.

The total investment is relevant to Humboldt “just to see the amount that has been invested already in the US supply chain and the potential opportunities that we hope will emerge,” she continued.

The Trump administration’s distaste for offshore wind energy is reflected in presidential executive orders and cancellations of grants, including a $427 million grant for redeveloping the county’s Humboldt Bay port.

But Kirshner-Rodriguez described legal pushback against federal actions, including multiple lawsuits filed by wind energy companies and East Coast states. And she said her firm has been “doing a lot more work the last six months educating members of Congress about where supply chain has come from.”

There have been substantial investments in research and development, manufacturing, large vessels and ports, with 57 percent of supply chain and manufacturing investments in Republican districts, according to Oceantic.

Much of the spending is related to projects happening “far away,” said Kirshner-Rodriguez, but US involvement has invigorated various industries. “The interesting thing is there have actually been vessels built in the US, some of the largest,” she continued.

But the offshore wind industry is now “challenged” and several East Coast power purchase contracts have been terminated.

RWE, one of the companies leasing off Humboldt’s coast, has laid off employees in its US division but Kirshner-Rodriguez said the company “is maintaining their US portfolio” and despite being “a lot more bare bones now,” it’s “pushing forward in many different ways.”

Noting the reel back of federal port development funding, Kirshner-Rodriguez acknowledged that “obviously it’s a very challenging situation right now.”

But there’s plenty of support for offshore wind energy on the state level. California’s Proposition 4 bond measure includes $475 for port development and Humboldt has gotten a preliminary award of $18.5 million for planning its port project.

The state’s power grid operation agency has approved $4.6 billion for the transmission infrastructure upgrades needed to distribute offshore wind energy.

Astrid DuBois of Brightline Defense, a non-profit whose work includes “ensuring that local communities and regions benefit from in the transition to renewable energy” talked about some takeaways from a November 2025 wind energy gathering in Humboldt. “The reality is that the federal landscape does have impacts and implications and so we’re figuring out how to navigate that,” DuBois said.

On the port, she said there’s commitment to develop it “in as green of a way as possible” and “the general message that came through was there’s still a lot of progress and momentum, even in light of the loss of that major federal grant.”

But developers “really are in a waiting game,” she continued, and “they’re not putting their necks out in California and doing major investments at this time.”

During a question and answer session, Wilfred Franklin of the North Coast Small Business Development Center said he’s concerned that “the actual threat is nuclear power being revived and if that’s somehow subsidized, that really could be the death knell for any other capitalists being interested in offshore wind.”

Kirshner-Rodriguez acknowledged that California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant “isn’t going away anytime soon” but the same can be said of nuclear power’s Achilles’ heel – radioactive waste. “And there’s also the amount of time it would take to develop nuclear, it’s longer than even the term of offshore wind and we’re looking a decade out for offshore wind,” she continued.",https://kymkemp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Windmill_4_4964085447.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 17:58:29.517021

The Chevy Bolt 2.0 is on its way to dealer showrooms as we speak. In fact, some dealers may already have them in stock. The headline news about the new Bolt is that it comes with a 65 kWh LFP battery pack supplied by CATL and has an EPA estimated range of 262 miles — 7 more than GM said it would have when it was officially revealed last fall.

Where the extra miles came from is a bit of a mystery, and readers should be aware that the range of the new car has not yet been rated officially by what’s left of the EPA. Apparently, there is great marketing potential in that range estimate, as it exceeds some models of the Nissan LEAF by a few miles.

The other good news is that the base price of the new Bolt LT is $28,995, including delivery — making it the lowest priced new electric car you can buy today in America. The Bolt RS starts at $32,995.

Chevy Bolt 2.0 Specs

Underneath the skin, the powertrain for the new version of the Chevy Bolt is virtually identical to the one in the Chevy Equinox EV. That means a front-mounted 210 horsepower motor — 10 more ponies than the original car. It is being manufactured at the GM Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City.

The original car was limited to 50 kW of charging power, which made recharging on trips arduous. The new car triples that number to 150 kW, which means drivers can charge from 10 to 80 percent in 26 minutes — a big improvement. Almost everyone loved their original Bolts, but nobody loved their slow charging performance.

The switch to an LFP battery pack also means owners can charge to 100 percent on a regular basis if they wish. Conventional wisdom holds that cars with NMC battery packs should not normally be charged beyond 80 percent in order to prolong battery life, but LFP batteries don’t have that limitation. In addition, the new Bolt comes standard with a NACS charging port, which means drivers can charge their cars at Tesla Supercharger locations.

One last bit of information about charging: The new Bolt, when paired with a GM vehicle-to-home charging product, can discharge up to 9.6 kW to help power a home if there is an interruption in the utility grid. That’s a feature many people may find attractive.

The new Bolt looks a lot like the old Bolt, which is no surprise, since it is basically an update of the former Bolt EUV. The interior has been substantially updated. The original car in 2017 had a dashboard that was a bit of a mishmash, as GM was still figuring out how to build cars with screens.

The new version features upgraded materials and comes standard with an 11-inch digital instrument cluster, an 11.3-inch touchscreen with Google built in, plus adaptive cruise control and automatic climate control. The new car does not offer either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which may distress some people, but that decision seems to be part of a new GM policy for many of its latest models.

According to GM Authority, customers will have several options to upgrade the technology features of their Bolt. They can add GM’s Super Cruise Package (RPO code WK7) that adds hands-free driving capability on selected highways for $3,255.

The Technology Package (RPO code CWM) is available for $1,695 on LT and $1,195 on RS models and adds enhanced driver-assist features such as HD Surround Vision, a wireless phone charger, and a rear pedestrian alert system and upgraded connectivity. An illuminated charging port is also an option (RPO code 62G) for $450.

That is the kind of nickel and dime stuff that manufacturers love to use to add a few bucks to the bottom line. Putting a light inside the charging port might cost $1.97 at the factory level, but if you have ever tried to plug your car in on a moonless night, you will wish you had it. You can pay Chevrolet $450 or you can keep a $2 flashlight handy. Your choice.

We also think the rear pedestrian alert should be standard on all new cars. Once you have experienced it, you quickly learn how often things are going on behind you while backing up that you may not be aware of.

Also on the option list is a Dual Panel Sunroof Package, which adds a power tilt and sliding front sunroof glass and a power sunshade for $1665. Charging solutions include the GM PowerShift Charging Package (RPO code PED) for $2,371 and the GM PowerUp 2 NACS charger (RPO code 5CH) for $899.

All six paint colors are available at no extra charge, including Relic Green Metallic, which will be available at a later date. RS customers will also be able to select the extra-cost Atomic Yellow paint package that includes red stitching on the interior upholstery.

How Long Will The Bolt Be Offered?

General Motors is a bit of a schizophrenic when it comes to policy. It lobbied hard for the OBBB last year that ended the existing EV tax credits early. Had that not happened, the new Bolt would have had a net cost to customers of around $22,000 — a very attractive number. So, while it was developing the second-generation Bolt, GM was also working behind the scenes to make it less affordable — which hardly seems to be a recipe for getting more people to buy one.

GM is also banging the drum for rolling back exhaust emissions standards so it can sell more gargantuan trucks and SUVs, even though the effluent flowing out of their tailpipes is a direct threat to human health thanks to all the fine particulates released into the atmosphere as a result. And don’t ever get us started on how those emissions promote higher global temperatures.

My wife and I drive a first-generation Chevy Bolt with a new battery pack, and there are some things about it that I like better than our Tesla. For one, I really appreciate the little yellow warning indicators that pop up in the sideview mirrors when there is a car in my blind spot. That system is accurate and intuitive, whereas taking my eyes off the road to look at the touchscreen in the Tesla is not.

Second, I like the size of the Bolt, which has virtually the same passenger space as the Tesla but in a smaller footprint. I have always been a fan of small, nimble cars like the MGs and the Miatas I drove for more than 30 years. To me, the Bolt is right-sized while the Tesla is about half a size too big for my tastes.

Whether the new Bolt will be a sales success remains to be seen. When it comes to the EV revolution, the US seems to be in a form of nuclear winter, thanks to government policies more in tune with the days of the Ford LTD than the best electric cars available today.

It would surprise no one if Chevrolet cancelled the Bolt again because sales do not reach expectations, just as it has done so often in the past. If the Bolt 2.0 is the car for you (no car ticks all the boxes for every driver), you may not want to tarry too long before placing your order.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-2026-Chevy-Bolt.png,N,,2026-01-11 16:58:25.126146

Therefore, decarbonization will require a collaborative approach from suppliers, transporters, distributors and employees, making supply chain partners central to emission reduction efforts through coordinated collaboration.
The development of advanced insulation materials and PCMs significantly enhances cold chain efficiency.
The pharma cold chain is vital but achieving meaningful progress toward net zero demands action well beyond Scope 1 and 2 cuts.
True climate progress depends on collaboration across the entire cold chain to match its critical life-saving role with strong environmental performance.","The pharmaceutical cold chain (PCC) refers to the storage and transport of temperature-sensitive drugs, vaccines and biological products within strict temperature limits to preserve their safety and effectiveness. Because even small deviations can compromise a product, the PCC must remain unbroken from manufacture to delivery. This creates a complex, tightly coordinated process in which every participant must prevent any lapse in temperature control, which ranged as low as -2°C to -150ºC and below, for certain medications and vaccines. The World Economic Forum reported that over 50% of vaccines were annually wasted due to temperature failure in logistics, resulting in a loss of annually $35 billion.

Major key feature of PCCs:

· Temperature-controlled storage like refrigerated warehouses.

· Usage of temperature-controlled vehicles with power back-up to avoid spoilage.

· Real tracking and monitoring are conducted using technologies such as RFID, GPS, and IoT sensors, for transparency and quick response to temperature deviations.

· Adherence with U.S. and international regulatory guidelines, including FDA, WHO, Good Distribution practices (GDP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for proper handling and storage conditions of the pharma goods.

Temperature fluctuations, high infrastructure costs, inventory management and regulatory complexities were persistent challenges, but the environmental impact of PCC was more concerning. A Green Paper by Health Care Without Harm and ARUP revealed that the global healthcare industry generates 4.4% of global carbon emissions and the PCC emits 55% more than the automotive sector. The United States, China and the EU together accounted for 75% of these emissions. With the stricter regulations from the Paris agreement, pharmaceuticals were needed to develop a more efficient, sustainable and green cold chain.

Holistic strategy to decarbonize the PCC:

· Setting decarbonization goals: Clear, timeline-based reduction targets shape the net-zero pathway, ensuring long-term progress through science-based objectives.

· Understanding emissions: Understanding the emission categories is key to effective planning. Scope 1 emissions cover direct emissions from company operations, mainly through its facilities and vehicle fleets. Scope 2 emissions from purchased energy and Scope 3 from broader value chain comprising both “upstream” and “downstream”. Companies should pursue all emission scopes, beginning with the more controllable Scope 1 through focused training, monitoring and oversight.

· Collaborative approach: IQVIA estimates that Scope 3 emissions account for over 70% of a pharma company’s carbon footprint and remain the hardest to manage. Therefore, decarbonization will require a collaborative approach from suppliers, transporters, distributors and employees, making supply chain partners central to emission reduction efforts through coordinated collaboration.

Scope 3 emissions, arising from a company’s extended supply chain, are particularly challenging due to global supplier complexity and inconsistent reporting standards. Despite this, 72% of pharmaceutical companies have set Scope 3 targets, typically pursuing either absolute reductions or incremental supplier engagement.

The ways to achieve Scope 3 emissions in PCC:

· Shift to renewable energy and green transportation. The cold chain’s carbon burden remains high, with an estimated 4 million refrigerated vehicles in operation worldwide and diesel supplying roughly 84% of the sector’s fuel. A single trailer refrigeration unit can emit roughly 8 tons of CO₂ annually, while cold warehouses consume uninterrupted power to maintain temperature stability. Therefore, the companies should participate in initiatives such as RE100 that encourage commitment towards generating 100% electricity through renewable sources. Measures like solar-powered warehouses, wind solutions and emerging hydrogen technologies can be adopted for lowering emissions. A gradual shift was observed in transport practices, moving from air to lower-emission sea freight, adoption of electric fleets and more efficient routing. Greener fuels such as hydrotreated vegetable oil can cut emissions by up to 90%, and evidence suggests gas-fueled vehicles can save more than 1,400 tons of CO₂ over two years compared with diesel.

· Creating manufacturing and operational efficiency: Pharmaceutical manufacturers need to upgrade to modern, energy-efficient refrigeration and storage systems, which now offer far better insulation and performance than earlier models. Regular reviews of available technologies allow firms to ensure their operations remain as efficient as possible. Advanced energy-management systems further reduce waste by optimizing consumption. At the product level, innovations in formulation are also easing temperature requirements. Newer insulin varieties, for example, remain stable at room temperature for several weeks, reducing the need for constant deep cooling and lowering overall energy use. The localized manufacturing should be considered at the place where they will be used, which can reduce GHG emissions associated with the pharmaceutical distribution.

· Circular packaging: Cold transport’s environmental impact can be reduced substantially by replacing single-use passive packaging with reusable, battery-powered active systems. Operating within a circular model, these units cut lifetime emissions by more than 90%, even when return trips are included. This would reduce the volume and weight of the packaging, lowering production energy and also freeing transport space, which results in reduced vehicle requirements and distribution-stage emissions. The development of advanced insulation materials and PCMs significantly enhances cold chain efficiency. They can absorb, store, and release large amounts of energy, maintaining a consistent temperature range. Recyclable or biodegradable materials further add another layer of benefit without compromising thermal stability or product integrity. Renting pre-conditioned, multi-use containers prepared in renewable-powered facilities further supports carbon-neutral goals.

· Customer engagement. Just the reverse of supplier engagement, this focuses on collaborating with customers to reduce product lifecycle emissions and their Scope 3 impact. One pharma company partnered with hospitals to promote proper device use, disposal, and recycling, cutting downstream Scope 3 emissions by 12% in a year and diverting 75 tons of medical waste from landfill.

AI integration was inevitable to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Research indicates AI-driven optimization can lower energy costs by 15-20%. Here’s how AI advances a green supply chain:

· IoT-enabled monitoring provides real-time temperature tracking, reducing errors and manual checks.

· Equipment failures are anticipated for timely maintenance, minimizing downtime and costs.

· Temperature anomalies and malfunctions trigger automated alerts for rapid intervention.

· Data is analyzed to support compliance, reporting, and strategic decision-making.

· Route planning is optimized to maintain temperature compliance and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

· Repetitive manual processes can be automated, leading to a revolutionary rise in supply chain and operational efficiencies as well as a cost reduction.

The pharma cold chain is vital but achieving meaningful progress toward net zero demands action well beyond Scope 1 and 2 cuts. Companies must understand their full Scope 3 footprint and target the most effective levers across the value chain. True climate progress depends on collaboration across the entire cold chain to match its critical life-saving role with strong environmental performance.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/stock-shot.bO01FQwsrI.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-11 21:13:13.312812

President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.
Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.
But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,"" Wright said.
I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela,"" Wright said.","Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Sunday that it's ""quite likely"" American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela's oil industry as the country moves on following the removal of former President Nicolás Maduro.

""That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,"" Wright said Sunday on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

But Wright said the U.S. has not taken over running Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil and gas company. President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.

""No, today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers. And then that crude goes out into the market,"" Wright said. ""We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.""

U.S. forces captured and removed Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3 and brought them to New York to face federal charges alleging narco-terrorism and cocaine importation, among other charges. Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.

""With United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think….we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela,"" said Wright. ""This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.""

Wright said that means working with officials in the current government Maduro left behind, even though many of them have been indicted in the U.S. Those officials include Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, a strongman who has also previously been indicted in the U.S.

""We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,"" Wright said.

Still, Wright said, ""we don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today.""

""We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela,"" Wright said.

President Trump on Sunday in a social media post warned another U.S. adversary in the region, Cuba, that it is cut off from Venezuelan oil, writing the island nation should ""make a deal before it's too late."" But Wright told Brennan off camera Sunday that the U.S. is not currently asking Mexico — a key fuel supplier to Cuba — to cut off oil to the isolated Caribbean island nation.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/11/d5985982-0fbb-448a-bbc2-7418c1b8e3ca/thumbnail/1200x630/64c6f0aed9894030d5d5f3fdb02bd710/1768150152231.png,N,,2026-01-11 14:58:10.939207

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly attended the signing ceremony alongside senior government officials.

The first project, titled “Energy Valley,” will be developed by Scatec in Minya Governorate. The 1.7-gigawatt (GW) solar power plant will be integrated with 4 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) distributed across Minya, Qena, and Alexandria.

The second agreement involves Sungrow establishing a battery storage manufacturing factory within the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) Egypt zone in the El-Sokhna industrial area, part of the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

Spanning 50,000 square meters (sqm), the facility will be the first in the Middle East and Africa to produce BESS. It is expected to have an annual production capacity of 10 GWh at full operation, with production scheduled to commence in April 2027.

The case addresses whether Chevron and other energy companies can move a Louisiana state lawsuit to federal court under the federal-officer removal statute, based on actions taken on behalf of the federal government during World War II. Roughly 40 lawsuits have been filed since 2013 over oil and gas companies’ alleged role in Louisiana’s coastal erosion, and the Supreme Court’s upcoming review of Chevron U.S.A. v. Plaquemines Parish decides whether those cases can be moved from state to federal court.

“At the end of the day, this is about federal supremacy… that means that those doing the work of the federal government can’t be hauled into some state or local court to face judgment for the work they’re doing for the federal government,” Mike Fragoso a partner at Torridon Law PLLC, said in a statement. (RELATED: Trump DOJ Joins Fight As Major Players Sound Alarm Over ‘Climate Lawfare’ That Could ‘Cripple’ American Energy)

Several parties filed amicus briefs in September — including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Republican Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox — arguing the lawsuits should be heard in federal court because some of the alleged conduct occurred during World War II when companies operated under federal contracts.

Chevron and other energy companies are urging the Supreme Court to overturn a Fifth Circuit ruling that found the oil companies failed to establish federal jurisdiction. Former U.S. Attorneys General Bill Barr and Michael Mukasey, along with numerous state attorneys general, support Chevron’s position. They argue the parishes are seeking to impose retroactive liability for conduct that the federal government previously authorized.

“The FDR administration ordered the oil companies to drill as much oil as they can in Louisiana and then refine it into aviation gasoline. … In an emergency situation like wartime, you can’t just go around suing people 80 years later for what the government told them to do,” John Shu, a constitutional law expert and legal commentator who served in the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If you can sue somebody 80 years later for what the government told you to do to win a war, then no one’s going to do it.”

Others like Alliance For Consumers Executive Director O.H. Skinner argue the lawsuits could harm consumers as he links them to “woke lawfare,” or in other words, lawsuits pushed by climate activists that seek to wield the courts to enact their agenda.

Skinner told the DCNF previously that “woke lawfare is one of the key fronts being pressed by left-wing activists, where they hope to obtain the policy victories in court that have been rejected at the ballot box and in the halls of Congress. … This Louisiana lawsuit is a chief example of the climate lawfare that is being pushed by these activists and trial lawyers. It would mark a major turning point for the Supreme Court to rule against the plaintiffs and provide its first decision disrupting that campaign.”

Many major climate lawsuits brought by Democrat cities and states against energy companies have been dismissed recently, though some analysts argue that if even one surviving case succeeds, it could set a precedent with far-reaching impacts for the energy sector and consumers.

The Louisiana oil and gas industry is massive, generating over $54 billion for the state in 2021, according to an analysis from the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). The Gulf Coast accounts for 55% of American refining capacity, with Louisiana’s Gulf Coast alone accounting for a significant portion, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Legal experts, including Carrie Campbell Severin, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, have pointed out alleged close ties and aligned interests between Louisiana’s governor and a trial lawyer leading many of these cases.

Fragoso also argued that “Louisiana is probably the worst place in the country for getting hometowned. Their judges are elected… with the support of plaintiffs’ lawyers… Plaquemines Parish [has] like 23,000 people in it. So do the math of $745 million divided by 23,000 people, and you’re seeing the financial incentive for any individual resident who’s on the jury is tremendous.”

Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry moved to intervene in the local government lawsuits against the oil and gas companies and said they had “differing and competing interests” that affected Louisiana’s coastal restoration and economy in 2016, according to NOLA.com, a local New Orleans publication. Landry has since voiced support for the lawsuits.

The Baton Rouge law firm Talbot, Carmouche and Marcello, represented the local government’s lawsuit against Chevron for wetlands damages. It also donated $300,000 to the Protect Louisiana’s Children PAC, which supported Landry’s gubernatorial run in 2023, according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

I read the Opinion by Rob Kaplan and Nicole Speer, “Boulder stayed safe during windstorm because of city planning, we must all play a part in continuing that work,” and I had to laugh. I live on 8th Street. Our power went off twice, for 24 hours and 28 hours each. At 14th and Baseline, there was power working … six blocks away! Evidently, XCEL thinks that at 8th Street we are in imminent danger, but at 14th Street everything is fine. My point? There is zero logic in who was powerless and who wasn’t.

I would ask Rob and Nicole why, after four years, we have not required XCEL to bury lines. They just actually put in taller poles (wooden) that are higher, and, although away from tree lines, they are more exposed to the wind. How extensive was Nicole and Rob’s preparation for this decision by XCEL, and why wouldn’t they require them to bury cables? What exactly were they doing? Frankly, I never saw one city vehicle on my street during either of the shutdowns. I did see XCEL trucks in the alley one time.

The answer is generators. They happen to run mostly on gas. What new ideas do you have in this area? We were very lucky that the weather was warm. Had it been cold, we and everybody else up here would have had busted pipes and millions of dollars’ worth of damage. I’m curious as to what the City is doing to help get in front of the next event for homeowners that live in the city? The City has really done nothing, much like Xcel. I am very disappointed in my City Council, and your tooting your horn is disgusting, quite frankly.

Congress needs an epiphany

January 6, 2026, was the holy day of Epiphany, celebrated in Christian churches all over the world as the coming of light as represented by the Magi.

January 6, 2021, was the date of the insurrection in the nation’s Capitol, led by Donald J. Trump.

It is time for Congress to have an epiphanic moment and reclaim its constitutional powers and responsibilities to our democratic government, to the people of this great nation, and to the world.

Should US use steel pennies?

We have seen numerous statements from Washington about how the government loses money making copper pennies. Would it be better to use steel pennies, as was done in 1943?

In November, we welcomed ISA Advocate members and delegates to nine regional policy discussions. From each meeting, we came away with great input on ISA’s policy resolutions. A massive thank you to the folks who participated in person and those who called and sent emails to voice their concerns and suggest updates to our resolutions. We truly appreciate your support through ISA Advocate membership — your investment supports our lobbying efforts at the statehouse and in our nation’s capital on your behalf.

Notable issues we anticipate in this year’s legislative session: property taxes, property rights, food ingredient bans and providing consistency in labeling for crop protection tools. Note: As this article is written weeks ahead of session, all things are subject to change; policy conversations can quickly shift.

The property tax discussion has varied as the legislature considers a path of tax relief or a more complex path of tax reform. That discussion will likely include removing the tax exemption on forest and fruit tree reservations: we will support that effort again in 2026.

As the legislature considers food ingredient bans and possible definitions of ultra-processed foods, ISA will continue to collaborate with legislators, associations and industry partners to reinforce the health attributes and safety of soy foods. Local communities thrive as farmers grow feed and food, including soy-based products. To drive healthy outcomes, it’s a holistic approach: active lifestyle, maintaining close relationships with friends and family, and focusing on a nutrient-dense, balanced diet.

We also anticipate proactive legislation that would provide consistency and clarity on pesticide labeling. These products undergo rigorous scientific review and are issued registrations from the U.S. EPA. Approved labels should be consistent from state to state related to health and safety information, meeting state-level notice requirements.

Another key topic we’ll see addressed in 2026 is property rights. Eminent domain has been a residual issue as stakeholders discuss the future of carbon capture pipelines and landowner property rights. The Senate may put forward legislation addressing issues from the previous year to start the session. I commend anyone who attempts to get the hard work out of the way first.

As we continue to work on policy impacting Iowa’s farmers, it’s worth noting that your investment in an ISA Advocate membership directly supports our efforts keeping ISA’s priorities top of mind with key decision makers.

A consortium of U.S. senators – including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.
), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them.
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, “data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth” for utilities.
Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans’ already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies.","For months, anger has been building in the communities that are involuntarily footing the bill for the AI boom. As data center clusters pop up around the globe to feed AI’s massive and growing computational needs, nearby communities are seeing their utility bills skyrocket, even if they themselves don’t benefit from the sector at all. And now, in the United States, the backlash against data centers’ resource consumption – and its impact on consumers’ bottom line – has spilled out of the bounds of local politics and landed in the Senate.

A consortium of U.S. senators – including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them. In open letters written to seven AI companies, the senators pushed for accountability and transparency, citing a study that found “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, “data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth” for utilities.

Due to this intense demand growth, major utilities in these states, plus North Carolina, project that they will collectively add 32,600 MW of electrical load over the next 15 years. And it’s consumers – of energy, not necessarily of AI – who will have to pay the price for all of that additional demand. It’s estimated that Virginians can expect average electricity prices to increase by another 25 percent by 2030.

""We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations—data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,"" Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider earlier this year. ""Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.”

And the terms behind that transfer of responsibility are extremely opaque, as is typical for the AI sector. In the Senators’ letter to AI companies, they blast these firms for operating in the shadows against public interest. The letter notes that AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans’ already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies. Data centers require huge amounts of land and considerable water sources, which could lead to conflict and issues of scarcity in certain hotspots such as drier climates and agricultural communities concerned about land competition and “environmental impacts, noise and lack of transparency.”

In many ways, the country – and the world – simply is not prepared for the scale of the AI boom, and all of the resources and regulations that it will require. There are serious concerns about whether ageing power grids can keep up with demand, and whether energy output can keep up with surging demand. Plus, the way that our systems are designed simply never saw this coming.

As the senators express in their letter, “the current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying” in which costs are shared by all grid users, “was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

It’s proof that when we trust in American ingenuity and unlock our own resources, we build a more prosperous future for everyone.","The number on the gas station sign says it all: $2.97 per gallon. For the first time in four years, that price will be a reality for the average American in 2026, according to GasBuddy’s report released Tuesday. This is the expected result of a clear shift in how our leaders approach energy: a return to American energy abundance.

Energy policy must be judged by one standard: does it help people live better, more prosperous lives? For too long, our leaders failed us on that front. Policies of restriction from previous administrations drove up costs, weakened our electric grid, and punished working families. President Donald Trump and the 119th Congress have reversed that course, starting on Day One with executive actions and landmark legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) to unleash our nation’s vast energy resources.

We were told that mandating solar and wind power would lead to cheaper electricity. But America’s experience over the last four years shows how wrong that was. And a recent study by the nonpartisan Institute for Energy Research found that states with the most aggressive mandates for so-called “renewable energy” sources suffer from the highest electricity rates.

In places like California and New York, families pay as much as double the national average for power and rates rise up to three times faster than the rest of the country. The reason is simple: when politicians force an electric grid to depend on sources that only work when the sun shines or the wind blows, operators must build and maintain a second, redundant system of reliable power plants. Consumers pay for both, and their electricity prices soar.

Blue-state politicians are welcome to ride these policies into the ground, but President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s energy dominance agenda is building a “best of the above” approach that allows the most affordable, reliable power to win business.

This commitment to affordability extends beyond the electric meter. The administration has ended and is actively unwinding costly, job-killing federal mandates that were designed to force Americans into expensive electric vehicles they didn’t want and couldn’t afford, especially under the previous administration’s historic inflation rates.

These top-down rules would have dramatically increased the price of all cars and trucks while putting our automotive industry at a global disadvantage. By scrapping them through executive orders and in the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump has protected consumer choice by ensuring that families can buy the vehicles that best suit their needs and budgets.

Looking ahead, our nation’s energy needs are set to grow enormously. The energy demands of artificial intelligence, the reshoring of supply chains and manufacturing, and further electrification of consumer goods require a grid that is stronger and more reliable than ever before.

This is why the administration’s focus on unleashing U.S. resources such as oil, natural gas, and critical minerals is so important. It lowers prices at the pump, reduces the cost of manufacturing goods, and makes American businesses more competitive. It’s also why the administration’s focus on fostering a nuclear renaissance is so critical. Nuclear energy is the backbone of a reliable grid, providing immense amounts of dependable power around the clock. By supporting our existing nuclear fleet and paving the way for new, advanced reactors, we are ensuring that America has the power it needs to lead the world for the next century.

Gas prices are down, and it’s not because President Trump flipped a switch in the White House. It’s an expected, and now delivered, result of a purposeful agenda that puts abundance over forced scarcity and that values reliability over virtue signaling. It’s proof that when we trust in American ingenuity and unlock our own resources, we build a more prosperous future for everyone.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this.
As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere?
It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this.
It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing.","Sandweg, who led the nation’s top immigration enforcement agency from 2013 to 2014, said ICE serves the entire public — and its politicization is doing it no good. He’s also critical of the administration’s hasty response to Good’s killing, which he argues only further undermined public trust in ICE activity.

As Sandweg sees it, ICE needs to pare back its visibility: stop taking partisan sides, mend relationships with local partners and cease publicly announcing their operations. He stresses the need to de-escalate — but worries it isn’t coming anytime soon.

“It’s going to be a long time,” Sandweg says, “before the agency recovers.”

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Videos of the Minneapolis shooting are circulating online, and there have been lots of different reactions. The Trump administration is claiming that ICE agents were operating in self-defense. State and local officials have swiftly denounced that conclusion. Did you watch the videos, and what was your reaction?

I’ve seen a couple of the videos. To me, it highlighted why it’s so important that you withhold judgment until there is a thorough investigation, and why that’s the standard practice any time there’s an officer shooting.

I feel like each video provided a different perspective that could lend itself to a different conclusion. Of course, I think the entire thing is tragic. And if I were at ICE, what I would hope is that the investigation is not only a tool to determine, if in that moment the officer’s decision was reasonable, but also to look at this holistically. To try to inform us, how can we make sure something like this doesn’t happen again?

Anytime anyone is killed, it’s a horrific tragedy, and I think we need to do everything we can to learn from it. And I do worry that with the quick rushes to judgment and, in many ways, the politicization of this issue, it makes it harder for us to try to at least draw some good from this — which would be trying to reduce the chances of this reoccurring.

Pretty quickly after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem framed it as an act of self-defense, insisting that the agent was responding to an act of “domestic terrorism.” Other members of the Trump administration seemed to agree. But what information might the DHS actually have had, in the aftermath of the shooting?

I just can’t imagine any secretary, or the department itself, ever saying anything at that moment other than, “We’re committed to having an investigation here.” Whether that was a Republican administration or a Democratic administration.

I’ve been through five years at DHS, which included a significant portion of time as a senior advisor to a secretary. Whenever something major happens, the initial information we received almost always had severe inaccuracies. You learn very quickly in that job not to trust the initial information. Anytime there’s a major event, information is flowing and fast.

You cannot rush out and make pronouncements about what’s going on until the dust settles a bit and you have a more accurate picture of what happened. There have been a couple of incidents with [FBI Director] Kash Patel, who’s rushed out to get facts out to the public, and then later those facts proved, pretty quickly, to be wrong.

With a shooting like this, you need to look at the totality of the circumstances. Not only does each video give you a different angle and a different perspective, but there’s so much information the videos don’t capture … You have to wait for all the facts to come in.

But the other reason why that’s significant, though, is because there is going to be an investigation. The public expects an investigation. The risk you run, especially in this environment we’re in now, is that people don’t believe in the government. They’re losing faith in ICE as an institution.

What’s the point of the investigation? We’ve already announced this was a justified shooting, right? “No mistakes were made. We followed our training perfectly.” “She was a domestic terrorist trying to kill people” — I don’t know how you could possibly draw that conclusion at that stage. What was she doing that day? What were her intentions? Are there signs that she was actually trying to kill an officer, that she was in that state of mind that day? 37-year-old mothers don’t typically try to kill federal officers.

But you can’t get [evidence] unless you’re executing search warrants on her phone, getting into her email communications, interviewing people who knew her. In any event, the irresponsibility is not only rushing up to the public and giving them information that isn’t vetted, but it also undermines the investigation … I just can’t imagine anyone’s going to have confidence in that investigation anymore.

And how exactly do you investigate an incident like this?

Every case is different. Some of the protocols require, of course, getting the officer off the scene, interviewing the officer as quickly as possible about their perspective. All of this gets really complicated. The FBI has taken charge of this investigation, typically you would have some DHS entity involved in that investigation

They interview witnesses and look at all the available evidence; they get all of the available surveillance cameras, interview all the officers at the scene, try to build back what was going on that day.

The investigation itself would determine whether, under the use of force rules, the officer had a reasonable belief that he was facing imminent danger. But it would also look at everything else that happened and if mistakes were made that require administrative action.

One thing we learned recently about the officer involved in the Minneapolis shooting is that he had recently been the victim of a dragging incident with a car. What psychological supports are available for officers after an attack?

There’s certainly tools available. You don’t return to duty until you’re fit for duty. I know there’s an evaluation there. Obviously, everybody’s going to bring their own personal experiences to the job. That’s just the reality of the situation. And, by the way, the investigation will look into that, if there were fitness reports or other things.

But I certainly don’t believe just because somebody was the victim of an assault, that they can’t do their job. We probably wouldn’t have very many officers if that were the standard.

The Trump administration has floated the idea of immunity for the agent. Obviously depending on the outcome of the investigation, what could that look like? Could the officer be prosecuted?

This raises a lot of complicated issues. The state of Minnesota might make their own decision about what happened and whether any state crimes occurred. The state of Minnesota could independently charge the officer. The federal government could obviously charge the officer as well. If the state charges the officer, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity. Vice President JD Vance misspoke at the press conference when he said, “absolute immunity.” There is no absolute immunity. There’s qualified immunity.

Certainly, the state could charge the officer with murder. The officer could have to make a court appearance or two, but there is a process in place, when it is a federal official exercising their official duties, where they can seek removal of the case to federal court. If it’s deemed that they were acting in their official capacity, they were doing their federal job, then the federal court can assert jurisdiction in order to make a determination as to whether they’re entitled to qualified immunity.

As we talked about in our previous interview, it’s difficult to question use of force because we don’t know what the agents knew, what they were thinking at the moment, or what sort of threat they perceived. But with escalating violence across the country, does it seem like the DHS needs to revisit that “objectively reasonable” policy?

I don’t think the policy or the standard needs to be changed. I mean, this is a uniform use of force standard that all law enforcement agencies basically employ.

What I do think we need to do, though, is look at this holistically… Are we doing things that have made our agents more vulnerable, and are we doing things that have made the public more vulnerable? The administration should be thinking, “OK, what have we done?”

From my perspective, a couple of things have been done. We’ve shifted tactics. We have officers engaged in a lot more traffic stops now than we previously did. We have officers now confronting these protesters, something that ICE very, very rarely did before. We pulled Border Patrol agents up off the border, where they operated in a completely different environment, and put them in an urban environment … We’ve put our officers in a very difficult position.

On Thursday, Border Patrol agents shot two people in Portland. We know less about the Portland shooting than we do about Minneapolis right now. But these two incidents were nearly back-to-back. Are you concerned that these violent incidents are starting to form a pattern?

The statistics suggest that these shootings are up significantly. But I want to be really clear. Nobody at Border Patrol, nobody at ICE, wakes up and says, “I want to shoot someone today.” It’s the last thing they want to do.

But so, we have to ask ourselves, “Why is this happening?” It goes back to exactly what I said.

The administration has said, in order to make mass arrests, we’re going to pull agents out of what they’re trained to do, and out of their normal operating environment, and we’re going to put them in an urban area with a completely different type of policing. That is where I think the frustration should be.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this. They say this is what you have to expect when you pull these agents out of their normal environments, having them do things that they’re not trained to do.

As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere? And will it be harder for protesters to exercise their rights?

Immigration enforcement has always been politically charged, but now it’s even more charged. And we’re turning it into a both-sides-ism. There is a middle ground here. This is what’s frustrating to me and to other people who worked at ICE. You can be pro-immigration enforcement. You can have, like during the Obama administration, extensive immigration enforcement focused on the right people, done without being so politicized.

But in any event, will it be harder? Of course, yes. It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this. By becoming so political, just at a bare minimum, what it does is it makes it incredibly hard for ICE to [maintain] these relationships with state and local partners, which are so critical to a law enforcement agency like ICE. Those are incredibly damaged right now. Our relationships with these large cities are damaged.

It’s going to be a long time before the agency recovers.

I asked you this question three months ago. Maybe your answer is the same, maybe it’s changed. Where do we go from here?

I’d like to see us deescalate things. ICE serves the entire public. It doesn’t serve a political party. It doesn’t serve just red America, and it’s not the enemy of blue America.

It doesn’t mean you have to back off immigration enforcement … But try to do things in a less overt manner. Don’t try to antagonize. Don’t take sides. Lower the visibility of ICE. You can keep doing these operations but go back to some of the tactics we’ve seen before where that are lower profile, less visible. Do your job. Do your job quietly.

Stop announcing these operations. This is so bizarre to me. How high-profile [it is], we announce weeks in advance that ICE is coming to town. Candidly, that just puts the officers in greater jeopardy. You’re telling all the potential targets, “We’re coming to get you next week.” I mean, what?

I think we need to de-escalate. But unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’re doing that.

ICE operations in Minnesota are especially large. When we last spoke, one of your biggest concerns was whether ICE could ratchet up its activity without cutting corners on training and recruitment. That doesn’t seem to be the case here; the officer who fired shots in Minnesota had experience with the agency. But just broadly speaking, could inexperience, these concerns about declining training standards, lead to more incidents like these?

Absolutely. I mean, you have a supercharged environment where things are incredibly tense. The officers are operating in a reality where the assaults on them are up. We’re having them do things that seasoned officers have been trained to do. It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing. And now you’re sort of flooding the agency with these new hires.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-11 12:13:16.049414

MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will. Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced–

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that–

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.

MARGARET BRENNAN

Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.

Toyota Motor Corp. detailed plans to invest $912 million to increase output of hybrid components and vehicles across five states, part of a broader $10 billion commitment in the US over the next five years.

Factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri will see 252 new jobs as a result of the initiative, the world’s biggest carmaker said in a statement.

The move underscores Toyota’s bet that hybrids will dominate US sales in the near term as consumers balk at high EV prices following the end of tax credits. The investment may also strengthen the Japanese carmaker’s foothold in the market as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and other US carmakers scale back EV ambitions and revisit hybrid strategies to meet shifting demand and emissions targets.

Toyota now offers hybrid-only versions of the RAV4 compact crossover and Camry sedan in the US, thanks to robust demand for gasoline-electric powertrains with better mileage.

The Japanese manufacturer, which has long advocated for a more measured approach to sell a broad range of vehicle options for different markets, said that its “philosophy is to build where we sell,” and that its North American manufacturing sites assemble some 76% of the vehicles sold in the US.

In November, Toyota confirmed it would boost spending in the US, after President Donald Trump said in October that the carmaker planned a large-scale investment. Trump has been pushing to shift more production to the US and has imposed punitive tariffs on many car parts and vehicles sourced from abroad.

Even in China, the world’s top EV market, analysts are anticipating a slight slowdown in sales growth, due in part to narrowing government support for the industry.
The EU recently softened its ban on combustion vehicle sales, though, and EV sales are slowing.
“Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth,” BNEF analyst Huiling Zhou said in a recent report.
The sweet spot of the U.S. auto market is the midsize SUV that costs $35,000 or less.","Growth in global sales of electric vehicles is expected to slow this year as China winds down some subsidies, Europe wavers on its phase-out of combustion engines, and U.S. producers and policymakers make a U-turn from the segment.

BloombergNEF expects drivers to buy 24.3 million passenger EVs this year, an increase of only 12% on 2025 and weaker than the 23% growth in sales last year.

In the U.S. in particular, electric vehicle makers are facing an “EV winter,” and will need to navigate bumpy months ahead before a likely revival in sales in 2027 and 2028, said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for EVs and energy storage. Though the long-term trajectory for battery-powered vehicles remains positive, there isn’t “a 2026 story buried in there that says there’s lots to be optimistic about,” he said.

Ford Motor Co.’s decision in December to take $19.5 billion in charges related to a sweeping overhaul of its EV business — including the move to convert its flagship electric F-150 Lightning truck to an extended-range hybrid vehicle — highlighted the fragility of the sector’s short-term prospects, and capped a series of strategy rollbacks from major producers outside China.

The Trump administration’s withdrawal of up to $7,500 consumer tax credits in the U.S. after September and hollowing out of fuel-economy standards has sent the nation’s EV market tumbling. U.S. sales in November plunged 41% from a year earlier, and the nation’s annual passenger EV sales are forecast to contract 15% in 2026, according to BNEF.

Even in China, the world’s top EV market, analysts are anticipating a slight slowdown in sales growth, due in part to narrowing government support for the industry. Beijing has cut the EV tax break in half for 2026, while a cash-for-clunkers program will include new restrictions limiting eligibility. Authorities have criticized “rat-race competition” in the nation’s crowded auto sector, and are cracking down on discounts offered to counteract waning demand.

“The Chinese government is definitely trying to cool the price war,” said Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights, a California-based auto industry consulting firm.

Fierce competition saw BYD Co., China’s EV champion, post its weakest annual sales growth since 2020 last year, as rivals including Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and technology giant Xiaomi Corp. begin to gain ground. The nation’s auto firms are also seeing growth slow as they try to expand in tougher markets, such as smaller cities and rural areas.

China’s passenger EV sales, including plug-in hybrids and extended-range hybrids, are expected to have reached 15.6 million in 2025, a 27% increase on the previous year, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence forecast. Sales for 2026 are projected to rise just 13%.

The country’s auto producers have aggressively tapped export markets as demand at home softens. In the first three quarters of 2025, Chinese companies sold nearly a million EVs overseas, a 54% increase from 2024.

Automakers have plans to continue to expand overseas sales in 2026. BYD alone is aiming to export 1.6 million vehicles, according to Citi analysts, while brands like Geely’s Zeekr, Chery Automobile Co. and SAIC Motor Corp. are all targeting offshore markets.

Despite European Union tariffs, the bloc remains the top destination for Chinese vehicles, according to BNEF. The EU recently softened its ban on combustion vehicle sales, though, and EV sales are slowing.

While EV policy is deteriorating, the sector’s economics are improving. Affordability has been among the largest barriers to EV adoption in the U.S., and battery prices — the most expensive part of any electric car or truck — fell another 8% in 2025, according to BNEF estimates. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth,” BNEF analyst Huiling Zhou said in a recent report.

In the U.S., producers are expected to debut several models in 2026 with sticker prices far below the average price drivers pay for an internal combustion engine car. The sweet spot of the U.S. auto market is the midsize SUV that costs $35,000 or less. American drivers buy somewhere around 2.5 million midsize SUVs every year, and 40% of them fall under that price threshold.

There will be at least five all-new or substantially overhauled models that will launch in or around that price point in 2026, including the Toyota C-HR BEV, Subaru’s Uncharted, the Kia EV3 and an all-new model from the startup Slate Auto.

Again.

The House on Thursday passed a “clean” three year-extension, meaning the extra subsidies that expired on December 31 would restart and remain in place through the end of 2028 with no adjustments to the formula. The aid would be retroactive to January 1, providing some belated relief for the more than 20 million Americans whose insurance got more expensive once the extra subsidies lapsed.

Democrats have been seeking something along these lines since last year, and it was their top demand during the government shutdown last October and November. They finally got a bill to the House floor by convincing four Republicans to join them in signing a discharge petition, which forced a vote despite the objections of GOP leadership. Those four GOP votes were enough to create a majority, one that got significantly larger on Thursday when seventeen House Republicans voted yes on the proposal itself.

The final count was 230 to 196, which qualifies as a big win in today’s polarized, mostly party-line congressional environment. In any other week, it would have dominated the news, although the outcome isn’t as surprising as it might seem. Nearly all of the House Republicans who voted for the extension on Thursday are seeking re-election in closely contested districts where, you can safely assume, they are hearing from angry constituents.

But it also wouldn’t have happened without the persistence of key advocacy organizations and Democratic politicians like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the veteran congressman from New York. Jeffries was as responsible as anybody for making health care a focus of the shutdown—a decision that drew plenty of skepticism—and then for keeping his caucus united around demands for a clean extension.

From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets.
ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains.
Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners.
Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.","American Resources Corporation through its minority holding in Fishers-based ReElement Technologies Corporation,a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining for the commercial and defense industries, announced the closing of a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners, LLC (TEP).

This investment will accelerate the commercial deployment of ReElement's proprietary, multi-mineral refining platform, with an initial focus on the buildout of the Company's Marion, Indiana facility to meet near-term domestic demand. From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets. Leveraging its versatile and modularly scalable refining architecture and proprietary chromatographic separation processes, the Marion site will focus on processing light rare earths, heavy rare earths and other critical defense elements. With TEP's support, the Marion facility will scale to an initial capacity greater than 10,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of refined critical minerals production sourced from recycled feedstocks, and mined mixed rare earth concentrates, with an ability to further scale in Marion and several other strategic locations.

ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains. This includes the Company's recently announced partnership with the U.S. Department of War and Vulcan Elements to support a fully vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. ReElement is also partnering with POSCO International Corporation, a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions, to further reinforce U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

Beyond magnet supply chains, ReElement's proprietary chromatographic refining platform is uniquely capable of meeting demand for heavy rare earth elements and other critical defense materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States. These include yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, dysprosium, and other essential minerals that underpin U.S. energy, advanced technology, and defense applications - and that remain subject to severe supply constraints and export controls from China.

Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise - an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP's global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement's international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement's global growth.""

""TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure"" said Pat Eilers, Managing Partner and Founder of TEP, ""ReElement's uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement's collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.""

Leveraging this strategic commitment, ReElement is positioned to play a critical role in securing U.S. and allied supply chains by delivering high-purity critical minerals at costs competitive with global markets. The Company's refining platform represents a new model for domestic and allied-nation processing - one that can be deployed rapidly, occupies a fraction of the footprint of traditional refineries, and produces ultra-high-purity outputs with significantly reduced environmental impact.

ReElement's modular approach enables rapid deployment across the United States and allied jurisdictions, co-location with mining or concentration assets, lower capital and operating costs, and cleaner, solvent-free processing compatible with U.S. environmental standards. Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20260110-115801-eb8-GettyImages-1400437847.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 11:02:07.829979

Christian Smith,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/11/aurora-considers-c-pace-loan-program/,"Aurora is considering creating a lending program, to be run by a state agency, that would offer loans towards sustainability upgrades to commercial properties.
Loans given through the program could fund certain upgrades to commercial, industrial, non-residential agricultural, nonprofit and multifamily properties, according to Lindburg’s presentation.
However, the lenders bill and collect the payment separately from the property’s tax bill, according to Brad Fletcher of the Illinois Finance Authority.
The C-PACE program was recommended for approval by the Aurora City Council’s Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee on Tuesday.
It is now set to go before the Committee of the Whole before heading to the Aurora City Council for final approval.","Aurora is considering creating a lending program, to be run by a state agency, that would offer loans towards sustainability upgrades to commercial properties.

The proposal, as heard by a committee of the Aurora City Council on Tuesday, would allow the city to participate in the Illinois Finance Authority’s Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE. This type of lending has been available statewide since 2017, but individual local governments still need to approve its use within their boundaries.

“This really supports both economic development and sustainability at the city of Aurora,” Alison Lindburg, the city’s director of sustainability, said of the proposed C-PACE program at the Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee meeting on Tuesday.

Loans given through the program could fund certain upgrades to commercial, industrial, non-residential agricultural, nonprofit and multifamily properties, according to Lindburg’s presentation. In total, the loans could be for up to 100% of the project’s total cost, with a maximum amount no more than 25% of the property’s total value.

Upgrades that could be funded through the program include energy efficiency improvements like lighting, HVAC or insulation upgrades; the installation of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal; the addition of water conservation systems; upgrades to improve resiliency like flood mitigation or infrastructure improvements; and the installation of electric vehicle charging stations.

City staff were recently talking to a property owner that needed to replace a large number of a building’s windows, and this financing tool could be a good option to help them do that, Lindburg said. That’s because replacing windows can help with energy conservation, making the project eligible for this type of financing.

The funding can also be used as a “gap” financing tool to support larger projects, she said, if they include energy efficiency or related improvements. Along with renovation projects, new construction is also eligible to receive this lending.

The loans will generally have a fixed, low interest rate and have terms as long as 40 years, although most will have terms of 10 to 30 years, according to her presentation. And unlike traditional loans, it is backed by the property, not through a personal guarantee by the owner, so it can be transferred to new owners if the property is sold.

In particular, C-PACE loans are repaid through a special “assessment lien” on the property, which is sort of like an additional tax on the property. However, the lenders bill and collect the payment separately from the property’s tax bill, according to Brad Fletcher of the Illinois Finance Authority.

After a property owner applies for C-PACE lending, the Illinois Finance Authority is the one that actually issues bonds or notes through private lenders, according to Lindburg. The Authority works with a variety of these private lenders, she said, which makes the process competitive so property owners can get a very low interest rate.

The city of Aurora wouldn’t be providing funding through the program and generally wouldn’t have much involvement in it, Lindburg said. However, the Illinois Finance Authority will be providing regular updates to the city, and the city would still get final approval over the loans, according to Fletcher.

Lindburg said the proposal would bring “another tool to our tool belt” for improving buildings within Aurora. Plus, it would also help to increase property values, lower the operating costs of buildings, encourage the reuse of older buildings, create jobs for local contractors and trades, support sustainability goals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help with long-term economic development, her presentation showed.

The C-PACE program was recommended for approval by the Aurora City Council’s Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee on Tuesday. It is now set to go before the Committee of the Whole before heading to the Aurora City Council for final approval.

According to the Illinois Finance Authority’s webpage on C-PACE, which can be found at www.il-fa.com/programs/c-pace, there are six counties and 16 cities already participating in its program.

Aurora staff in December presented early plans to bring funding programs like this one to the city. In addition to a C-PACE loan program, staff were also said to be working on a similar program for residential properties along with different financing options for small businesses and neighborhood improvements.

In it, Marko Lehtimäki said that his company's obsession is to ""make electric vehicles so good that combustion becomes irrelevant.""

Now that Norwegians have had a taste of dodging (inconvenient) fuel expenses, they should prefer extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with decent electric range, which they can charge at home.","Two pieces of recent news made me realize something I had never thought about. The first was the presentation of Donut Lab's solid-state batteries (SSBs). The second was an article I wrote about the absurd idea that, if Norway buys almost 100% of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), any other country can do the same. Both news led me to the same conclusion: for current BEVs to become mainstream, they need cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) to disappear.

The Donut Lab SSB info that made me realize this was not written by any of my colleagues. It was a more direct experience, related to watching the video that the company released on January 5. In it, Marko Lehtimäki said that his company's obsession is to ""make electric vehicles so good that combustion becomes irrelevant."" If you watch all 24 minutes of the presentation, you'll see that Lehtimäki is not a marketing guy spilling out empty jargon. The man truly believes that.

The Donut Lab co-founder and CEO even mocked the green playbook by saying that making these vehicles ""greener"" was not the point, as most BEV advocates believe that to be enough. Lehtimäki bravely addressed all shortcomings current BEVs face: ""range, charge time, cost, weight, and lifetime."" Before that, he acknowledged that ""the entire EV experience is still limited by one component: the battery"" (pack).

The Donut Lab CEO said the company's SSB ""reshapes the economics and the experience of electric mobility forever."" As they have a 400 Wh/kg energy density, cars powered by them will be lighter than current competitors with the same range or offer more range with the same weight. A different chemistry would enable these cells to be cheaper. Donut Lab said they can fully charge in 5 minutes – without having to limit it to 80%. The 100,000-cycle capacity is almost too good to be true.

I have contacted Donut Lab to understand how credible these claims are. So far, no luck. I suspect the company will just wait until Verge Motorcycles starts delivering its new TS Pro product to prove its claims. Competitors will surely test it and tear it down to discover all about what may become the first vehicle with SSBs. That's Donut Lab's chance to prove it helped make a vehicle that is ""not just as good, but better in every way"" than those powered by an ICE.

Whatever the outcome is, the deal is that combustion is still relevant, which leads us to the article I wrote about Norway. When the Norwegian government decided that the country should go electric, it was probably counting on the end of ICE vehicle production at some point. Europe tried to impose that by 2035. As a land without any mass-production car factories, Norway buys whatever other countries are willing to sell.

Several people believe the BEV transition to be complete in the Norwegian market. They want to make it an example for the world, which is ridiculous. As I mentioned in my article, such results were obtained artificially in a very rich country. They will only stand while the Norwegian government has the funds to sustain the artificial conditions that established them.

Should they disappear, and ICE cars are to compete with BEVs on a level playing field, they will win back that market. Any place that has had the time to understand that current BEVs are disposable as soon as their battery packs fail will go back to combustion. First, due to financial costs. Second, due to convenience.

Although engines also do not last forever, they may sit for years with no use and can be quickly put back to work with simple steps. Battery packs' best shot is to last around 15 years, but only if they are regularly used. If they sit idle anywhere for months, a year tops, they turn into massive paperweights. That is part of what makes depreciation hit BEVs so hard. Most of it relates to how costly these components are, which makes it prohibitively expensive to replace them if that is necessary.

The high battery pack prices also make BEVs much more expensive to purchase. That alone could explain why these vehicles do not sell as much as ICE cars. If it costs more to buy them and you end up selling them for a lot less money than you would get for a comparable ICE vehicle, is it any surprise what most car customers will prefer?

As for convenience, that's what regular fuel stations offer. While they are still around, people will prefer to fill up a tank rather than spend precious time ""fast"" charging anything. Now that Norwegians have had a taste of dodging (inconvenient) fuel expenses, they should prefer extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with decent electric range, which they can charge at home. That's perfect for saving money on daily errands without the handicaps of BEVs.

If you think it through, what Marko Lehtimäki stressed in his video was that BEVs with current lithium-ion cells are unsustainable. That's what keeps combustion relevant. When European Union (EU) politicians finally understood that, they revoked the ICE ban they had established when they thought it was all a matter of goodwill. They could not risk killing European automakers and enraging millions of European voters.

By keeping ICEs available, BEVs will still have to compete with them, and, so far, nothing in the electric field has proven to be a match. Even the best options require compromises and concessions. In other words, they are a choice based on taste and beliefs, not on rational arguments.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/for-the-bev-takeover-plan-to-work-it-needed-ice-car-production-to-stop-263890_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 07:59:02.267990

I appreciate its P280 Portable Power Station’s 2,048-watt-hour capacity and 2,000-watt inverter.
On our side, it’s “drill, baby, drill.” China, meanwhile, has nearly 650 gigawatts of installed solar capacity and adds more solar energy each year than the rest of the world combined.","LAS VEGAS—Elon Musk once said that if you wake up believing the future will be better, it’s a bright day. Walking into CES in Las Vegas for the first time ever this week, I expected that brightness. What I found instead was uneven lighting, particularly in the area that concerned me the most: consumer-grade energy storage and solar generation.

My interest is personal. More frequent and intense storms in North Carolina, where I live, have been disrupting our power in the summers and winters. I’m also working from the road a lot and need power for my electronics. So I’ve researched ways of generating and storing my own power, all while watching the tech’s acceleration—especially in the East.

It was hard to ignore the pull of what was emerging from Shenzhen.

At CES, the Chinese big-brand booths felt like the kind of morning Musk was talking about: loud, confident, unapologetic. The tech they were showing off was light-years ahead of anything shipping from US borders. I couldn’t find any US companies, such as Goal Zero (recently acquired by BioLite), at CES, an absence that told its own story.

Ever since my days as a young engineer, I’ve been told to root for the US. To buy American. Unfortunately, the industry is floundering or barely there, especially in the consumer market segment for people like me who want portable power options or for those looking to go completely off-grid.

At CES, the confident visions and sense of momentum were all coming from the East. It was hard to ignore the pull of what was emerging from Shenzhen.

While the US Retreats, China Goes All-In

President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill dramatically accelerates the elimination of tax credits for renewable energy. The 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners was terminated on Dec. 31, disincentivizing American production and investment. Trump also signed an executive order to eliminate federal subsidies for “unreliable” green energy sources, including solar.

The Chinese government, on the other hand, has gone all-in on solar, battery, wind, and hydroelectric technologies. Solar panels, both residential and portable, have decreased in price by approximately 90% over the past decade, largely due to China’s large-scale manufacturing capabilities. The conversion efficiency (the percentage of harvested sunlight converted into actual electricity) averages around 25%, up from 19% last decade.

Simultaneously, LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery production has gone from a modest market share in 2010 to around 94% of global capacity. Chinese manufacturers, such as BYD and CATL, have risen to international dominance as a result.

How Portable Power Improves My Life

Two years ago, I sold my home-built battery inverter system, which I carried in my truck to harvest solar power, store it in a 12-volt DC battery bank, and convert it back to usable 120V AC power. I replaced it with a modern, integrated EcoFlow Delta 2 Max, an all-in-one portable power pack that boasts an integrated 2,400-watt AC inverter and a 2,048-watt-hour battery storage capacity. It features multiple charging options, with up to 1,000 watts of DC solar input and up to 1,800 watts of AC charging from a wall socket.

I’ve loaded the Delta 2 Max into my Land Cruiser behind the rear fold-down seat. I run a solar power line from a Lesun solar panel custom-cut for the vehicle’s hood. It produces about 65 watts during the day, which keeps the Delta 2 Max charged when I’m not using the truck regularly.

I run an AC line from the Land Cruiser’s integrated inverter to charge the battery as I’m driving. It provides juice to my Starlink Mini and my HP Dragonfly laptop. In addition, it powers the 12-volt Dometic 35-liter refrigerator, which my wife uses to transport food when we travel to the Outer Banks, where prices in the local grocery can be nearly double what they are on the mainland.

The View From the CES Floor: Dazzling Innovations

Given the importance of the Delta 2 Max in my life, my first stop at CES was the booth for EcoFlow, a China-based company. What I found simply amazed me. On display was everything from a 10,000-milliamp-hour magnetic phone charger to a modular, whole-home battery-powered inverter system with AC and solar inputs. The latter is one of the first consumer energy systems that collapses the gap between portable power, home backup, and grid-scale thinking into something a homeowner can actually buy, install, and live with.

Next, I met with the team at Jackery—a US firm owned by the Chinese tech company Shenzhen Hello Tech Energy—and found an equally expansive line of lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries and solar-generating options. I was impressed by the company’s pioneering XBC curved shingles, which are virtually indistinguishable from traditional terra cotta roof tiles. Solar tiles like these are the sort of product Musk championed many moons ago, but there has been little to no follow-through in the US.

Bluetti, a Shenzen-based company, also impressed me. I was particularly interested in its Pioneer Na Sodium‑Ion Portable Power Station—the first of its kind. The light-blue-colored battery has a 900-watt-hour capacity. Compared with lithium ions, sodium ions are larger and move more gently, causing less structural stress inside the battery’s crystal matrix. Sodium batteries consequently perform well in cold and hot environments and have many more charging cycles than lithium packs. Their only downside is the energy density—in the same-sized container, you get about half the power storage of lithium.

Bluetti representatives confirmed what the other Eastern suppliers were saying: Their fastest-growing market segment was the modular whole-home backup system. Many consumers had started with a 2-kilowatt-hour system (like my EcoFlow Delta 2 Max) and scaled up to 10-, 20-, or 40-kilowatt-hour systems, using modules that can be plugged easily into a home's existing infrastructure. As climate change worsens weather conditions, consumers want to ensure that if and when the grid goes down, they’ll still have power.

Bluetti, Jackery, and EcoFlow reps also said that customers are using whole-house versions of their systems to harness cheaper electricity during lower-cost rate times of day to help combat the rising price of power in the US.

The 'Drill, Baby, Drill' Mentality

I had one last visit on my list at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Tucked away in the Southern Hall was a newcomer to the scene: Aferiy, also out of Shenzen. The company is a self-described tier 2 manufacturer, with an emphasis on affordability. I appreciate its P280 Portable Power Station’s 2,048-watt-hour capacity and 2,000-watt inverter. It has similar specs to my Delta 2 Max, but was $400 cheaper.

Reps told me the company’s market share is growing in Europe, and it was just now beginning to get a foothold here in the States. I was impressed with their modern minimalist design and clear, easy-to-read LCDs. This was a well-thought-out product that shone bright.

I came away from CES with the impression of two countries with very different priorities. On our side, it’s “drill, baby, drill.” China, meanwhile, has nearly 650 gigawatts of installed solar capacity and adds more solar energy each year than the rest of the world combined.

I don’t think China is eating our lunch, per se. I think they made their own lunch. The nation invested in the kitchen, hired better chefs, refined its recipe year after year, and turned its offerings into something people like me genuinely crave. It really pains me to see the US fall so far behind.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/04Xr9mvEbuFE6LwHR5OkrzS-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1767985019.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 06:57:43.133737

,EPA,2026-01-11 10:15:01+00:00,The River Reporter,Advanced recycling could be America's next tech boom - The River Reporter,TAYLOR MILLARD for www.InsideSources.com,,,,,"https://riverreporter.com/stories/advanced-recycling-could-be-americas-next-tech-boom,240383","The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg.
That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.
“The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles—they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.” That’s where advanced recycling comes in.
The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.
“Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment.","Welcome to the economic future of the United States: Big Tech, Big Data—and Big… Recycling?

That’s the conclusion of a new analysis from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which says that if America dominates the coming advanced recycling industry the same way it has dominated technology, the results could be billions in economic activity and tens of thousands of jobs.

The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg. What’s needed is a new mindset. “Recycling is really manufacturing.”

Instead of looking at used plastics as a problem to be solved, he says, they should be seen as a resource to be monetized. That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.

“Mechanical recycling is tried and true,” Eisenberg said, but it can’t handle many of the most common forms of plastic. “The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles—they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.”

That’s where advanced recycling comes in. Unlike mechanical recycling, advanced recycling turns plastics into a gas or liquid raw material —“reducing them back to molecules,” Eisenberg says—which can then be turned into “brand-new plastics for use in virtually any product or packaging type, including food- and pharmaceutical-grade plastics.”

Similar to the way the mining industry supplies raw materials that are turned into consumer products, recycling plastic into its raw form can supply industries with raw materials while removing massive amounts of plastic from the waste stream.

The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.

A 2021 Government Accountability Office report touted the technology. “Chemical recycling can produce raw materials of virgin quality, thereby decreasing demand for fossil fuels and other natural resources,” the report states. “Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment. Chemical recycling creates a market for plastic waste and a new way to reuse some plastics.”

The ACC analysis suggests that widespread use of advanced recycling would create 173,200 jobs with a total annual payroll of $12.8 billion. It could also add $48.7 billion in total economic output — the combined value of goods and services produced directly and indirectly as a result.

“Essentially the same economic contributions annually of the milk industry in the United States,” Eisenberg said.

The challenge is no longer technology, but regulation, Eisenberg says. Calling the current political landscape a “plethora of regulatory barriers,” he urged state and federal governments to consider the advanced recycling of plastics as manufacturing instead of waste incineration. Any plastic produced through this process would be subject to recycling regulations.

“We think that would really help unlock some of the private investment that has been waiting to go,” he said.

The ACC is calling for a consistent national framework with clear standards, funding, incentives, infrastructure build-up and public education. Eisenberg said those standards would help with the recycling process and recycled materials, along with waste reduction.

The plastics industry still faces plenty of skepticism from environmental groups and lawmakers. Organizations such as Greenpeace USA have claimed very little plastic is being recycled, and the World Wildlife Fund has called for a ban on single-use plastic cups and cutlery by the end of the year. More than 500 U.S. communities have banned single-use plastic bags, and a dozen states have done likewise.

According to Environmental Protection Agency data, 32 percent of disposable items are recycled annually. Raising that rate to the EPA’s goal of 50 percent by 2030 will require major changes in how plastics are processed.

Critics are stuck in the past, Eisenberg says, adding that the plastics industry has changed. Plastic products are now designed with “end of life” in mind from the outset of production. It’s an approach that, with the aid of new technology, can promote recycling and stimulate the economy.

“Obviously, there’s an environmental component to this,” Eisenberg says. “We want to clean up the environment. But there’s also a jobs component to this, and we don’t want that to be ignored.”

It hasn’t worked out that way. While the Legislature enthusiastically set climate goals, and keeps raising them, there have been more disappointments than successes.

One incontestable advance is the rapid adoption of heat pumps for homes, with Maine far ahead of most states in replacing oil furnaces – once commonplace – with efficient electric units. One key point is that Gov. Mills’s predecessor, Paul LePage, also liked heat pumps, supporting the generous subsidies Efficiency Maine uses to nudge homeowners to make the investment.

On all other energy matters, LePage’s views resemble President Trump’s, whose opposition to wind, solar and energy storage has been consistent and irrational. Trump is trying to bring back coal plants, of all things, the dirtiest and most hazardous way to generate electricity. Solar and wind have long been cheaper, even displacing natural gas.

Trump has cancelled offshore wind leases in New England and tried to prevent operation of turbines ready to go, imposing enormous costs on businesses and consumers and gaining nothing. It seems Trump’s inability to shut down turbine construction off the Scottish coast near one of his golf resorts is something the entire world now has to pay for.

At least this much is clear: Whatever energy policy Trump is espousing, Maine should do the opposite. But what can be done, in the face of massive federal hostility, for at least another year and possibly three?

First, we can acknowledge Maine’s own failures in energy policy, while building on promising initiatives that need to be expanded in the next administration.

The Mills administration’s confidence in plug-in cars was misplaced. Even with significant federal subsidies for all-electric vehicles – canceled by Trump – the response of Maine consumers was tepid, and for good reason.

It turns out vehicle range is still limited enough to deter Mainers, used to long trips, from ditching gas-powered cars, since thousands of charging stations would be needed to provide an effective network. Hybrids have proven a better bet. All-electric vehicles work best in large cities, which is exactly where transportation alternatives absent in Maine are most common.

In retrospect, Mills made a big mistake in spending at least $1 billion in additional Biden administration transportation funding entirely on the highway system, not even investigating greater use of buses, trains, ferries, pedestrian access and ride-sharing. Transportation contributes 50% of greenhouse gases produced in Maine, and there’s no effective strategy to reduce it.

Other states have pursued promising ideas through their tax systems. New York City finally instituted “congestion pricing” for private vehicles entering downtown Manhattan, despite Trump’s vow to shut it down. The additional tolls are used to repair and expand bus and train lines and, if Mayor Mamdani has his way, make buses free.

Hawaii enacted a 14% “tourist tax” on cruise ships – temporarily on hold due to a Trump administration challenge – that’s explicitly designed to combat the ravages of climate disruption. Maine, meanwhile, devotes its entire gasoline tax to highway maintenance, and has kept it at a flat 30 cents throughout the LePage and Mills administrations.

Even the project of “beneficial electrification” of housing, business and industry and transportation is in jeopardy due to rapidly rising electric rates, now reaching a painful threshold for many households. Unlike discontent over consumer prices in general, often more perceived than real, Maine residential rates have shot up more than 60% in less than a decade.

Candidates campaigning to “reduce electric rates,” as LePage did, should realize it’s going to take a lot of imagination and hard work just to prevent rates from rising further. The Public Utilities Commission’s rejection of a five-year phased rate increase from Central Maine Power was widely applauded, but does nothing to alter the underlying reality that it will take investment, and lots of it, to actually achieve our energy goals.

One welcome step at the end of the Mills administration was creating a Department of Energy Resources with Cabinet status, moving it from the Governor’s office. While there’s no immediate upgrade in staff or mission, the new department could launch a truly comprehensive energy plan in the next administration.

Face it: we can’t fight Mother Nature. The public deserves real leadership from elected officials, both executive and legislative.

Trump’s flawed strategy

Like statements by other leaders with imperial ambitions, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy, published one month ago, frames the suppression of other countries as necessary: “The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a condition of our security and prosperity — a condition that allows us to assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.”

Like Putin with Ukraine, Trump sees Venezuela as his backyard. Putin invaded Ukraine, and Ukrainians still fight after four years. Now America started invading Venezuela. How can the Washington masterminds think that Venezuelans, whether they like Maduro or not, will let Americans “run” their country? Don’t Iraq and Afghanistan ring some bells in their heads?

Unappreciated architecture

In response to: “Couple rescues NC modernist home,” (12/25):

As a kid in the 1960s, I often visited the residential architecture section of our Encyclopedia Britannica, which had photos of revered houses from around the world, including TWO Matsumoto gems in Raleigh, which made the City of Oaks seem urbane. The N&O story puts the lie to that perception; for years, private citizens have had to fund and forge the redemption of Modernist masterpieces here.

If a city is lucky enough to have examples from Frank Lloyd Wright or George Matsumoto, it has an obligation to the world to keep them safe and sound. NC State University and the City of Raleigh are grossly negligent in this regard. If the Matsumoto works were not designed by an Asian American, would they be treated with more respect?

Legislative priorities

I am saddened and disgusted that our legislature has the time, wherewithal, and drive to pass yet more gender identity legislation and yet is unable to pass a budget which impacts health care, education, and compensation of teachers and other dedicated state employees. It’s time to focus on that what is important to the health and welfare of our people and state.

NC lottery problems

In response to: The NC Education Lottery’s sales are up, but schools are getting less. Let’s fix that. (Dec. 30):

Andrew Dunn’s column on the lottery was exactly on the mark, rightly noting the sordid history Democrats played in passing the lottery (I remember the vote well). Had he stopped there, I would have undoubtedly been writing in complaint. However, he continued with equal accuracy and objectivity to note that Republicans have come to embrace vice as a revenue strategy (great turn of phrase!). I also appreciated that he dug deeper to find the source of the problem (more digital games = more prizes = less money for education).

Thank you for a thoughtful, critical, and fair column.

PFAS changes

North Carolina has been particularly impacted by PFAS pollutants discharged into our drinking water sources. The EPA’s new proposal to loosen reporting requirements for businesses that make or use PFAS will harm communities in NC. A foundational element of the Clean Water Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act is accountability: A polluter needs to report on the type and amount of chemicals that it discharges. The PFAS reporting rule finalized in 2024 required companies manufacturing 6 PFAS varients between 2011 and 2022 to disclose how those chemicals were used and to provide available environmental or health data.

India sold were at 2.3 million units of electric vehicle in 2025, making up 8 per cent of all new vehicle registrations, according to a new report by the India Energy Storage Alliance, based on Vahan Portal data, cited by ANI. This boost was driven by incentives offered by the government and festive seasons. The majority portion of the sales were two-wheelers at 1.28 million units. The total registrations recorded in the overall passenger car market in the year 2025 stood at 28.2 million. Two-wheelers marked the most registrations 20 million registrations, while passenger cars were at 4.4 million and agricultural vehicles recorded 1.06 million. The recorded sales rose steadily throughout the year though slightly improved in the festival seasons due to GST benefits. Electric two-wheelers were the stars of the EV market, grabbing 57 per cent of sales. Three-wheelers came second with 0.8 million units (35 per cent), while four-wheelers logged 175,000 units. The report spotted good progress in electric delivery vehicles, especially in smaller commercial segments.Uttar Pradesh was at the forefront in this, with 400,000 units sold, taking an 18 percent market share in India's EV segment. Maharashtra followed, with 266,000 units sold, contributing 12 percent to the segment, followed by Karnataka, with 200,000 units sold, contributing 9 percent to the market. The three accounted for over 40 percent in the country's EV sales. Some smaller states recorded a very encouraging uptake of EVs. Delhi, Kerala, and Goa were able to reach an EV-to-ICE ratio of 14 percent, 12 percent, and 11 percent respectively. Meanwhile, states from the Northeast, Tripura, and Assam, achieved ratios of 18 percent and 14 percent, respectively. A major achievement was recorded in the three-wheeler segment, which attained a market penetration of 32 per cent. The government also created a record with their biggest ever order of electric buses—10,900 unit—valued at a massive Rs 10,900 crore through the PM E-DRIVE scheme. The report also stated that that while smaller vehicles led EV adoption, government efforts to electrify larger commercial vehicles and develop charging infrastructure were setting up India's EV sector for continued growth beyond 2025.

Over the past five years, the company has secured 209 megawatts of renewable energy through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements across North America and Europe. A U.S. agreement that began operating in 2024 adds to that momentum. There is also a new solar project launching in Spain in 2025.

For Montco, Merck’s sustainability strategy hits close to home. The company’s West Point campus is one of its most significant manufacturing and research hubs worldwide. This makes local operations part of a broader global push to align patient care with planetary health.

What happens next matters a lot to families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley.
That disconnect should trouble anyone who believes a public utility exists to serve the public first.
Groups like the Tennessee Utility Consumer Alliance and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy are watching closely — and so should Congress.
It will be whether families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley can rely on affordable, dependable power.","The Tennessee Valley Authority was created to serve the public, not to enrich executives or gamble with ratepayers' money. That simple truth is worth repeating right now.

After months without a quorum, TVA finally has a functioning board. The U.S. Senate has confirmed four of the five members nominated by President Donald Trump, allowing the agency to resume business that had effectively been frozen. What happens next matters a lot to families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley.

TVA is not just another utility. Since 1933, it has been a public trust, charged with delivering reliable, affordable power to a seven-state region. But in recent years, that mission has drifted. Costs have risen. Accountability has weakened. And ordinary ratepayers are being asked to shoulder the burden.

Consider this: Under former CEO Jeff Lyash, TVA paid a salary of more than $10 million a year. His successor earns less, but still an exorbitant amount. Meanwhile, TVA employees are sharing $260 million in performance bonuses this year, an average of more than $8,000 per worker, even as customers have seen base rates jump nearly 10% in just two years.

At the same time, roughly 600 employees took voluntary buyouts, including TVA's former chief nuclear officer, who received $3.3 million in compensation despite the fact that three of TVA's nuclear plants spent much of last winter offline. That is not a formula for public confidence.

TVA leadership insists big spending decisions are necessary to meet future demand. Data centers like Elon Musk's xAI are lining up for power in the Valley. Federal officials and Tennessee's senators are pushing TVA toward new nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors. On paper, these projects promise innovation and growth.

But TVA has been down this road before. In the 1970s, it embarked on an ambitious nuclear expansion plan that ballooned into more than $20 billion in debt. Seventeen reactors were planned. Only seven were completed. Ratepayers are still paying for those mistakes decades later.

Today's small modular reactors have yet to prove they can deliver power at a competitive cost. Low-income Tennesseans relying on government assistance to cover energy bills are still waiting on help halted during the federal shutdown. That disconnect should trouble anyone who believes a public utility exists to serve the public first.

TVA says it will make sure the cost of new generation doesn't land on ratepayers. But local power distributors are already being told to prepare for another rate increase. Groups like the Tennessee Utility Consumer Alliance and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy are watching closely — and so should Congress.

Both Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty have called for changes at TVA. They're right to ask hard questions. Voters may argue about many things, but they understand one reality very clearly: When the electric bill goes up, families feel it.

That's why this new board matters. Its first responsibility should be affordability and accountability. Continuing to hand out large bonuses while warning customers to brace for higher bills and potential blackouts isn't just bad optics — it's tone-deaf.

People are still grappling with inflation. Small businesses are operating on tight margins. A public utility cannot behave like a private corporation.

The path forward isn't complicated. The board must scrutinize executive compensation, demand transparency in major projects, resist unnecessary rate hikes and insist that new technologies make financial sense before ratepayers are asked to fund them.

TVA is at a crossroads. The measure of success won't be how many data centers it attracts or how big the next reactor looks on a rendering. It will be whether families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley can rely on affordable, dependable power.

That was TVA's original promise. The new board should remember it — and honor it.

More than 3,800 research grants were abruptly terminated in 2025, pulling $3 billion in active research funding from the U.S. scientific enterprise.
Driven by the influence of fossil fuel interests, nowhere is this assault more targeted than in climate science.
The Trump administration has already fired climate experts across federal agencies, terminated the National Climate Assessment, and scrubbed climate data from government websites.
Still, even as the Trump administration erodes America’s climate capacity, universities and subnational governments across the country have refused to surrender progress.","The year 2025 began with President Trump withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement — the opening salvo in what would become a concerted campaign to dismantle the nation’s ability to combat climate change. From there, the Trump administration moved aggressively to gut key emissions standards for power plants and vehicles; suspend offshore wind projects; open millions of acres of protected land for fossil fuel extraction; extend the life of dirty coal plants; and reverse key Inflation Reduction Act initiatives. By November, the value of clean energy project cancellations stood at $32 billion, and the number of clean energy jobs lost at 40,000.

These policy reversals will set back the clean energy transition and lock in fossil fuels for years, but this White House’s most enduring damage will be the destruction of the scientific infrastructure that has enabled our understanding of climate change and informed our policies to combat it. Through the disruption of research programs, shuttering of agencies and institutions, mass firings of experts, and elimination of career paths, the Trump administration is undermining climate science in ways that will hobble American competitiveness for generations.

In effect, the United States is now dismantling its own capacity to address climate change, while ceding leadership in the clean energy economy to competitors like China. More than 3,800 research grants were abruptly terminated in 2025, pulling $3 billion in active research funding from the U.S. scientific enterprise. Each canceled grant represents years of painstaking work abandoned, research teams left without salaries, and important breakthrough discoveries that may now never happen. Universities across the country have also faced the effects of political influence on science, corrupting what was once determined by peer review and injecting political ideology into scientific funding decisions. Driven by the influence of fossil fuel interests, nowhere is this assault more targeted than in climate science. The Trump administration has already fired climate experts across federal agencies, terminated the National Climate Assessment, and scrubbed climate data from government websites. Most alarming is the announced closure of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a cornerstone institution that develops the world’s most widely used atmospheric and climate models, now branded a source of “climate alarmism.” The administration has also threatened to close federal atmospheric research offices and regional climate adaptation centers, which communities depend on to prepare for climate impacts.

The intentional damage extends beyond research; it also devastates the pipeline of future scientists who would normally drive American climate innovation. Universities have curtailed PhD admissions, paused offers to prospective students, and limited fellowships. Early career researchers face funding uncertainty and the prospect of being forced out of the field. The climate of instability and political interference is causing young people who are committed to pursuing climate science careers to reconsider their paths entirely, calculating that a system where research funding depends on political winds rather than scientific merit does not offer them a secure future. Anecdotes of researchers considering leaving the U.S. for more supportive environments abound. And as America drives its brightest minds away or abroad, China doubles down on research investment, racing ahead in an industrial transformation that dominates global electric vehicle markets and clean technology manufacturing.

Still, even as the Trump administration erodes America’s climate capacity, universities and subnational governments across the country have refused to surrender progress. Some universities have engaged in litigation to overturn funding cuts and have invested some of their endowments into research programs to sustain critical work. Climate coalitions of state-level governments and academic institutions have announced reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 24% below 2005 levels, while continuing to grow local economies. Committed states have achieved roughly 45% reductions in electricity sector emissions through cleaner power generation, and many have enacted binding clean electricity standards that lock in their progress.

The damage Trump is inflicting on American climate science will reverberate for decades. The lost discoveries, ignored human talent, and ceded global leadership will not be recovered quickly. However, the resistance from states, cities, and universities reveals that American climate progress is resilient. It will be up to us to sustain this momentum until federal policy realigns with reality.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/DSGDU6KWDZBNXJ3PQU3WKGEDG4.jpg?auth=cfb7ebb37e5b7b3e34480f6792b573a5331e578274cb623e956e529bd8486e81&width=1200,N,,2026-01-11 00:58:00.842489

It was fresh, it was entirely new and it was late November, 2021 – although the car had actually been in production since early 2020.

In fact, the production version was officially unveiled in February, 2019 and made its first public appearance at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show that month.

Yes, it’s been updated since then, but that’s still an awfully long time in the electric vehicle universe which is evolving and expanding at an exponentially rapid rate.

Polestar by the way is an offshoot of Volvo, now owned by the Chinese conglomerate Geely and the cars, or ours at least, are manufactured in China. It also has a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina, presumably to keep Mr Trump happy, but it must be more costly to make vehicles there.

So, does the Polestar 2 still cut it?

STYLING

A facelifted Polestar 2 was revealed in January, 2023 when rear-wheel drive was adopted as the default.

The entry grade was previously front-drive.

The single motor model was also upgraded to produce 223kW of power and 489Nm of torque, resulting in a faster 0-100km/h time of 6.2 seconds.

Dual-motor models received a boost to 314kW and 740Nm, with 0-100km/h reduced to just 4.5 seconds.

At this time the long-range battery was also upgraded to a capacity of 82kWh.

Since then, however, power outputs have been adjusted to produce a clear, linear progression through the range, starting at 200kW and topping out at 350kW.

The upgrade saw the original mesh grille replaced by a blanked-out version, with an array of sensors and a camera in the centre.

The single motor, standard range is $55,509 driveaway, the long-range single motor version is $74,619 and the long range, dual motor, all-wheel drive is $81,444.

Metallic paint is standard and all models start with the same basic range of equipment.

You can crank the vibe up a notch or two with the addition of various option packs.

Our test vehicle this time around was the Polestar 2 long range single motor version, with a recommended retail price of $66,400 before on-roads and claimed range of 659km – that’s better than some conventional cars.

Standard kit includes embossed, textured textile trim and two-zone filtered air with vents for the rear seats.

Driver and front passenger seats are heated and partly power adjustable, with four-way power lumbar adjustment for the driver. The angle of the seatback must be adjusted manually.

The car rides on 19-inch alloys with wheel covers and has touch-operated locking with puddle lights, LED headlights with active beam, adaptive rear LED lights, retractable frameless mirrors, auto lights and wipers, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, front and rear park sensors and a foot-operated tailgate.

Additional features can be added with the addition of accessory packs: Climate Pack ($1500), Pro ($1900), Plus ($4700) or Performance ($8990).

Pilot Pack which was $3400 is now standard, which means Blind Spot is now standard, begging the question: why is it still listed at all?

Among other things the Climate Pack adds an energy saving heat pump.

Pro adds 20-inch graphite wheels, gold valve caps and black seat belts with a Swedish gold stripe.

Plus brings a raft of features for the price including a full-length glass roof, Harman Kardon sound and a power-operated tailgate.

The Performance Pack is available only with Long Range Dual Motor that has been fitted with the Plus Pack, and not relevant to our review.

Buying a Polestar is a bit different. The whole process takes place online from ordering to payment.

What about a test drive, I hear you ask? You can book that here, either at a designated ‘space’ in each capital city or location requested by you.

Polestar offers a five-year five warranty, along with five years complimentary servicing and roadside assistance.

The battery is covered by an eight-year/160,000km warranty.

Generally, Polestar 2 doesn’t need to be serviced for up to two years or 30,000km.

INFOTAINMENT

Polestar 2 is the first car to come with a built-in Google operating system.

Infotainment is controlled from an 11.2-inch portrait-style touchscreen, now looking somewhat small in comparison to competitors.

High Performance Audio delivers 250 watts through eight speakers, including a bass-boosting air woofer mounted under the bonnet.

The OS includes Google Assistant, Google Maps, with charging options and Google Play Store, which offers optimised in-car apps for seamless integration (with Gemini coming).

There’s also Bluetooth, wi-fi hotspot, FM and DAB+ digital radio, but no AM band – so no emergency broadcasts in tunnels.

Android Auto is supported as is Apple CarPlay, but neither is wireless.

The system is connected to the net via 4G and receives over-the-air updates like a phone.

It will even make an automatic emergency call in the event of an accident (or if the car has been stolen).

Connected Services are complimentary for 12 months but after that you will have to pay to continue using them.

There are two USB Type-C ports in front and two more in the rear of the car, with a 12-volt socket for the luggage area.

You can use the ports to charge your compatible devices, but they do not offer a data connection.

SAFETY

Polestar 2 gets a full five-star crash rating from ANCAP, with a rear-view camera and eight airbags including a centre airbag.

There’s also autonomous emergency braking (Car-to-Car, Vulnerable Road User and Junction Assist) as well as a lane support system with lane keep assist (LKA), lane departure warning (LDW) and emergency lane keeping (ELK), and an advanced speed assistance system (SAS).

Surprisingly, there’s no head-up display for the windscreen.

ENGINES/TRANSMISSIONS

With a 82 kWh Lithium-ion battery, 79 kWh of which is useable, the electric powertrain in this particular model produces 220kW of power and 490Nm of torque, with drive to the rear wheels through a single reduction gear transmission.

DRIVING

Polestar 2 is described as a fastback, but liftback is closer to the mark.

It’s just over 4.6 metres in length, just under 2.0 metres wide with mirrors and has a 2735mm wheelbase.

The sloping tailgate lifts to reveal a long but shallow luggage area, with another hidden area underneath and 407 litres of luggage space.

A small front boot or ‘froot’ is hidden under the bonnet, with a capacity of 43 litres and is handy for storing cables.

There’s no exterior release for the boot which is somewhat annoying as you fumble for the key fob.

You won’t find a spare tyre either with a puncture repair kit provided in the event of a flat.

The 2 was designed by Thomas Ingenlath alongside the Volvo XC40 with which it shares a platform.

The decision to incorporate a radiator grille was a good one because it gave the car a classy look.

The removal of the grille with the latest update, replacing it with a solid panel was a retrograde step in our opinion.

Inside, the fit out is Swedish and minimalist, with grey wood veneer trim and a cabin that has a light airy ambience.

So far so good, but coming from an SUV, the cockpit feels a bit cramped and lacks storage space, with only a small console box.

Much of the available space is given over to the wireless phone charger, which tended to heat up our phones.

Two cupholders are provided, but they are end to end. One is covered by the sliding lid of the console box, and not very practical – back seat passengers get the standard two.

I’m 183cm and my feet kept getting tangled with the foot pedals getting in and out of the car.

Rear legroom is not as generous as you might expect.

Air outlets are provided but the rear windows only partially wind down.

The dash from 0-100km/h takes 6.2 seconds which is pretty quick.

Energy consumption is claimed at 15.8 kWh/100km and the long-range single motor test vehicle has a claimed range of 659km (WLTP).

That’s commensurate with a conventional ICE vehicle, but of course it takes much longer to fill up.

The test vehicle displayed an initial range of 520km while a full overnight recharge upped this to 530km, still 130km short of its supposed range? We were getting 14.9 kWh/100km after 550km of driving.

It took us a while to find the trip metre.

Charging takes as little as 28 minutes using a public, high-powered DC fast charger or eight hours with a home Wallbox – that is if you have three-phase power.

We’ve yet to find a charger that can deliver this kind of speed, even with a bank of Tesla Superchargers just down the road.

The car is supplied with a ‘granny’ or home charge cable, but this can take up to 41 hours for a full charge from a 10A household power point.

Most manufacturers are no longer supplying additional cables as charging stations provide their own (just like a petrol station).

It’s easy to become fixated on range, but it is not really an issue with an EV such as the long range, single motor model, provided you have ready access to a charger when required.

Like Volvos there’s no key or start button. Just hop in, put your foot on the brake, put it into drive and off you go.

Acceleration is quick, but not lightning quick. It’s fast enough however to make you think you’re behind the wheel of something special.

Helping to keep the battery topped up is regenerative braking, which reclaims power when the car is travelling downhill.

You can choose between two levels of regenerative braking or adopt one-pedal mode where there’s no need to apply the brakes.

Just lifting off the accelerator brings the car to a stop. It takes some practice, but may not be to everyone’s liking.

The car weighs over two tonnes, but has a low centre of gravity which helps it sit flat in corners. The weight also impacts the suspension, taking a little longer to respond to bumps.

The ride is sporty. Think Euro firm, but we didn’t find it jarring on our test circuit through the backlots.

But all-in-all the handling is surefooted and it does not become unsettled by unexpected bumps mid-corner like some cars.

Of note be sure you shut the doors properly as the car failed to lock with a door slightly ajar (and did not supply a warning).

We had a running battle with the Google operating system.

We could connect to Android Auto only with the original cable that came with our Google Pixel and both our phones (Pixels) failed repeatedly to reconnect on re-entry.

Google Maps is the default for navigation, but we prefer the more user-friendly Waze which also supports speed camera warnings.

Navigating with Android Auto saw the car totally lose the plot in one of Sydney’s many tunnels.

It’s okay when it works.

SUMMING UP

Polestar 2 remains a favourite, but it has lost the instant appeal that it once had.

It continues however to offer a tight, sporty drive, or very sporty in the case of the dual motor, all-wheel drive version with the works.

At the same time, it’s difficult to believe that the first car to get the complete Google operating system does not support wireless CarPlay or Android Auto, and that it is very picky about the cable you use – that brings back memories.

Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition The Piedmont Environmental Council and nearly 30 environmental, preservation, and climate advocacy groups formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition in late 2023.","The demise of the coal industry left much of Appalachia in economic tatters, with lost jobs, spoiled water, and depopulated communities across the coalfields of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. Now, in an ironic twist of the region’s energy history, tech companies and data center developers are eyeing these same rural landscapes with ambitious plans to power the artificial intelligence revolution.

From the hollows of Tucker County, West Virginia, to the former strip mines of Wise County, Virginia, proposals for massive data center complexes are sparking both hope and fierce resistance. Proponents promise economic revitalization and tax revenues for struggling communities. Critics warn of environmental degradation, soaring utility bills for residents, limited job creation, and the stripping away of local control over development decisions.

The stakes are enormous. According to a September 2025 report from the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia initiative, approximately 92 gigawatts of data center capacity are currently in the pipeline across the United States, with seven gigawatts being added monthly by the end of 2024. Traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” are becoming saturated, pushing growth toward rural regions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky.

Where Data Centers Stand Today

Northern Virginia remains the undisputed capital of the data center world, with roughly 300 operational facilities across Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties. Northern Virginia is one of the world’s largest internet interconnection hubs. But capacity constraints and community opposition are forcing the industry to look elsewhere. West Virginia has thrown out the largest welcome mat in the region.

In Appalachia proper, data center development remains nascent but is accelerating rapidly. Southwest Virginia’s Wise County hosts the Mineral Gap Data Center, which came online in 2023 and is powered by a 3.4-megawatt solar array built on former strip-mined land—widely promoted as the first abandoned mine land converted to solar in Virginia. OnePartner ATAC runs a facility in Duffield, Virginia.

In January 2025, developers announced plans for Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center in Louisville, a 400-megawatt campus to be developed by PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies, with utility service from Louisville Gas and Electric. The Lane Report noted the project is expected to begin operations by late 2026. It will likely represent a demonstration of what can be exported to Eastern Kentucky.

Southwest Virginia’s Growing Pipeline

Beyond the Wise County proposals, data center interest is spreading across Southwest Virginia, often into communities with minimal regulatory frameworks to evaluate such projects.

In early December 2025, Wythe County announced its first data center: a 99-acre AI computing campus at Progress Park to be developed by Solis Arx, a newly formed digital infrastructure company led by CEO Rob Noll. Cardinal News reported that county officials project the facility will represent more than $1 billion in total investment. County Administrator Stephen Bear told the Wythe County Board of Supervisors that the project would generate more than $10 million in annual tax revenue by 2028, making Solis Arx the county’s single largest taxpayer.

The company claims its facility will consume only about 2,000 gallons of water daily—roughly equivalent to a restaurant—by using closed-loop and air-based cooling systems rather than the evaporative cooling that can require hundreds of thousands of gallons per day at older facilities. Appalachian Power will provide electricity, with water supplied by the town of Wytheville.

At a December 9, 2025 board meeting covered by Cardinal News, nearly all of the dozen residents who spoke during public comment opposed the project or raised concerns about electricity rates, water supplies, environmental impacts, and the loss of rural character. Resident Hannah Ainsworth questioned the trajectory of such development: “It’s 99 acres proposed today, but what about next year, in three years? At what point is our region unrecognizable?”

Board of Supervisors Chairman Brian Vaught acknowledged a significant vulnerability in how such projects arrive. Wythe County is one of approximately seven Virginia counties that lack zoning ordinances governing where data centers can be built. “So until that’s addressed, if you don’t live in the town of Wytheville or the town of Rural Retreat, one of these could pop up as your neighbor,” Vaught said, according to Cardinal News.

Pulaski County may not be far behind. The 2025 Virginia General Assembly allocated $15 million for site readiness improvements—including road extensions, grading, and natural gas pipeline work—to support what budget documents describe as “up to $3.0 billion in capital investment” through construction of a data center and power plant. The project remains under nondisclosure agreements, with no developer publicly identified, according to Inside Climate News and Cardinal News.

Montgomery County supervisors are also weighing the issue. Cardinal News reported in mid-December 2025 that local officials are considering commissioning a study on data center zoning—a sign that even communities without active proposals recognize the need to prepare for an industry expanding rapidly across the region.

The Wise County Vision: Mine Water Cooling

One of the most ambitious proposals involves transforming 65,000 acres of former coal mining land in Wise County, Virginia, into an energy hub including data centers. A nonprofit venture called Energy DELTA Lab, managed by Will Clear and Will Payne, envisions building a massive 450-acre “Data Center Ridge” on top of old mining lands that could be powered and cooled using billions of gallons of water that naturally replenish in abandoned underground mines.

In a December 2025 report, the Thomson Reuters Foundation detailed how the entrepreneurs hope to prove the feasibility of their idea to Texas-based Energy Transfer, which owns the land managed by Penn Virginia Operating Co. Unlike neighboring areas plagued by acid mine drainage, the Wise County coalfields lack the mineral pyrite that contaminates water. The underground mine water maintains a temperature of 55 degrees or below, roughly 10 to 15 degrees cooler than river water typically used for data center cooling elsewhere in Virginia.

Payne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the water quality makes the site attractive for data center cooling. He acknowledged, however, that the region faces deep skepticism about outside development. “Anyone looking at expanding in the region, there is skepticism because there have been so many stories of promises made but not kept,” Payne said, according to the Reuters report.

Canary Media reported in September 2024 that tax revenues from data centers could help address the region’s fiscal crisis. Will Clear told Canary Media that local government finances face an existential threat without new development. The Virginia Mercury reported in July 2024 that a 36-megawatt data center could provide about $464 million in capital investment and create approximately 40 high-income jobs.

West Virginia’s Controversial Push

West Virginia has become the most aggressive state in pursuing data center development, passing sweeping legislation in April 2025 that strips local governments of regulatory authority over such projects. House Bill 2014, championed by Governor Patrick Morrisey as the centerpiece of his economic development agenda, prohibits counties and municipalities from enforcing zoning ordinances, permitting requirements, noise regulations, or code enforcement on certified microgrid districts or “high-impact” data center projects.

The law also diverts most property tax revenue from data centers away from local taxing bodies to state coffers. Under the final version, only 30% of property tax proceeds go to the host county, with five percent divided among the state’s other 54 counties. The West Virginia Gazette-Mail reported that this formula is estimated to cost counties and school districts millions of dollars.

Upon the bill’s passage, Morrisey declared it “the economic development bill of the session,” according to the Gazette-Mail. “West Virginia is America’s energy state, and this law is going to demonstrate it to the whole country that we are ready for action,” Morrisey said in a statement reported by Mountain State Spotlight.

At least four major data center projects are now publicly known in West Virginia. The most controversial involves Fundamental Data LLC, a Virginia-based company seeking to build a 1,656-megawatt natural gas power plant and data center complex on 500 acres between the towns of Thomas and Davis in Tucker County. The Wall Street Journal reported that the proposed facility could eventually span 10,000 acres across Tucker and Grant counties if fully realized.

Kentucky: Multiple Proposals, Growing Debate

Kentucky’s data center conversation has moved quickly from possibility to reality. Beyond the Louisville hyperscale campus, the Kentucky Lantern reported in August 2025 on a proposed multi-billion-dollar “technology campus” with data centers in Mason County, though key details remain thin, and local reaction has included both hope and skepticism.

In Oldham County, Louisville Public Media reported that residents organized against a proposed hyperscale data center, and the controversy has become a statewide case study in zoning disputes, noise concerns, and rural quality-of-life politics. The fight illustrates how quickly economic development proposals can become community flashpoints when a hyperscale project lands on rural ground.

The Economic Equation

The Promise of Tax Revenue

Proponents argue that data centers represent one of the few realistic options for diversifying Appalachian economies devastated by coal’s decline. The numbers from Virginia’s experience are eye-catching. According to Loudoun County officials quoted by the Citizens Voice in December 2025, data centers generate 35 to 40% of the county’s General Fund revenue, with fiscal contributions jumping from $1 million in fiscal year 2018 to $875 million in 2024. That figure is projected to reach $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2026.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study cited by Virginia Business found that between 2017 and 2021, data centers contributed $54.2 billion to Virginia’s gross domestic product. Southwest Virginia localities have positioned themselves to capture some of this wealth by implementing the state’s lowest regional property tax rate on data center equipment at 24 cents per $100 of assessed value, compared to $3.70 in Prince William County, according to Virginia Business.

The Jobs Question

Critics contend that data centers deliver far fewer permanent jobs than their industrial footprint suggests. According to an October 2025 report from ReImagine Appalachia, most data center employment is in construction, and those jobs are often contracted from outside the communities where facilities are built.

A typical data center adds up to 1,500 workers during construction but employs only about 50 full-time workers when operational, according to a 2024 Virginia state report cited by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Those permanent positions are primarily security or janitorial staff.

At an April 2025 town hall meeting in Davis, West Virginia, covered by 100 Days in Appalachia, electrical engineer Brian Reed—whose family has been in Tucker County since 1896—challenged the jobs pitch. “$12 an hour isn’t a job, you can’t survive,” Reed said. “The operators in the plant where I work make $43 an hour. That’s a job that makes a difference. So don’t offer jobs that are for security people that are going to starve to death.”

Nationwide, data center employment grew from 306,000 to 501,000 workers between 2016 and 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But more than 40% of those jobs are concentrated in just three states, far from Appalachia’s coalfields, as reported by West Virginia Watch.

Environmental Concerns

The Water Challenge

Data centers rank among the top ten water-consuming commercial industries in the United States. A medium-sized facility can consume around 110 million gallons of water annually for cooling, with some consuming up to 5 million gallons daily, according to a report from the University of Tulsa. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute reported that data centers in Northern Virginia collectively consumed nearly 2 billion gallons of water in 2023, a 63% increase from 2019.

Water consumption varies significantly based on cooling technology. Evaporative or wet cooling requires substantial water withdrawals and raises concerns in drought-prone areas like Maricopa County, Arizona, which has been inundated by data center developments. Air cooling reduces water needs but increases electricity consumption. The Wise County proposal’s closed-loop mine-water cooling approach attempts to change the equation by using cool underground mine water as a heat sink, potentially eliminating dependence on surface water or municipal systems.

Water concerns are particularly acute in some Appalachian locations. Tucker County, West Virginia, suffered through a severe drought in 2024 that forced emergency water pumping from the Blackwater River. 100 Days in Appalachia reported that in neighboring Thomas, the reservoir reached its lowest level in 60 years, rendering water unusable due to high iron concentrations.

In a December 2025 Brookings Institution podcast, Davis Mayor Al Tomson expressed concern about cumulative water impacts. “We’ve suffered a drought for the last two summers,” Tomson said. “We’ve had to go to our secondary water source, which is the Blackwater River. But if the data centers start drawing water out of the aquifer... I’m concerned that it’s gonna affect the source water for the creek that we’re using right now.”

Noise Pollution

The constant hum of cooling systems and backup generators has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for communities living near data centers. According to TechTarget, facilities produce noise levels between 55 and 85 decibels from cooling fans, mechanical chillers, and ventilation systems—sounds that are particularly intrusive in rural areas where residents moved seeking quiet.

In Northern Virginia, Amazon Web Services data centers near the Great Oak subdivision in Manassas have drawn persistent complaints. WUSA9 reported that residents describe the sound as a low roar combined with a high-pitched whir. “These data centers are loud, noisy beasts, and they are being built too close to residential areas,” community activist Roger Yackel told WUSA9. “That’s not something that we should have to live with.”

The Prince William Times reported in December 2022 that noise remediation can cost millions of dollars, and unless regulators apply pressure, companies may be slow to implement solutions. In Tucker County, the prospect of constant industrial noise near the tourist towns of Davis and Thomas—known for stargazing, hiking, and natural beauty—has fueled fierce opposition.

Air Quality and Diesel Risk

Large data centers typically rely on diesel backup generators that produce air pollution during testing and emergencies. The Parsons Advocate of Tucker County reported that the Fundamental Data project there would include 30 million gallons of diesel fuel storage to back up its natural gas power plant.

The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality permit for the Tucker County facility in August 2025 over strenuous community objections. The Intermountain newspaper in Elkins, West Virginia, reported that more than 1,600 written comments were submitted during the public comment period.

“We are extremely disappointed that the West Virginia DEP really isn’t upholding their mission to protect our air, land, and water,” Nikki Forrester of Tucker United told The Intermountain. “They discussed at the public meeting that they’ve never rejected an air quality permit before.”

Community Backlash: Three Overlapping Camps

Across Appalachia, community reactions to data center proposals tend to fall into three overlapping camps. The first is the development coalition: county officials, industrial development authorities, some trades, landowners, and utilities who argue that data centers represent a once-in-a-generation chance to replace the coal-era tax base and keep young people local.

The second is the quality-of-life coalition: nearby residents, tourism businesses, and preservation groups focused on noise, light pollution, traffic, and land conversion. The third is the accountability coalition: people who might tolerate a project if rules are strict, demanding transparency about corporate identity, enforceable limits, and binding community benefits.

In Pittsylvania County, Virginia, grassroots organizing successfully blocked Balico LLC’s proposal to build what would have been Virginia’s largest natural gas power plant at 3,500 megawatts alongside a hyperscale data center campus.

In Tucker County, residents formed Tucker United within weeks of learning about the Fundamental Data proposal. West Virginia Watch reported that the group now counts hundreds of members. “No Data Center in Tucker County” signs have proliferated in windows, storefronts, and on vehicles throughout Davis and Thomas.

One recurring complaint involves the lack of transparency from developers. Fundamental Data’s air permit application was heavily redacted, with the company claiming confidential business information. The firm’s public website consists only of a logo and a copyright notice, as noted by 100 Days in Appalachia.

“The company hasn’t come down and spoken with us at all,” Forrester told Corporate Crime Reporter in August 2025. “From a local leadership standpoint, none of us were aware that this was even a possibility. It feels like it’s a power grab where they want to get rid of any local control, take the money, and leave West Virginians to suffer.”

WVVA reported in April 2025 that more than 1,000 West Virginians signed a petition asking Governor Morrisey to veto HB 2014. He signed it anyway.

Utility Companies in the Mix

This is not just a technology story—it’s a utility planning story. Several major utilities are positioning themselves to serve the anticipated data center boom in Appalachia.

American Electric Power, the parent company of Appalachian Power in West Virginia and Kentucky Power in eastern Kentucky, has emerged as a key player. Data Center Dynamics reported in February 2025 that AEP expects to bring 4.7 gigawatts of new data center capacity online in 2025 alone and has customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030.

Louisville Gas and Electric will serve Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center campus. Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility and the company most directly tied to Northern Virginia’s data center concentration, is expanding infrastructure across the Commonwealth. In Southwest Virginia, Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy provide electricity to the region where the Energy DELTA Lab project is proposed.

FirstEnergy has announced $15 billion for power infrastructure investments to support data center growth, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report. The company serves customers across Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator covering much of coal-country Appalachia, has become central to debates about supply, demand, and rate impacts. West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported that projected data center load growth far exceeds new supply coming online in the near term.

Will Electric Bills Rise?

The short answer appears to be yes, and in some cases dramatically. Data center demand has already contributed to soaring wholesale electricity prices across the PJM Interconnection, the regional grid that serves West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other mid-Atlantic states. Stories of ratepayer protests about rising electricity prices are appearing all across the mountains.

Mountain State Spotlight reported in October 2025 that the cost to secure an adequate power supply in PJM’s annual capacity auction jumped from $2.2 billion for 2024-2025 to $14.7 billion for 2025-2026, an increase of more than 500%. CNBC reported that an independent monitor found data center demand, both actual and forecast, accounted for $9.3 billion, or 63%, of that total. In the December 2025 auction, prices hit $16.4 billion, with PJM falling short of its reliability target for the first time. Nearly all of the 5,250-megawatt increase in projected demand was attributable to data centers.

Monitoring Analytics, a specialized firm that acts as an independent monitor for the PJM Interconnection, said in its June report: “Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.”

These costs are spread across the entire grid, affecting ratepayers throughout the region. CNBC reported in November 2025 that residential electricity prices surged 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois, and 12% in Ohio during a recent 12-month period, well above the six percent national average.

A Harvard Law School study released in September 2025 warned that utilities may be subsidizing data center growth by shifting infrastructure costs to residential and other ratepayers. The Union of Concerned Scientists reached a similar conclusion in an October 2025 analysis: “The wealthiest companies are building extraordinarily expensive data centers that you and I are subsidizing.”

Cathy Kunkel, an energy consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Mountain State Spotlight: “One of the principles of electric rate regulation is that the entity that’s imposing cost on the system bears those costs to the extent possible. The historical way transmission cost allocation has been done is just not keeping up with that principle when it comes to data centers.”

Corporate Players in Appalachia

Two overlapping groups of corporations are driving the data center push into Appalachia. The first consists of hyperscalers—the companies whose cloud and AI services create the underlying demand: Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Even when they aren’t named publicly, they often sit behind developer NDAs or vague references to “Fortune 100” clients, as the Kentucky Lantern has noted in its coverage.

Amazon Web Services has the largest data center footprint nationally, with hundreds of facilities in Northern Virginia alone. Google has committed $25 billion for data centers and infrastructure, including a $3 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management for hydropower electricity, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report.

The second group consists of developers, landholders, and power partners—the visible local actors. PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies are developing Kentucky’s first hyperscale campus in Louisville. Compass Datacenters and QTS Data Centers are building the Prince William Digital Gateway in Virginia, billed as the world’s largest future data center complex at 23 million square feet, according to Virginia Business.

In West Virginia, Fundamental Data LLC of Purcellville, Virginia, is pursuing the massive Tucker County project. TransGas Development Systems of New York is proposing two off-grid power plants in Mingo County for what the applications call the “Adams Fork Data Center Energy Campus,” according to Mountain State Spotlight. Texas-based Fidelis New Energy has proposed a data center complex in Mason County.

In early December, ten Mingo County residents filed a federal lawsuit seeking to halt the Adams Fork project, alleging violations of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.

Questions Communities Should Ask

What Advocacy Groups Recommend

Several organizations have developed frameworks to help communities evaluate data center proposals and advocate for responsible development. Their recommendations share common themes: transparency, local control, binding commitments, and protection for existing residents and ratepayers.

Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition

The Piedmont Environmental Council and nearly 30 environmental, preservation, and climate advocacy groups formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition in late 2023. Julie Bolthouse, the Council’s director of land use, told Inside Climate News in December 2023 that an “ever-increasing data center footprint” has resulted in “higher utility rates, new transmission lines, declining air quality, reduced water supply,” and a loss in Virginia’s “hard-fought climate goals.”

The coalition has articulated four pillars of reform. The first is enhanced transparency, requiring disclosure and statewide reporting on data center energy use, water consumption, and emissions. The second is state oversight, establishing state-level regulatory review to evaluate regional impacts. The third is ratepayer protection, safeguarding residents and businesses from subsidizing billions of dollars in infrastructure that data centers require. The fourth is incentivizing sustainability by connecting tax exemptions to clean energy and efficiency standards.

“There needs to be more transparency around this industry; we need to know how much energy, how much water, and their emissions,” Bolthouse told Data Center Dynamics in November 2024. “Our localities are ill-equipped to handle the regional implications that are coming from these massive projects.”

PennFuture’s Model Ordinance

PennFuture, a Pennsylvania environmental nonprofit, has created a model zoning ordinance and educational video series to help municipalities prepare for data center development. The organization developed its model after reviewing ordinances passed in Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia.

The model ordinance addresses water consumption, power consumption, noise, and aesthetic concerns. According to PennFuture’s website, “Municipalities must take seriously their responsibility to plan for this new land use and avoid being caught unaware, as many were when the distribution center boom struck Pennsylvania in recent years.”

Donna Kohut of PennFuture told the Republican Herald in August 2025 that Pennsylvania faces serious risks from legislation that would fast-track data center approvals. “By allowing developers to side-step critical and constitutionally required environmental protections, our elected officials would be allowing for unfettered destruction of Pennsylvania’s natural resources and risking the health of our local communities,” Kohut said.

ReImagine Appalachia

ReImagine Appalachia, a coalition focused on sustainable economic development in the Ohio River Valley, published a report in October 2025 titled “Is Responsible Data Center Development Possible?” The report argues that data centers can benefit communities if proper safeguards are implemented.

The organization recommends that data centers be located on shuttered industrial facilities rather than greenfields, ideally co-located with factories or greenhouses that can benefit from waste heat recovery. Components should be procured locally to contribute to the region’s manufacturing sector. Strong labor standards should ensure local workers are hired in development and construction, including prevailing wage requirements, project labor agreements, and registered apprenticeship programs.

“Attracting new industries to our communities should not be a race to the bottom,” ReImagine Appalachia wrote. “The new growth of data centers in the region is a call to assess how our policy models have historically favored economic and project development that benefits extractive, exploitative, absentee corporations at the expense of our communities, workers, and lands.”

NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Principles

In September 2025, the NAACP and environmental justice advocates released guiding principles for data center development following a convening in Memphis, Tennessee, of nearly 70 climate and community advocates. The gathering was prompted in part by concerns about Elon Musk’s xAI data center in South Memphis, which the NAACP has challenged legally over unpermitted gas turbines in a historically Black neighborhood.

The NAACP’s framework demands that companies disclose water and energy consumption, emissions, subsidies, and corporate ownership details as soon as they propose new projects. Energy efficiency standards and environmental commitments must become legally binding through community benefit agreements.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP stated in the principles, as reported by The Verge. Abre’ Conner, director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at the NAACP, told The Verge that the principles put tech companies “on alert” that “if they do not meet our demands... we move into other forms of advocacy, including filing litigation.”

An Uncertain Future

The data center rush into Appalachia encapsulates the region’s century-long struggle with extractive industries and outside development. Like coal before it, data centers promise jobs and prosperity while communities worry about bearing the environmental and social costs.

Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at the Piedmont Environmental Council, offered a warning to West Virginia Watch in June 2025: “What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia. The players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities.”

The U.S. Department of Energy projects that data centers could consume between 6.7 and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. That growth will require new power generation somewhere, and Appalachia’s abundant natural gas, available land, and water resources make it attractive despite the challenges.

Whether the region can chart a different path than its coal experience remains to be seen. The battles playing out in Tucker County, Wise County, Wythe County, and communities across the region will help determine whether data centers become genuine engines of renewal or simply the latest chapter in Appalachia’s long history of extraction without lasting benefit.

As one Tucker County resident put it at an April town hall covered by 100 Days in Appalachia: “It’s been so long and such a hard fight, and then all of a sudden it feels like this is gonna kick the legs out from the stool from everything that’s already here.”

In the EU and the U.S., fossil fuel interests have regained the upper hand.
Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse.
From the outset, the fossil fuel industry has managed to defame climate protection as a burden on the economy.
But even many climate activists have adopted the fossil fuel industry’s framing and talked about burden-sharing in climate protection.","Since Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government has been more aggressively boosting fossil fuels to exert geopolitical dominance. President Donald Trump stated unequivocally that the military assault on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife are aimed at gaining control of the country’s oil reserves. Meanwhile, oil company shares are soaring, a dividend on the investments of “Big Oil,” the major donor to Trump’s election campaign. It is also no coincidence that Nigeria (which the U.S. bombed over Christmas) and Iran and Greenland, which Trump repeatedly threatens, are oil-rich regions, too.

While the U.S. is focusing on fossil fuel extraction, a dramatic transformation is taking place worldwide. In China, CO2 emissions have been stagnating or declining for over a year and a half. The expansion of global renewable energy capacity reached an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) last year. USD 2.4 trillion was invested in the energy transition, a third of which went into renewables. These are historic records, even if they are not enough to achieve the goal set at COP28 in Dubai: tripling the installed capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030.

Against this backdrop, climate and energy expert Hans-Josef Fell sees the world at a crossroads. Opting for fossil fuels not only leads to planetary catastrophe, but it is also economically misguided, he says.

Hans-Josef Fell was a member of the German Bundestag from 1998 to 2013. As a leading climate figure of the Green Party, Fell helped to advance the energy transition in Germany. He was a drafter of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), a law that came into force in Germany 25 years ago and has been copied by more than 60 countries. EEG promotes renewable energies (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and guarantees their preferential feed-in to the power grid as well as fixed feed-in tariffs (which provide above-market prices) in order to drive forward expansion and shape the energy transition.

Today, Fell is president of the Energy Watch Group, an international network of scientists and parliamentarians researching fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources, and, together with climate activists such as Bill McKibben, is an advocate for 100 percent renewable energy. In this interview, Fell discusses the widespread rollback of climate policies, how to transition to a zero-emission economy, and how investment in renewable energy is driving China’s economic boom.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

David Goeßmann: While greenhouse gases continue to rise to record levels globally, the U.S. is still the second-largest emitter in absolute terms, but with much higher per capita consumption and historical emissions than China. President Donald Trump has reversed the steps toward energy transition initiated under the Biden administration, attacked all environmental protection measures, and issued thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits while U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are going up again. In Europe, we see a boom of fossil gas and gas-fired power plants while overall climate policy is in decline. For instance, the German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz watered down the European Union’s (EU) climate targets and undermined the EU’s ban on combustion engines from 2035. The EU has also weakenedthe so-called Green New Deal. How do you assess climate protection in the industrialized world?

Hans-Josef Fell: There is no climate protection worthy of the name in the rich countries, nor globally. The Earth’s temperature is accelerating toward three degrees Celsius by 2050, as new calculations by the German Meteorological Society and the German Physical Society show. The Energy Watch Group has also clearly described this; one only has to extrapolate the current path of exponentially rising temperatures from the last 20 years.

This alarming result is also clear, because as early as 1990, the limit of 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is sustainable for human civilization was exceeded. Today, the atmosphere is already overloaded with almost 430 ppm. An effective climate protection target that could enable the planet, which is already overheated by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, to cool down can therefore only be to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (not to be confused with annual emissions!) to below 350 ppm. This can only be achieved if all emissions are stopped in about two decades and, at the same time, huge amounts of carbon are removed from the atmosphere. The anti-climate measures mentioned above and many others are irresponsibly counterproductive, as they even reward new increased emissions with tax breaks and, with tax subsidies, even promote the expansion of highly climate-damaging natural gas power plants and natural gas infrastructure. At the same time, these tax breaks for climate polluters place a further burden on the already highly indebted national budget, which could lead to crises that we remember all too well from Greece’s national bankruptcy crisis in 2010.

We see in different industrialized countries that emissions are going down; even in the U.S., the trend since 2005 shows a slight decrease. The EU has a climate goal to be climate neutral by 2050 while the Biden administration at least committed to net zero emissions by mid-century, though Trump revoked that. Will policies like these be enough?

Since we need to return to 350 ppm in a few decades, climate neutrality in 2045 is far too late and far too weak. In addition to achieving a zero-emission economy, we also need a strong carbon-reducing economy, which can be achieved through reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and marine algae farming.

A zero-emission economy with 100 percent renewable energies and an emission-free circular economy is possible — all the technologies are there. All that is needed is the declared political and social will and strong investment from the financial sector and private individuals. Building an emission-free industry would also boost the economy. However, only China is currently pursuing such a strategy aggressively. In the EU and the U.S., fossil fuel interests have regained the upper hand.

You’re often in China. How do you see developments there in terms of climate protection and the energy transition compared to Europe and the U.S.?

A zero-emission economy is based on an energy supply that is 100 percent renewable. If we had that globally, about 60 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions would be stopped. China alone — currently still the largest emitter of greenhouse gases — is on an industrial growth path toward this goal. Sixty-two percent of global photovoltaic growth, 71 percent of global wind energy, and about 60 percent of all batteries and electric vehicles were brought to market in China last year. In 2024, more than 90 percent of the solar cells installed worldwide and 70 percent of electric car batteries were produced in China. Investment in clean energy has been growing for years, while production capacities are being expanded. In 2023, investment increased by 40 percent compared to the previous year.

This is the key driver of China’s economic boom, which has been ongoing for years. Europe, with its half-hearted renewable energy policy, and the U.S. under Trump, with its anti-energy transition agenda, are threatening to go into industrial decline. The industry of the near future will be clean, renewable, and emission-free. Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse.

At the moment, we are seeing a backlash against the green transformation in many societies, especially in the rich industrialized countries. Do you nevertheless see positive developments in the global energy transition?

Yes, renewable energies are advancing massively worldwide. However, this is being driven primarily by China and increasingly also by BRICS countries other than Russia [the BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa]. Those who, like the U.S. and the EU, want to protect their own dirty fossil fuel economy from Chinese dominance with tariffs on solar products or electric cars will only lose market share, as we are already seeing clearly today with the German car manufacturers VW, Daimler, and BMW, which are late to the game and still half-hearted in their commitment to e-mobility.

You say that an energy transition in most countries can be completed within 10 years. Explain how such a rapid transition could take place.

Until around 2012, we had in Germany about 30 percent annual growth in solar energy, and until 2017, similar growth in wind energy. Had these growth rates in solar expansion not been halted in 2012 in the wake of the devastating amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) by Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, and then in wind energy from 2017 onwards by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Germany could have achieved a full supply of 100 percent green electricity by around 2022 with the corresponding parallel expansion of storage facilities. The increases in natural gas prices as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine would have had little impact on our economy, energy security would have been very high, the average 81 billion euros in import costs for fossil fuels would have fallen dramatically, and emissions would have been significantly lower.

Today, we must build on the success story of the EEG from 2000 with its basic principles of fixed feed-in tariffs, whereby a modern EEG should also be geared toward system integration into the electricity grid. Then, with the simultaneous expansion of electric heating, e-vehicles, and industrial production, a full supply of 100 percent green electricity can be achieved by 2030. Such a market ramp-up would also give the domestic renewable energy industry a chance and reduce dependence on China.

If a rapid transition is possible and even economically advantageous, why is it not being implemented politically? Who is continuing to put the brakes on this?

The fossil fuel and nuclear industries have a firm grip on large parts of the media, both traditional and social, and thus also on the political debate. Fake news is constantly being produced, e.g., that renewable energies are driving up electricity prices or that there is a nuclear renaissance in the world. Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder recently claimed that Germany could support its economy by quickly building small nuclear power plants like those already in operation in Canada. A glance at Canada shows that there are no such small nuclear reactors there, not even under construction. There are only two in the planning stage, and their completion is still up in the air. So even a high-ranking politician can lie to the public with impunity.

In the broader debate, climate protection is often portrayed as a burden. In your opinion, what is wrong with the way the energy, transport, and agricultural transitions to protect the environment are discussed in the media?

From the outset, the fossil fuel industry has managed to defame climate protection as a burden on the economy. However, this only applies to the fossil fuel industry, which will of course have to completely cease its business activities involving oil, gas, and coal. But climate protection is a booster for the clean, emission-free economy, as China is now making abundantly clear.

But even many climate activists have adopted the fossil fuel industry’s framing and talked about burden-sharing in climate protection. Spending on renewable energies is not a cost burden, but rather an investment that creates jobs and tax revenue while reducing the costs of damage to health care due to poor air quality or environmental and climate damage. Climate protection is therefore not a burden, but an improvement in prosperity for everyone, except for businesses in the fossil fuel-polluting economy.

In recent years, environmental movements and climate activists have developed various strategies to promote more climate protection in countries. At the moment, it has become difficult to put the issue on the agenda. The pandemic, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the rise of right-wing authoritarian parties have dominated the headlines. In your opinion, what strategies make sense to get governments to take climate action?

Climate activists must finally free themselves from the narratives of fossil fuel industry representatives and demonstrate that climate protection is an essential contribution to the economy, creates new jobs and industries, reduces the costs of disease and environmental damage, relieves private households of high energy costs, and ultimately slows down the galloping national debt. Furthermore, the lack of climate protection is one of the causes of the major problems that are weighing so heavily on us: increasing refugee movements, famines as a result of crop failures, wars over oil or natural gas, fossil fuels as a means of political blackmail, and much more.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2245399115-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 20:58:10.251235

And, in familiar tones, the Trump administration has been quick to demonize all four.
The administration wants to control the Good investigation even as Minnesota officials say the federal government is impeding a state investigation.
On the two arenas of the past week, Trump and his cabal are promising more.
I remember driving overnight from Los Angeles to San Francisco to march with 250,000 others across the city that same day.","“Truly terrifying.” That was how National Nurses United executive director Puneet Maharaj described this week in a group text exchange in the aftermath of the brazen murder of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis on January 7. A day later there was another shooting, some 1,700 miles away in Portland, Oregon, of Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras by border patrol agents. And just a week after Keith Porter was shot and killed while celebrating on New Year’s Eve by an off-duty ICE agent in Northridge, California, a Los Angeles suburb.

All three acts of violence capped a year in which the draconian anti-immigrant drive launched by President Donald Trump and campaign architect Stephen Miller has terrorized immigrant communities and sparked protests across the nation. A year in which at least 32 people have also died in ICE custody, the agency’s most deadly year in decades, according to the Detention Watch Network. Some were long-time residents, some recent abductees in ICE raids. “They died of seizure and heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, tuberculosis or suicide,” or reported neglect, notes the Guardian.

The shootings reflect the broad portrait of US residents–Good, a white, 37-year old mother of three; Porter, a Black 43-year-old father of two; Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras, Venezuelan. And, in familiar tones, the Trump administration has been quick to demonize all four.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem rushed to defend shooter Ross insisting it was an “act of domestic terrorism” by Good. Vice President JD Vance called Ross a “deranged leftist.” Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras were immediately labeled as affiliated with the Tren De Aragua gang, though Portland officials voiced distrust in ICE characterizations. A DHS spokesperson claimed Porter was an “active shooter” and the off-duty agent was “protecting his community,” contentions that infuriated Porter’s friends.

It was a solemn beginning to the new year, an exclamation point on the past 12 months.

The administration wants to control the Good investigation even as Minnesota officials say the federal government is impeding a state investigation. Vance claims agent Ross has “absolute immunity,” a point refuted by Harvard legal scholar Lawrence Tribe on MSNow with Lawrence O’Donnell. “State laws of assault continue to apply, even to a federal officer,” he noted. Outraged Minnesotans are calling for state prosecution as was done, with a conviction, for the police officer who killed George Floyd a short distance from where Good was murdered. Gov. Tim Walz says he wants the state to do a “full investigation.”

Porter’s friends are pushing for justice for Porter. Los Angeles County is “reviewing Porter’s killing,” though, the Los Angeles Times adds, “it sometimes takes years for the agency to determine if a deadly use of force constitutes a crime.” While Los Angeles is a “sanctuary city,” the LA Police Department is notorious for supporting and defending ICE and other federal immigration agents and constraining community protesters instead.

Venezuela, of course, was the other high-profile calamity of the week. Trump’s January 3 military invasion of Venezuela, kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Up to 100 people, including civilians were killed, Venezuelan officials report. The US also bombed a medical warehouse, science labs, and an apartment complex, along with other sites in Caracas.

The long-planned assault followed months of extrajudicial bombings of boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific that have executed at least 115 people since September—like the invasion, in violation of international and US law, and without congressional authorization.

It was a solemn beginning to the new year, an exclamation point on the past 12 months. The Trump administration has carried out the most sustained assault on constitutional norms, dispatching of troops to threaten Americans in numerous cities, weaponization of the Justice Department and programs to punish political enemies and entire Democratic-run states, shredding of decades of healthcare standards that have saved millions of lives, and so much more.

It’s hard to even get more appalled. But the convergence of the emergence of a new American colonial empire abroad with the deadly escalation of Trump’s cruel, racist anti-immigrant program, is what made the week “truly terrifying.”

Many people on social media searched for analogs in recent US history. For this aging lefty who lived through and participated in frequent protests against the Vietnam war, President Ronald Reagan’s sponsoring of military coups and mercenary armies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, I dredged up one comparison.

On April 28, 1970, President Richard Nixon invaded Cambodia with combat troops, an enormous widening of the Southeast Asia war he had pledged to end. A week later on May 4, following days of protests, the Ohio National Guard fired 67 rounds in 13 seconds at student protesters at Kent State University in Ohio, killing four students and wounding nine more. I huddled around the radio listening to the accounts on Pacifica’s KPFA-FM with three roommates, thinking the world had dramatically changed in our lives. Then I rushed off to join a raucous protest at Sonoma State University where I was enrolled.

Trump’s stranglehold on Republican members of Congress is weakening.

Many parallels to that time with this moment exist. There had been years of rallies and marches protesting Nixon and President Lyndon Johnson’s war before him. Nixon was elected promising a secret plan to conclude the long Vietnam War while covertly sabotaging a long-delayed Johnson plan to initiate new peace talks. Trump campaigned as a “peace” advocate, pledging to end “forever wars,” and begging for a Nobel Peace Prize before launching the most unchecked expansion of US colonialism in more than a century.

The arrogant Nixon was, arguably, the most lawless president in US history to that point, before being finally forced to resign. Trump has proven to be far worse, engaging in monarchical dictates and policies, running roughshod over Congress, defying the courts, staging an insurrection at the US Capitol attempting to overturn the 2020 election, and now scheming how to subvert the 2026 and 2028 elections.

On the two arenas of the past week, Trump and his cabal are promising more. Trump has openly threatened to expand military operations to Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Greenland. “I don’t need international law,” Trump told the New York Times. He will only be constrained, he said, by his “own morality.”

Vance has intensified his increasingly desperate rhetoric to defend the murder of Good; the administration recognizes they have lost public support, as millions have viewed the damning video evidence. Going on the attack, as Trump always requires when challenged, Vance boasts the administration has doubled its Gestapo-style police force to over 22,000, and plans to send ICE agents “door to door,” in coming months, mimicking the odious practices of past dictatorships. Trump has also threatened, again, to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to American cities to combat protesters.

Both Nixon and Trump met massive opposition. Anti-Vietnam War marches mushroomed, with over half a million people joining a November 1969 march on Washington. I remember driving overnight from Los Angeles to San Francisco to march with 250,000 others across the city that same day. The repeated mobilizations, augmenting battlefield defeats in Vietnam, ultimately coerced the US to end its war.

Trump has faced similar growing resistance. Up to 8 million Americans joined “No Kings” rallies and marches in June and October last year. And in the two days since the Minneapolis murder, thousands have turned out in spontaneous protests in many cities and smaller communities including Asheville, North Carolina, Boston, Buffalo, Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colorado Springs. Colorado, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Dayton, Ohio, Denver, Durham, North Carolina, Los Angeles, Merrimack, New Hampshire, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Providence, Rhode Island, Seattle, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and repeatedly in Minneapolis.

Trump’s stranglehold on Republican members of Congress is weakening. Trump lost two significant votes in Congress on January 7. Overriding House GOP leaders, 17 Republicans joined Democrats in the House to pass legislation to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years as millions of Americans are facing calamitous increases in healthcare coverage due to GOP obstruction in the fall.

In the Senate, five Republicans joined in a “rare bipartisan rebuke of the White House” to set up a War Powers Resolution vote to require congressional approval for Trump’s militarism in Venezuela and elsewhere. Incensed by the defiance, Trump called for the defeat of the five Republicans. Both actions face a difficult outcome, but the votes are significant. It shows Republicans are worried about the approaching midterm elections in November, following sweeping losses last year.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62687945&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2026-01-11 06:57:47.783525

Broad, www.nytimes.com, william-j-broad",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/science/trump-science-budget-cuts-congress.html,"Congress is racing to undo thousands of cuts to federal science programs that President Trump called for last year when planning the government’s current budget.
This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee released a bipartisan package of bills that largely scraps Mr. Trump’s planned cuts.
“That’s pretty solid,” said Alessandra Zimmermann, a budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a scientific group based in Washington.
The Senate package countered with a reduction to $8.75 billion, or less than 1 percent.
On Thursday, the House voted to approve the Senate package.","Congress is racing to undo thousands of cuts to federal science programs that President Trump called for last year when planning the government’s current budget.

If enacted, the president’s bid for an overall cut in scientific funding to $154 billion from $198 billion — a plunge of 22 percent — would have been the largest reduction in federal spending on science since World War II, when Washington and the seekers of nature’s secrets began their partnership.

This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee released a bipartisan package of bills that largely scraps Mr. Trump’s planned cuts. Analysts say that, if the proposed budgets hold up in the weeks ahead, Congress will set aside roughly $188 billion for federal research — a drop of about 4 percent from the most recent annual budget.

“That’s pretty solid,” said Alessandra Zimmermann, a budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a scientific group based in Washington. “Congress is really starting to push back.”

Surprisingly, analysts foresee a possible rise of more than 2 percent in the budget category known as basic research — the blue-sky variety that produces fundamental strides and spinoffs in fields such as health care and artificial intelligence. Last year, the Trump administration called for a cut in federal basic research of more than one-third.

Mr. Trump sought even larger cuts for the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the nation’s basic research. He proposed that its budget be slashed to $3.9 billion from $8.8 billion, a drop of 56 percent. The Senate package countered with a reduction to $8.75 billion, or less than 1 percent.

The bipartisan accord on funding science, Ms. Zimmermann said, stands in sharp contrast with the congressional impasse that shut down the government last fall as Democrats and Republicans clashed over the renewal of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act.

“They’re working together now,” she said. “It’s a return to normalcy.” The new cooperation, Ms. Zimmermann added, is “promising for the eventual passage of the bills.”

Each year, the president submits a budget request to Congress in advance of the annual appropriations process. Only Congress has the power of the purse.

In a statement, Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, praised the package of bills as good not only for investigating nature but also for enhancing public safety and the welfare of American families.

“Democrats fought to protect investments that matter,” she said. The package, she added, “rejects President Trump’s push to let our competitors do laps around us.”

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, called the package “a fiscally responsible” move that will “spur scientific research necessary to maintain U.S. competitiveness.”

The Senate package includes $24.4 billion for NASA (a 1.6 percent cut), $8.8 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (a 4 percent cut), $8.4 billion for the Department of Energy Office of Science (a 1.9 percent increase), $6.2 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (roughly flat), $1.4 billion for the U.S. Geological Survey (a 2 percent cut) and $1.2 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (a 2.3 percent increase).

On Thursday, the House voted to approve the Senate package. Many federal programs have recently had their budgets frozen at last year’s levels. Congress, eager to avoid another shutdown, is working to pass spending bills before stopgap measures expire on Jan. 30.

So far, the House’s moves on this year’s science budgeting add up to an estimated total of $185 billion — close to the Senate figure of $188 billion, and putting the two chambers not far apart for negotiations on a final budget.

The improved budgetary picture cannot undo the damage that the Trump administration’s frenzy of budget cutting and administrative chaos brought to the nation’s scientific establishment, analysts say. They see the cycles of cuts and reinstatements as taking a toll that in some cases may require years to mend.

Analysts also note that the administration has made policy shifts on how appropriated funds are spent. For instance, the National Institutes of Health, which traditionally hedged its scientific bets by supporting a wide range of investigators, is now dividing its annual budget into fewer projects.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10hs-science-budget-wmjp/10hs-science-budget-wmjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 20:58:15.244993

Infrastructure is the foundation, Intelligence is the future. We design integrated, circular, and impactful strategies.”

— Harvey Blom, Managing Partner

DE, UNITED STATES, January 10, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — GRN Energy today announced its evolution into GRN Bi (GRN Business Intelligence), marking a strategic transition from infrastructure delivery toward intelligence-driven platforms, SaaS solutions, and AI-enabled decision-support systems for digital and infrastructure economies.

This transformation represents an evolution, not a break.

Over recent years, GRN Energy has developed deep expertise at the intersection of energy, digital infrastructure, and compute. As data centers increasingly evolve into AI-driven, grid-interactive systems, value creation now depends less on physical assets alone and more on real-time intelligence, orchestration, and decision-making.

GRN Bi positions itself as the intelligence layer.

*Infrastructure is the foundation. Intelligence is the future.*

About the Rebrand

GRN Energy is evolving into GRN Bi (GRN Business Intelligence) to reflect a strategic focus on:

* Business Intelligence & Analytics

* SaaS platforms and orchestration tools

* AI-driven decision-support systems

* Strategic advisory for digital and infrastructure economies

The company’s team, expertise, and global partner network remain unchanged. What has evolved is how GRN delivers value — translating energy, infrastructure, and compute into actionable intelligence, operational resilience, and long-term impact for enterprises, governments, investors, and infrastructure operators.

GRN Bi operates as a Business Intelligence and Digital Strategy company, enabling C-level decision-making across energy-powered digital ecosystems. The company’s website is currently being updated to reflect this next phase.

Strategic Partnership with Bentaus

As part of this evolution, GRN Bi (formerly GRN Energy) has entered into an official strategic partnership with Bentaus, supporting the global expansion of Bentaus’ business development and brand positioning.

This partnership strengthens GRN Bi’s role as a bridge between infrastructure and intelligence, while expanding Bentaus’ reach across data center operators, AI infrastructure developers, and energy-integrated digital ecosystems worldwide.

At the center of the collaboration is Bentaus’ Power Asset Orchestrator (PAO) — a next-generation orchestration platform designed for AI factories and energy-aware data centers.

PAO unifies power, compute, thermal, carbon, and grid intelligence into a single real-time control plane. Built on a zero-trust, event-driven architecture, PAO ingests telemetry from critical assets — including CDUs, PDUs, busbars, GPUs, inverters, and live grid signals — and converts it into deterministic, verifiable actions.

From soft-start GPU ramping and predictive thermal modeling to demand-response participation, PAO enables AI infrastructure to operate as an intelligent, flexible, and grid-aware system.

Functioning as the air-traffic controller of the AI factory, Bentaus PAO ensures reliability, efficiency, and resilience at scale. As data centers evolve into flexible grid assets and GPU flywheels, PAO delivers the intelligence required to support the next decade of AI infrastructure.

Industry Engagement: Powering AI Factories

In alignment with this partnership, GRN Bi is supporting the upcoming webinar:

“Powering AI Factories” By Michael Schulman, Robert Davidoff, and Kevin Culp

The session explores how unified compute and energy orchestration addresses the growing complexity of GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and HPC workloads, enabling visibility, optimization, and sustainability.

By integrating Supermicro’s Supercloud Composer (SCC) with Bentaus’ Power Asset Orchestrator (PAO), operators gain end-to-end infrastructure visibility, optimized GPU utilization, alignment with real-time grid pricing, and scalable AI factory operations.

This silicon anode upgrade addresses two things EV drivers care about most: range and charging speed.","Electric vehicles are getting closer to overcoming some of their biggest challenges — and a new battery breakthrough could play a major role in making EVs more practical and appealing for drivers.

Porsche-backed Group14 Technologies and New York-based Sionic Energy recently announced a major breakthrough in lithium-ion battery technology that could significantly improve EV performance. The innovation replaces traditional graphite anodes — a key battery component that helps store and move energy — with high-energy silicon-carbon materials. These new anodes deliver stable performance even at elevated temperatures while overcoming other long-standing problems, such as thermal instability and volume expansion, that have historically hindered the use of silicon in batteries.

""I've spent years watching the industry chase silicon's promise and hit the walls of complexity, cost, development time, and narrow performance,"" Ed Williams, president and CEO of Sionic Energy, said in a news release. ""That's why I'm proud to share this Sionic benchmark and the Group14 partnership that breaks through those walls and accelerates silicon's broad market adoption.""

""The anode is essentially responsible for how much energy a cell can hold and how quickly it can charge,"" Inside EVs reported. According to the companies, the silicon-carbon anodes allow batteries to store more energy — up to 55% more — and have a longer lifespan, plus benefit from extreme fast charging — potentially under 10 minutes.

Inside EVs noted silicon anode tech is already being used in high-performing smartphones, showing its potential, albeit on a smaller scale.

Graphite has long been the go-to for anodes because of its stability and energy density, but it comes with downsides. Mining and processing graphite is highly polluting and expensive, and much of the global supply is sourced from China, creating both environmental and geopolitical concerns.

The anode also makes up the largest share of a battery's volume and weight, according to the European Carbon and Graphite Association. By replacing heavier graphite with much lighter silicon, battery makers could reduce battery size and vehicle weight without sacrificing range or performance.

Another notable advantage is immediate scalability. The new technology is designed to work with existing battery manufacturing lines, allowing it to be adopted more quickly instead of requiring costly factory overhauls. This silicon anode upgrade addresses two things EV drivers care about most: range and charging speed. These key improvements could make EVs more appealing and accessible by lowering costs, as silicon-carbon materials are much cheaper and more abundant than graphite.

These silicon-carbon batteries also make better use of electricity, supporting the big goal to reduce planet-warming pollution. That impact can be amplified when drivers charge at home using renewable energy, such as home solar.

And every year we remind you, and them, of the things they need to do. There’s frequently some overlap, but unfortunately a lot of what needs doing to make our state the best place it can be for us today and for our children and grandchildren in the years to come doesn’t make lawmakers’ to-do list. Here are the five things our state needs most from the Legislature this year:

Educate every child

Legislative leaders understand that the key to South Carolina’s prosperity is providing all kids with a decent education, which creates a ready workforce that attracts businesses to our state. That understanding is paying off: We have fewer teacher vacancies, more kids are attending preschool, and test scores are on the rise. If we were, say, Minnesota, we’d be ready to rest on our laurels. But we’re South Carolina, which was way behind in educating our children, so we have to do more of the same — and other things as well.

We still have teacher vacancies, despite impressive pay increases and legislative shows of respect for teachers, because we’re still in the midst of a national teacher shortage; and once we reach Gov. Henry McMaster’s goal of paying first-year teachers $50,000 — which lawmakers should achieve this year — we’ll need to reset the goal, because inflation is eating up pay, and other states are raising it as well.

Meantime, more parents are enrolling their children in public charter schools, which would be fine if charter schools did as well here as they do in the rest of the country. Some do, but on the whole they don't, in no small part because of a loophole that lets them escape accountability. This must be the year lawmakers close that loophole. And don’t even get us started on the Legislature’s foolish decision to throw our tax dollars at private schools without demanding any accountability from them.

Pay for our needs

Back when Mark Sanford was governor, he tried to cap state spending increases to inflation plus population growth. Clearly, it wasn’t needed. Lawmakers slashed spending during the last big recession, and since then they’ve ignored the cost of rising prices and an exploding population, instead competing nearly every year to see who could cut taxes more. Little wonder our roads are crumbling, the wait for criminal and civil trials is interminable, we can’t afford to keep guards in our prisons or our Highway Patrol fully staffed; we can’t even afford to keep dangerously unstable people in prison or treatment, and on and on.

Yet legislative leaders are determined this year to eliminate the state income tax, which funds about 40 percent of state government. Some want to eliminate local property taxes instead — or in addition. There’s plenty of room to make our tax system smarter, with some taxes higher and others lower — although the plan House Republicans backed last year, to raise most people’s income taxes in order to slash it for some, would not have been smarter. South Carolina isn’t a high-tax state. We can’t afford to keep neglecting essential services so politicians can keep congratulating themselves for cutting taxes more.

Meantime, those tax-cutting House members and some senators will be fighting to lift the moratorium on budget earmarks. Whether there’s an appropriate place in the budget for earmarks or not, there’s no place for the secret and unvetted earmarks that have been the rule rather than the exception in our state.

Protect environment, public

Threats to South Carolina’s natural environment have taken a lot of forms over the years, but rarely have so many threats come in such a neat package as AI data centers. Their voracious electricity appetite is pushing utilities to take shortcuts on building new capacity, which can threaten our air and water while driving up everybody’s power bills. The centers' appetite for our water further threatens our groundwater, rivers and lakes. And their massive footprints mean they can wipe out large swaths of environmentally sensitive land, as one threatens to do near Walterboro.

When the Senate tried last year to prohibit state government from paying data centers to locate to our state — a modest effort to limit their damage — the House said absolutely no, and the Senate caved. But there’s too much at stake to let the House’s position stand. We now know that enticing data centers isn’t essential to power companies’ bottom line, so lawmakers should require Dominion and Duke to follow the lead of Santee Cooper and make data centers cover the entire cost of building new capacity for them. They also should require data centers to significantly reduce the amount of water they use to cool their computers, as some new centers are doing, and impose statewide restrictions on where the centers can locate.

Santee Cooper’s deal to sell the abandoned, unfinished nuclear reactors at V.C. Summer to Brookfield Asset Management could tie into this debate, as Brookfield is expected to sell the electricity to data centers or other large users. That almost certainly will require lawmakers to loosen South Carolina’s utility regulatory framework. If lawmakers don't pay attention to ratepayers' interests, that could be just as expensive to South Carolinians as the data centers buying their power from regulated utilities.

Make government honest

Protecting judicial independence, reducing politicians’ ability to profit from their offices at the expense of the public and just generally doing government honestly and publicly all fall into the catch-all “good government,” which is more about how government operates than what it does. We need a good bit of action on this front.

How we select judges will be back on the table, not because more legislators recognize what a bad idea it is for the Legislature to have near total say over the third branch of government but because they’re afraid to buck a deep-pocketed special interest who hasn’t gotten the rulings he wanted from judges. Still, the fact is that the governor needs a much larger role than he has. If anyone needs proof, lawmakers are threatening to provide it by unseating a justice who voted to take away their unconstitutional pay raises; there’s even some talk of reducing the court’s funding.

Perhaps we won’t need any more transparency about how lawyer-legislators attempt to intimidate judges if the whole Legislature acts openly to do that. But we do need more transparency in the rest of government. State law requires governments to provide most records to citizens who ask for them, and hold most debates in public. But from the smallest town council to the largest state agency, the laws are routinely violated, because officials know they’ll get away with it unless someone sues them, and they know even when they lose the lawsuit, there’s practically no punishment. The Legislature needs to change the math here, with real punishment for governments that violate the Freedom of Information Act and a state agency whose job it is to prosecute or sue violators, like police and prosecutors enforce other laws, so members of the public don’t have to do it themselves.

And there’s still the matter of those multibillion-dollar accounting messes created by the state treasurer, comptroller general and auditor, and their refusal to tell the Legislature about them. Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom and Auditor George Kennedy resigned for their roles in massive financial mishaps that also involved Treasurer Curtis Loftis. Mr. Loftis needs to be removed as well, we need a law to protect the auditor from bullying by the comptroller and treasurer, and voters should be given the option of making treasurer and comptroller appointed positions.

Provide local oversight

For years we’ve argued that the governor needs more control over the executive branch of government, and lawmakers are slowly making progress on that, but that doesn’t reduce the need for the Legislature to provide oversight of the governor’s agencies; if anything, the need increases each time the Legislature turns over more authority.

The same is true with local government: Counties and municipalities need to have more say over how they run their communities. But as we’ve seen from the growing number of local governments that face financial collapse from incompetence and corruption, they need help and sometimes oversight to ensure they’re being responsible financial stewards and obeying basic laws on ethics, transparency and money management.

The Ethics Commission could handle ethics violations if the Legislature would apply the State Ethics Act to local government, and that new FOI-enforcement agency could take care of that if lawmakers would create it. On top of all that, lawmakers should remove restrictions on how much money local elected officials collect and how they do it, and what sort of ordinances they adopt, while also creating an agency inspired by North Carolina’s Local Government Commission, which oversees local bond issues and required annual audits, monitors financial health and offers broad assistance in financial administration to local governments.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/ff/0fff2070-68a9-446c-b6f1-9a2304c99c77/695d38c48dedf.image.jpg?crop=1858%2C976%2C0%2C54&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-10 17:59:16.855353

Here are some key strategies and technologies that have been discussed on Reddit to address various forms of urban pollution:

Air Pollution

Industrial Air Capture: Companies like Climeworks are working on direct CO2 removal, though it is capital-intensive. ""Industrial air capture (direct co2 removal) — companies like climeworks, but capital intensive""

Pollution Sensors and Real-Time Monitoring: This approach is less capital-intensive and can provide immediate insights into pollution levels. ""Pollution sensors + real-time monitoring for factories/cities — more sass than hardware, faster to market""

Planting Trees: A simple yet effective solution to improve air quality by absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen. ""We already have such air purifiers. They are called ‘Trees’. We just need to plant more trees and take care of the existing ones.""

Electric Vehicles (EVs): Replacing combustion engine vehicles with EVs can significantly reduce exhaust emissions. ""That plus china seems to be a world leader in terms of electric vehicles. There’s a lot to he said about the production process etc, but in the end these cars just don’t vomit exhaust gases into the air when and where people drive them.""

Waste Management

Underground Waste Systems: Systems like Sweden's Envac use underground piping to transport waste, reducing visible street litter and odors. ""Buildings and city blocks dispose of waste into sealed inlets. The waste is sucked through pipes to central locations outside the urban area.""

Peer-to-Peer Recycling: Connecting waste producers directly to recycling plants can reduce logistics waste. ""One idea I’m exploring is a subscription model connecting waste producers directly to recycling plants — cutting logistics waste and making the system cleaner overall.""

Composting: Reducing the amount of trash by composting organic material. ""I found during last spring and summer that composting significantly reduced the amount of trash that I put in my trash can.""

Water Management

Porous Pavement: This new pavement can absorb rainwater, help prevent urban flooding, and filter out pollutants. ""This new pavement, developed by AquiPor Technologies in Washington State, can absorb rainwater and help prevent urban flooding.""

Water Storage and Filtration: Investing in solutions like water bladders and filtration systems can help in emergency situations. ""If you have a bathtub I would invest in a Water Bob. Solved the issue of water supply in an emergency without taking up space.""

Noise Pollution

Enforcement of Noise Ordinances: More strict enforcement of existing noise ordinances can reduce noise from modified vehicle exhausts. ""Where I live 90% of road noise pollution is from cars, trucks and motorcycles with modified exhaust systems.""

Narrower Streets and Lower Speeds: Reducing vehicle speed and optimizing street design can significantly cut down on traffic noise. ""Narrower streets, lower speeds. That gets rid of most traffic noise.""

Soundproofing: Implementing better soundproofing standards in urban areas can help mitigate noise pollution. ""Better soundproofing standards deals with everything else.""

Urban Planning and Infrastructure

Green Roofs: While controversial, green roofs can be practical in certain contexts, especially when designed to manage water. ""Yes, if you are trying to solve a problem beyond having something green on your roof, they can be a sustainable option.""

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gm-car-ev-suv.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-10 17:59:07.955139

Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.
Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing affordability crisis. While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

OpenAI and SoftBank will each invest $500 million in SB Energy to support the energy firm’s growth as a data center developer and operator, the companies said in a statement Friday. OpenAI also said it has selected SB Energy to build and operate its 1.2 gigawatt data center in Milam County, Texas. A single gigawatt is enough to power roughly 750,000 US homes at any given moment.

The companies did not disclose a valuation for the investment.

For large tech firms, securing power is key in their quest to satisfy lofty AI ambitions. That’s created a race for energy to support more and larger data centers — and is helping drive up electricity demand.

The need for power is leading some to invest in suppliers or plants, or line up their own energy sources. Meta Platforms Inc. on Friday said it has agreed to deals that could ultimately total more than 6 gigawatts of nuclear power.

SB Energy, which has long been backed by SoftBank, was founded as a renewable and storage developer, but has in recent years expanded into developing, owning and operating data centers. The new funding follows SB Energy lining up $800 million last year from Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds.

The tie-up with SoftBank and OpenAI adds to a growing web of interconnected deals between tech companies that are helping to prop up the AI sector and raising concerns about the possible fallout if demand for artificial intelligence falls short of expectations. SoftBank is one of OpenAI’s largest investors.

The SB Energy partnership builds on OpenAI’s Stargate initiative, a joint project between the AI startup and partners including SoftBank and Oracle Corp with the goal of spending $500 billion on data centers and infrastructure for AI in the US over four years. The project’s first site is a massive data center in Abilene, Texas, developed by Oracle and built alongside development partner Crusoe.

Ed Case, a Democrat representing Hawai‘i House District 1 in Washington, voted to approve final House passage of a measure consolidating three more of 12 annual appropriations bills, which would commence Oct. 1.

The measure, which passed the House, included a hefty list of requests by Case — member of the key House Committee on Appropriations, which is responsible for all federal discretionary funding — for hundreds of millions of dollars for federal programs directly benefiting Hawai‘i.

It includes $39 billion to fund U.S. Department of the Interior; $63 billion for U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works programs and various energy programs; and $81 billion for commerce, justice, science and related programs.

The interior, environment and related appropriations bill included in the measure funds U.S. Department of the Interior, including National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service and various independent agencies such as National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities.

Several of Case’s priority requests were approved in the measure, including:

$4.75 million for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s State of the Birds Activities to respond to the urgent needs of critically endangered birds that now face possible extinction. These funds are helping to save numerous endemic birds in Hawai‘i that have been devastated by climate change and avian malaria.

$45.5 million for U.S. Geological Survey Biological Threats and Invasive Species Research Program.

$64 million for U.S. Geological Survey’s Climate Adaptation Science Centers, which includes the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center based at University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. These centers provide regionally relevant scientific information, tools and techniques to resource managers and communities in Hawai‘i in response to our changing climate.

$76 million for state fire assistance, which provides financial and technical support directly to states to enhance firefighting capacity, support community-based hazard mitigation and expand outreach and education to homeowners and communities concerning fire prevention.

House

FUNDING VARIOUS AGENCIES: The House has passed the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act (H.R. 6938), sponsored by Tom Cole, R-Okla. The bill would provide $215 billion of fiscal 2026 funding for many federal agencies, including the Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Justice departments. Cole said it reduced wasteful spending, maintained environmental and energy standards, and supported law enforcement and the effort against fentanyl. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 397 yeas to 28 nays.

YEAS: Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-3rd

FLORIDA INDIAN RESERVATION: The House has failed to override the veto by President Donald Trump of the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act (H.R. 504), sponsored by Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez, R-Fla. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee tribal reservation to include land in the Everglades National Park. Gimenez said: “Including this land in the reserved area will empower the tribe to protect their community, manage water flow into the Everglades National Park, and raise structures within the camp to prevent catastrophic flooding.” The vote to override, on Jan. 8, was 236 yeas to 188 nays, with a two-thirds majority required.

YEAS: Perez

COLORADO WATER PIPELINE: The House has failed to override the veto by President Trump of the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act (H.R. 131), sponsored by Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. The bill would have expanded federal subsidies for a water pipeline in southeast Colorado to be built by the Bureau of Reclamation, including by reducing interest payments on a loan to communities that would be served by the pipeline. Boebert said: “Rural communities in southeastern Colorado need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable water they can utilize on a daily basis.” The vote to override, on Jan. 8, was 248 yeas to 177 nays, with 1 voting present, and a two-thirds majority required.

YEAS: Perez

HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES: The House has passed the Breaking the Gridlock Act (H.R. 1834), sponsored by Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Mass. The bill would extend, through 2028, individual health insurance tax credits that were enacted in 2021 and 2022 and expired at the close of 2025. McGovern said: “It is unconscionable that anyone in the richest country in history should not have access to good, quality health care.” An opponent, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., called the bill “subsidizing insurance plans for wealthy people,” given that families making up to $600,000 a year would benefit. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 230 yeas to 196 nays.

YEAS: Perez

Senate

MILITARY HEALTH OFFICIAL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Keith Bass to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Bass was a Navy sailor and officer for two decades, then a medical director at the Central Intelligence Agency, private health care executive, and most recently a hospital administrator at the Veterans Affairs Department. The vote, on Jan. 5, was 50 yeas to 35 nays.

NAYS: Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Patty Murray, D-Wash.

CIA GENERAL COUNSEL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Joshua Simmons to be general counsel at the Central Intelligence Agency. A legal adviser at the State Department since May 2025, Simmons was formerly a private practice lawyer specializing in international litigation. The vote, on Jan. 6, was 53 yeas to 47 nays.

NAYS: Cantwell, Murray

DRUG CONTROL OFFICIAL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Sara Carter Bailey to be the director of national drug control policy, a White House post with responsibility for coordinating anti-drug efforts at 16 different agencies. A former reporter and contributor to Fox News, Carter Bailey also hosted a podcast until last April. An opponent, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said she “lacks any serious qualifications for this role. She is not a physician or addiction specialist. She has never been a prosecutor or law enforcement official.” The vote, on Jan. 6, was 52 yeas to 48 nays.

NAYS: Cantwell, Murray

SOUTH DAKOTA AIR QUALITY: The Senate has rejected a motion to proceed to consideration of a bill (S.J. Res. 86), sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would have voided an Environmental Protection Agency rule issued last August that approved South Dakota’s revision of its plan for implementing the EPA’s rule governing regional haze levels and visibility at national parks such as Mount Rushmore. Whitehouse said the approval was part of a Trump administration effort “to tear down the protections of Americans’ health and safety and our environment.” An opponent, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said: “Overturning EPA’s approval would force the state to adopt unnecessary pollution control measures, despite clear evidence that they would not meaningfully improve visibility.” The vote, on Jan. 7, was 43 yeas to 50 nays.

YEAS: Cantwell, Murray

VENEZUELA: The Senate has agreed to a motion to discharge from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a bill (S.J. Res. 98), sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that would require the ending of U.S. military force against Venezuela in the absence of authorization from Congress. Kaine said congressional oversight of military actions in Venezuela was necessary because of signs “that this will go on for a long period of time. The seizure of oil, the dictation of terms about elections and the politics of Venezuela will go on for years.” A bill opponent, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited various examples of past presidential use of military power overseas without prior authorization in saying President Trump has “constitutional authority” to act in Venezuela. The vote to discharge, on Jan. 8, was 52 yeas to 47 nays.

YEAS: Cantwell, Murray

LOUISIANA JUDGE: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Alexander Van Hook to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Van Hook had been an assistant U.S. attorney in the district since 1999, then was its acting U.S. attorney from January to September 2025. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 53 yeas to 40 nays.

A consortium of U.S. senators - including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.
), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) - is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them.
While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated.
Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans' already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies.","For months, anger has been building in the communities that are involuntarily footing the bill for the AI boom. As data center clusters pop up around the globe to feed AI's massive and growing computational needs, nearby communities are seeing their utility bills skyrocket, even if they themselves don't benefit from the sector at all. And now, in the United States, the backlash against data centers' resource consumption - and its impact on consumers' bottom line - has spilled out of the bounds of local politics and landed in the Senate.

A consortium of U.S. senators - including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) - is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them. In open letters written to seven AI companies, the senators pushed for accountability and transparency, citing a study that found ""electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years"" in ""areas located near significant data center activity.""

While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, ""data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth"" for utilities.

Due to this intense demand growth, major utilities in these states, plus North Carolina, project that they will collectively add 32,600 MW of electrical load over the next 15 years. And it's consumers - of energy, not necessarily of AI - who will have to pay the price for all of that additional demand. It's estimated that Virginians can expect average electricity prices to increase by another 25 percent by 2030.

""We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations-data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,"" Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider earlier this year. ""Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.""

And the terms behind that transfer of responsibility are extremely opaque, as is typical for the AI sector. In the Senators' letter to AI companies, they blast these firms for operating in the shadows against public interest. The letter notes that AI firms ""ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a 'Fortune 100 company' is planning an 'industrial development' seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,"" senators wrote.

Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans' already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies. Data centers require huge amounts of land and considerable water sources, which could lead to conflict and issues of scarcity in certain hotspots such as drier climates and agricultural communities concerned about land competition and ""environmental impacts, noise and lack of transparency.""

In many ways, the country - and the world - simply is not prepared for the scale of the AI boom, and all of the resources and regulations that it will require. There are serious concerns about whether ageing power grids can keep up with demand, and whether energy output can keep up with surging demand. Plus, the way that our systems are designed simply never saw this coming.

As the senators express in their letter, ""the current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying"" in which costs are shared by all grid users, ""was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.""

The views expressed herein are those of the author alone.

The Trump Administration has seemingly adopted the sidelining of science as a core operating principle. Two egregious examples in this week’s news are emblematic of the extent to which this administration actively regards scientific research and evidence as a hindrance to their policies rather than a critical input.

The Washington Post reported that the scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were ignored in the recent overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule. The Post reported that, “That process to alter vaccine recommendations, they [CDC scientists] and several former health officials said, did not include extensive consultation with the agency’s subject matter experts or the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel that is usually done.” In other words, it was a wholly political decision with no regard for the scientific evidence.

It was also reported that, “Trump administration health officials said the revised schedule more closely resembles recommendations in other high-income countries and would build trust with Americans who think their children are getting too many shots…”. Of course, the officials didn’t note that they and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have aggressively worked to persuade Americans that their children are getting too many shots despite the scientific evidence to the contrary. Tautology is not dead, in case you were wondering.

The EPA Jumps on This Week’s Sidelining Bandwagon

Not to be left out, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to do all they can to ignore the science on chemical safety. After all, it is only one of their core responsibilities in protecting the public. ProPublica reports the EPA is considering adopting a position pushed by chemical companies that the agency does not have the authority to place new restrictions on air pollution once an initial decision has been made, regardless of new evidence as to the potential harm and public health effects of the pollutant. Even writing that sentence seems nonsensical to me.

The implication is straightforward. Scientific evidence that could protect people’s health and safety can only be used once like a Kleenex. New evidence should be ignored. The case in point for this particular sidelining action is restrictions on the use of ethylene oxide for sterilizing medical equipment and in other chemical processes. Prior to 2016, this chemical wasn’t considered as a major dangerous pollutant. It should be noted that the facilities that emit ethylene oxide are largely located in black communities or communities of color as is the case with many chemical facilities. New evidence emerged that ethylene oxide was far more dangerous than previously thought and in 2024 greater restrictions were placed on it’s use. Those restrictions were delayed by the Trump Administration already to allow for a slower transition by industry (apparently 10 years was too fast).

The EPA now is considering adopting the position that the restrictions that are on hold rely on new scientific evidence and that they don’t have the authority to use new evidence. Since the industry complied with the previous, weak, standards there is no problem. Except of course for the increased cancer risk for the people exposed to the pollutant.

Sidelining as a Principle

These two cases from two different agencies rely on the same essential approach by this administration. In the Trump Administration science will not be allowed to influence public policy. Danger to the public be damned.

But to meet future demand under Net-Zero will require adding 10 times more Wind/Solar infrastructure than we have today.
Further, we cannot generate enough energy using only “renewables” to replace aging Wind/Solar infrastructure as it wears out.
However, China must be pleased that the US is destroying its own economy by installing Chinese-made Wind/Solar infrastructure.
NYISO warned of big trouble (October NY Draft Energy Plan) because Albany has continued to push Wind/Solar/BESS.","Twenty years after “An Inconvenient Truth,” none of Al Gore’s wild speculations about climate catastrophe have emerged, yet people still cling to the climate nonsense, and New York state energy policy remains absurdly captive to that narrative.

By way of example, climate fraud led New York to require houses built after Jan. 1 to use electric heat, and required the state have 70% “renewable” energy by 2030. The simple fact that these impossible regulations were devised by Albany politicians demonstrates the absolute incompetence of those who run New York.

Reality recently forced Albany to pause these impossible mandates, but we should not expect Albany politicians to stop rewarding their corporate sponsors with continued subsidies for Wind/Solar/BESS installations. The political gravy train still outweighs the good of working people, and still threatens our region.

Seven years ago Albany passed the impossible Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), and still ignores the impending economic disaster it will cause. After spending billions, New York still derives less than 10% of its total electrical energy from Wind/Solar, which costs two to four times as much as conventional power. CLCPA will bankrupt us while never coming close to attaining its impossible Net-Zero mandates, and here is why…

Wind and Solar require 100% backup; hence we must pay to build redundant generation infrastructure using fossil fuels. But why should we waste resources building Wind/Solar infrastructure in addition to backup generation infrastructure when Natural Gas alone will do the job? It’s economic malpractice.

Worse: If Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are used for backup, then at least 4 days of energy storage will be required to cover lapses in Wind/Solar generation. But to meet future demand under Net-Zero will require adding 10 times more Wind/Solar infrastructure than we have today. Hence, under CLCPA, we will need 40 times more Wind/Solar/BESS infrastructure than we currently have (we are being generous). Where will we put all that stuff? At what cost?

It gets worse: All BESS must be replaced every 10 to 15 years at an estimated cost of about $3.6 trillion for New York state alone ($200,000 per person), and Wind/Solar infrastructure must be replaced every 15-20 years at massive cost. How will we pay for that? Where will we put all the non-recyclable junk?

Further, we cannot generate enough energy using only “renewables” to replace aging Wind/Solar infrastructure as it wears out. This is why Dems won’t pass NY Senate Bill 2023-S6732. Renewables are absolutely not sustainable as was claimed.

To transmit enough electricity for EVs, school buses, home heating, computing, etc., and to balance the Grid using Wind/Solar sources, we must massively increase the carrying capacity and extent of the Distribution and Transmission Systems. Where will all that copper come from?

However, China must be pleased that the US is destroying its own economy by installing Chinese-made Wind/Solar infrastructure. China also holds major stakes in American Wind/Solar companies that soak-up US subsidies – stealing from taxpayers to make China rich. The high cost of “renewables” using Chinese-made infrastructure keeps US industry uncompetitive.

Meanwhile, gas turbine manufacturers are doubling production to meet increasing world-wide demand for Natural Gas power generation, while Hitachi and others are cutting production of Wind Turbines because of their high cost and low effectiveness. The world (except Albany) is rejecting Net-Zero nonsense.

Worldwide more than 100 new designs are being developed for Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs), with some (China and Russia) already in commercial production. Thirty-five of these new designs are being developed in the US, but we are significantly behind because we have utterly wasted our human and financial resources subsidizing Wind/Solar/BESS for the past 20-plus years.

Japan is now restarting the Fukushima nuclear plant that was shutdown after a tsunami 15 years ago, while Michigan is restarting the Palisades nuclear plant that they previously shut down in a fit of Green stupidity.

In the push for renewables, Albany prematurely killed the Indian Point nuclear plant, which produced over 2.1 GW of reliable clean power 24/7/365, costing NY residents billions of dollars. Indian Point can’t be brought back, but Gov. Kathy Hochul wants us to thank her for finally cracking the door open for nuclear power. Yet she offers no mea-culpa for having wasted billions of NYS taxpayer money killing Indian Point, even after she was warned what would happen when she did so.

NYISO warned of big trouble (October NY Draft Energy Plan) because Albany has continued to push Wind/Solar/BESS. In addition, NYSERDA’s latest report openly states the impossibility of Net Zero under current law (CLCPA). Yet Albany keeps throwing money at Wind/Solar/BESS while Hochul plays politics.

A recent report showed that electricity cost in the state is now 58% higher than the national average. Is it any wonder that our businesses and people pack up and leave?

It’s time to push the Reset Button and repeal CLCPA, and remove all its supporters from Albany for malpractice.

The strategy will set out £15bn worth of measures designed to encourage people to switch to greener energy sources, and, according to the Labour government, will help lift over one million households out of fuel poverty by 2023.

As part of the plan, Ed Miliband's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) is considering around £2bn worth of loans, interest-free, for households to use to install solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, PoliticsHome understands. These loans would be spread over five to ten years, under one option being discussed.

The government has already confirmed ahead of the Warm Homes Plan that councils and social housing providers will be given up to £1.8bn to decarbonise social housing.

Ministers are also expected to keep long-term subsidies for heat pumps at their existing levels. The government currently offers households £7,500 grants towards heat pumps, with the aim of persuading millions of people to replace gas boilers with the greener, electric alternative.

The government told PoliticsHome it does not comment on leaks.

A DESNZ spokesperson added: “We are investing an additional £1.5bn into our Warm Homes Plan, taking it to nearly £15bn – the biggest ever public investment to upgrade homes and tackle fuel poverty ever.

""We are doubling down on support for home upgrades and will set out our plans to help households, and support thousands more clean energy jobs, soon.”

PoliticsHome understands there is a desire in government to move ahead with the Warm Homes Plan as quickly as possible, with the Prime Minister making tackling the cost-of-living key to his 2026 agenda and rebuilding Labour Party support.

Starmer this week told cabinet ministers to ""keep a relentless focus on the cost of living"" and argued that revivals by centre-left political parties elsewhere in the world have been sparked by driving down costs facing voters.

Ofgem recently confirmed that the energy price cap, which sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge households, would rise by 0.2 per cent from 1 January, meaning that the average household will pay £1,758 a year.

The heat pumps element of the government's green energy strategy risks controversy. The Times recently reported concern among some Labour MPs that a move to impose levies on gas boilers to subsidise heat pumps would disproportionately impact lower-income households, and fuel Reform UK criticism of the government's net zero agenda.

“The government is too focused on heat pumps… for many in the worst-performing houses, a heat pump isn’t the solution that dramatically changes bills,"" one anonymous Labour MP told the newspaper.

The Tony Blair Institute think tank (TBI), which has close links to the Keir Starmer Labour government, warned in October that the government's plan to achieve clean power by 2030 needed reform, arguing that earlier policies were ""launched in the middle of the gas crisis and in a low-interest environment, it was right for its time, but circumstances have changed"".","https://res.cloudinary.com/dyw8mv3b0/image/upload/q_85,w_1200,h_1200,c_limit/v1/news/2026_01/3DA7T5P_dptb32.jpg",N,,2026-01-10 18:58:48.987301

By Dan Murphy

Westchester Congressman Mike Lawler took to the House floor on Dec. 16, to blast the leadership of both parties, yes even his own republican leadership, over both sides lack of interest in solving the expiration of the Obamacare, ACA, tax credits. This resulted in huge premium increases for the millions of americans who rely on the ACA.

Lawler said, “For 43 days. The Democrats shut down the government and they said it was over the issue of the ACA premium tax credits. I went and confronted Leader Jeffries, and I asked him to sign on to a one year extension. He refused. When the government finally opened, I and a number of my Republican and Democratic colleagues sat down in good faith to negotiate an extension of the ACA premium tax credits with reforms, because we recognize that this system as designed is not working. That Obamacare is not actually reducing health care costs in America. And in fact, since it took effect, health care premiums have risen by 96%.

“But we understood that to allow the premium tax credits to expire would hurt the American people. And so we sat down and negotiated, and we came up with several plans. And compromises along the way to ensure not only that there was an extension, but that we did eliminate fraud, that we did hold the insurance companies accountable, that we did actually start to reduce cost.

“We have put those bills forward on the floor in two separate discharge petitions. 11 Republicans have signed on to those discharge petitions. Now, why is that necessary? Because House Republican leadership will not allow a vote. It is idiotic. And shameful. And so we have been forced to sign on to two discharge petitions.

“And yet my Democratic colleagues will not join us. But for those that were at the negotiation table, the Democratic leader will not release his members to sign those two discharge petitions. Why? Because he doesn’t actually want to solve the problem. He wants the issue. He wants the issue. Which is precisely why Senator Schumer put a three year clean extension on the Senate floor that was doomed to fail because it doesn’t have bipartisan compromise.

“This place is disgraceful. Everybody wants the upper hand. Everybody wants the political advantage. They don’t actually want to do the damn work. This problem could be solved today if everybody who says they care about extending this signs the discharge. It could be solved today. And we could say to the leadership on both sides, a pox on both your houses.

“Both of you are failing this country. Both of you are failing this institution and move the bill forward. So the challenge I have for every one of my colleagues is put the party crap aside and sign the damn discharge today. If you want this, vote to move. If you want to extend these subsidies, if you want to make sure that the American people’s health care premiums don’t skyrocket, then go sign the discharge. Now, because we all understand one thing. You need 218 here and you need 60 in the Senate. We saw the three year extension with no reforms fail last week. So to just say that we’re going to hold out and wait to see if four Republicans sign the three year extension that you know is destined to fail in the Senate is a failure of leadership and responsibility.

“So, Leader Jeffries, come down to this floor, sign the discharge and show real leadership, because sadly, my conference has failed to do that. And all of us, as representatives of our own districts and our own constituents, have a responsibility to stand up. It’s why I met with my Democratic colleagues as soon as the government was reopened to negotiate in good faith. It’s why people like Brian Fitzpatrick and Jen Higgins and David Valadao have been leading on this issue, with folks like Jared Golden and Josh Gottheimer and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Tom Suozzi, because we understand this needs to get done. And the failure of members on both sides of the aisle who know it needs to get done, but they just want the issue, or they don’t want to do it because they hate Obamacare. Yeah, we know Obamacare failed. We know it’s not actually reducing costs. But you can’t fix it with nothing. So do your job and sign the discharge,” said Lawler.

The enhanced subsidies (also known as enhanced premium tax credits) for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance plans expired on December 31, 2025.

These temporary enhancements—first introduced in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025 by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act—made subsidies more generous (e.g., capping premiums at a lower percentage of income) and eliminated the “subsidy cliff” for incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level. Congress did not extend them further, so they lapsed at the end of 2025, affecting coverage starting in 2026.

The original ACA premium tax credits (subsidies) remain permanent and available in 2026 for eligible enrollees (generally those with incomes 100-400% of the federal poverty level), but they are less generous than the enhanced version. This has led to significantly higher out-of-pocket premiums for millions of marketplace enrollees in 2026.",https://yonkerstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mlcp-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:03.704709

Illinois will then be able to add large-scale capacity to its nuclear fleet, which already has more power reactors than any other site—11 across six plant sites.

New views: The CRGA was passed by the Illinois General Assembly on October 30, 2025, clearing the state Senate by a vote of 37–22 and the state House by 70–37. Pritzker’s signing of this legislation represented a shift from his August 2023 veto of a bill that would have lifted the state’s large reactor moratorium. At that time, he condemned that bill for “open[ing] the door to the proliferation of large-scale nuclear reactors that are so costly to build that they will cause exorbitant ratepayer-funded bailouts.”

Later that same year, Pritzker signed a bill to allow the construction of small modular reactors in Illinois. Now, the signing of the CRGA indicates that Pritzker wants the state to attract new nuclear investments.

At a press event announcing the new act in Joliet, Pritzker said, “In Illinois, we are pursuing every available option to produce affordable, efficient, clean, and abundant energy. We are leaving no stone unturned in the work to produce more electricity, lower prices for our people, and secure our long-term energy future. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard in the effort to lower energy costs and marks a historic step forward in our clean energy vision. Once again, Illinois is stepping up where the federal government is failing.”

Other provisions: There are several other provisions of the CRGA besides the lifting of the reactor moratorium. The act establishes a state procurement goal of 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030. It requires utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs that will reward participating households and businesses for using smart thermostats, solar panels, small batteries, and electric vehicles. The act also requires utilities that are administering state energy-efficiency programs to meet a minimum level of spending to help low-income households.

Additional provisions of the CRGA include the creation of an integrated resource planning process to find ways to keep energy bills low and make improvements to state programs, a requirement for the Illinois Power Agency to propose long-term clean energy contract procurements for Illinois Commerce Commission approval, and an increase in the maximum size for community solar projects to 10 MW.",https://www.ans.org/file/23125/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 18:12:40.083236

Shaheen was joined by fuel delivery companies, advocates and members of Strafford County Community Action Partnership (CAPSC). Prior to the roundtable, Shaheen toured Gafney Home, CAPSC’s new, energy efficient and affordable housing facility for older adults. Photos from today’s event can be found HERE.

“Energy costs are always a top concern for families and businesses, especially during New Hampshire’s cold winters,” said Senator Shaheen. “The Trump Administration’s misguided actions are keeping electricity and home heating costs high instead of lowering them, so I appreciated hearing directly from folks on the ground about the challenges they’re facing as a result. With so many Granite Staters already feeling squeezed by the high cost of household expenses, it remains one of my top priorities to protect federal programs that help families lower their energy bills and stay warm in their homes.”

At a time when the cost of living is top a concern, Shaheen has led the charge in Washington to protect federal programs that help Granite Staters afford their energy bills and make energy efficiency updates that save money. Thanks to Shaheen’s efforts, the administration recently released delayed federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding, which more than 57,000 Granite Staters rely on to help pay their home heating bills. Shaheen has condemned efforts by the Trump Administration to eliminate staff responsible for administering the LIHEAP program.

Shaheen was a key supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act and a lead negotiator of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, legislation that made landmark investments in energy efficiency. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Shaheen helped secure $3.5 billion in additional funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program, including $18 million for New Hampshire. Shaheen has long-championed the Weatherization Assistance Program to lower energy costs for low-income families in New Hampshire, as well as the State Energy Program, which assists states with the development of energy efficiency renewable projects. In December, the New Hampshire delegation called on the Department of Energy to immediately release the remaining $9 million in funding for weatherization from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In addition, Shaheen led the delegation in opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to terminate a $43 million grant for New Hampshire to support community solar and other solar projects that would reduce residents’ utility bills by 20% or more.

Community Wealth Building in action Tilley remains Tiree’s financial backbone, but after major repairs it is uninsurable and nearing the end of its life.
The work done by the Tiree Community Development Trust shows what Community Wealth Building looks like in practice.
It reflects a wider shift – now enshrined in the Community Wealth Building Bill going through Holyrood – to root economic power closer to communities.
For Community Land Scotland and its members, Chalmers says Community Wealth Building “resonates with a lot of communities because it really describes what they’re doing naturally.","Approaching the wind-buffeted island of Tiree after a four-hour ferry journey, visitors and residents alike are greeted by the sight of Tilley – the community-owned wind turbine that rises fifty metres above the Atlantic. More than a landmark, Tilley has become a symbol of what happens when a community takes its future into its own hands.

“We are very lucky,” says Phyl Meyer, Chief Officer of Tiree Community Development Trust (Urras Thiriodh). “We’ve got a wind turbine right now that is providing the vast majority of funding, which allows my staff and I to be here to do all of these things and to professionally run projects and services.”

Like many rural and island communities, Tiree’s population has been declining for many years, as people move to the mainland to look for jobs, housing and other opportunities they couldn’t find on the island. Local people became increasingly worried about the sustainability of the school, and the risk of a tipping point for further population decline.

“There are families who are considering leaving the island because of the lack of childcare,” says Meyer. “And if we lose those families, it’s the impact of their jobs not being filled anymore, and how we replace them, less kids in the school, potential threats to the funding for that, etc. It’s all interconnected and if one domino falls over, another domino falls and another. We spend a lot of our time worrying about how we head off the cascading dominoes.”

In 2006 a group of local people came together to take the future of the island into their own hands, based on the belief that the community needed to generate its own income to be able to make the investments needed in the community, and set up Tiree Community Development Trust.

Their ambitious plan to harness the powerful natural resource flying over their heads paid off. Managed through the trading arm Tiree Renewable Energy Ltd, Tilley – a 900 kW turbine – has channelled about £4 million back into the community of just 650 people, funding everything from critical infrastructure to essential community services.

When the island’s two main harbours were crumbling, threatening the viability of the local fishing fleet, the Trust led a major regeneration, securing the livelihoods of dozens of families. When the island’s only petrol station faced closure, they built a replacement, sparing residents a two-day trip to the mainland for fuel. They run a community broadband service – recently the only working connection after a major storm – and rescued the village shop, which is now also a post office.

To further nurture local enterprise, they constructed four modern business units, providing permanent space for a hairdresser, art gallery and creative social enterprise, allowing small businesses to thrive where they once struggled for space. Now, with housing being the most urgent need on the island the Trust is driving forward a major project to build affordable community-owned homes.

Their work goes beyond physical infrastructure. The income from Tilley also funds a full-time youth officer who runs a year-round programme of activities, to make Tiree a vibrant place for children to grow up, a Ranger Service to manage tourism, a home energy efficiency improvement and community advice service, a vital electric community minibus and provides small grants for local groups.

At their core, the Trust is responsive to community needs, building solutions and resilience against the threat of domino effects, where one missing service can collapse the viability of industries, ways of life, and ultimately the community itself. Currently the Trust is working to find a solution to the retirement of the last vet on the island, exploring a community-owned practice to ensure the crofting economy remains viable, and working to develop a solution to the lack of childcare on the island.

Rhoda Meek, Head of Communications and Gaelic, says: “The work that community development trusts do is absolutely vital in places like this. You could argue these are things that should be done from a statutory level, but we are where we are. Our development trusts are vital for healthy communities and to keep economic development going.”

“We’re not just about one project,” she adds. “You’re running a petrol station, a business centre, broadband, youth work and a heritage centre, and you’ve only got a population of 650. It’s a lot.

“Core funding is what’s missing. You can get capital to build something shiny, but you can’t get money to keep it running or pay people properly.”

Networks Behind the Success

But this success of community ownership doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It requires an equally expert support system. Enter Community Land Scotland (CLS), an intermediary body providing the critical support organisations like the Tiree Trust need.

More than 500 communities across Scotland have taken ownership of buildings and land, covering over 200,000 hectares. As the representative body for Scotland’s community landowners CLS underpins that movement by providing specialist advice, peer learning and national advocacy.

“Our strength in Scotland is that breadth and the way organisations work together,” says Linsay Chalmers, Director of Communities & Operations at CLS. “We support emerging and existing community landowners with networking and peer-to-peer learning opportunities.”

When Tiree began tackling its housing crisis – nearly half of homes are empty or used seasonally – CLS helped by arranging visits to Eigg and Knoydart so the Trust could learn directly from peers who had already delivered affordable homes. That exchange of experience saved time, risk and money.

CLS also supported Tiree’s Gaelic work, providing funding for a development project and convening community groups on Raasay to share learning. Rhoda Meek who works on developing Gaelic on the island says: “Gaelic is hugely linked to crofting and to the sea. For those of us whose roots are in Tiree, our grandfathers fished and worked the ground. Crofting and fishing are still a huge part of our local economy – vitally important and completely intertwined with our Gaelic language and culture.”

Other networks and organisations – Development Trusts Association Scotland, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) – have also provided invaluable technical and financial support, such as funding their new solar array and upgrading insulation in community buildings.

For the leaders doing this challenging work, the connections forged by these intermediary bodies and the support they provide are a lifeline.

Community Wealth Building in action

Tilley remains Tiree’s financial backbone, but after major repairs it is uninsurable and nearing the end of its life. As Meyer says: “If that turbine breaks tomorrow, we are not insured for loss of business. There will be a cliff edge that we will fall off without more core funding from the government.”

In response, the Trust is investing in more resilient and scalable solar arrays and exploring a local energy co-op to keep profits circulating locally. The strategy is clear: resilience through community ownership.

The work done by the Tiree Community Development Trust shows what Community Wealth Building looks like in practice. Wealth created locally stays local. Contractors are hired on the island, surpluses fund new services and decisions are made by residents.

It reflects a wider shift – now enshrined in the Community Wealth Building Bill going through Holyrood – to root economic power closer to communities. The Bill would require public bodies to develop local action plans that help generate, circulate and retain wealth within their areas.

For Community Land Scotland and its members, Chalmers says Community Wealth Building “resonates with a lot of communities because it really describes what they’re doing naturally. A lot of our members’ models are about creating wealth and reinvesting that back in their communities.”

Josh Doble, Director of Policy & Advocacy at Community Land Scotland highlights that some members have concerns that the Bill won’t do what it needs to. He says there’s been some discussion about a lack of clarity about what ‘wealth’ means and too much focus on state-led approaches: “There’s a fear that Community Wealth Building becomes too fixated on economics, and doesn’t capture the holistic benefits it can deliver for local communities. There’s a danger of it just becoming government jargon rather than a genuinely transformative way of rewiring the economy. That’s why we want to show that communities are already doing community wealth building, so successful community-led approaches don’t get lost.”

Jill Keegan, Partnerships Manager at Scottish Community Alliance, agrees: “Communities have been doing this for decades. The Bill is an opportunity for government and other stakeholders to make what’s already happening easier and more sustainable.”

Tiree’s story shows that Community Wealth Building isn’t a theory – it’s already happening. It’s being built from the ground up by local people, delivering real results, and filling the gaps where both market and state have struggled to keep rural places alive. What the island needs now is meaningful long term support to enable them to continue meeting the local community’s needs, ensuring life on Tiree remains viable and resilient for future generations.",https://www.scottishbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CWB-Tiree-3-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 18:58:53.735384

But experts who have researched radar interference from offshore wind farms have found that it can be addressed with technological fixes and training for boat captains.","It was three days before Christmas, and Patrick Crowley was getting ready for a holiday party when he got a shocking text.

Mr. Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island A.F.L.-C.I.O., learned that the Trump administration had halted construction on Revolution Wind, a nearly completed $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that employed hundreds of his members.

Again.

The same thing had happened in August, stunning leaders in Connecticut and Rhode Island, where the wind farm was expected to power more than 350,000 homes and businesses once completed. But the two states and Orsted, the Danish energy giant behind Revolution Wind, had sued and in September a federal judge had allowed construction on the project to resume.

Months had passed since that initial disruption. Construction was now 87 percent complete, with 58 of 65 wind turbines installed.

“People at the Christmas party were really in shock,” Mr. Crowley said. “We had already gone through this in August.”

Businesses around the world have been roiled by President Trump’s sudden policy shifts. But few have had it worse than offshore wind companies.

In its abrupt Dec. 22 announcement, the Trump administration halted work on all five wind farms currently under construction off the East Coast. They are collectively worth $25 billion and were expected to power more than 2.5 million buildings and create around 10,000 jobs.

The five wind farms were pioneers in what President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had hoped would be a new era of offshore wind power in the United States. The Biden administration had vetted the projects and awarded the permits, allowing the developers to secure financing, sign contracts to sell the electricity to states and utilities, hire workers, lease equipment and begin construction.

The projects — Revolution Wind, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind off New York, Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia — would join two smaller operating offshore wind farms in U.S. coastal waters.

Now, workers are idled in the middle of winter, when other construction jobs are scarce. The companies building the wind farms are hemorrhaging tens of millions of dollars a day. Some have said that if the work stoppage lasts much longer, they may have to abandon their projects altogether, absorbing billions of dollars in losses and laying off thousands of workers.

Developers of four of the five wind farms, along with the states of Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island, are suing to try to restart construction. Court hearings start on Monday and rulings could come as soon as next week.

This account of the turbulence in the country’s nascent offshore wind industry is based on interviews with more than a dozen union workers, energy lobbyists and politicians in both parties as well as a review of hundreds of pages of court filings. Some of the individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations.

Several people used the word “whiplash” to describe the shifting status of the five wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Interior Department notified developers of the latest halt just minutes before Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced it on Fox News. And Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat of Connecticut, found out from a call from Mr. Burgum soon afterward.

Mr. Lamont said that he told the secretary, “You’re a business guy. I thought this was a pro-business administration. This is incredibly anti-business. It’s so erratic, helter-skelter, back-and-forth, on-again, off-again.”

White House officials say their stance on offshore wind power has not changed since Mr. Trump’s first day back in office, when he issued a memorandum freezing approvals of all new wind projects on federal lands and waters. The president has repeatedly called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient.

A brief reprieve

In the months leading up to the December stoppage, many lobbyists and executives at offshore wind companies had thought the political turmoil was over and the projects could safely proceed.

The outlook seemed stable enough for Equinor, the developer of the $5 billion Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., to pour an additional $1.5 billion into the project since May, court filings show.

The Trump administration had paused construction on Empire Wind in April but allowed it to restart in May after weeks of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York. The administration suggested it had relented only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state, although Ms. Hochul has denied that such a deal was made.

Everything seemed to have returned to normal throughout the fall. Even on Friday, Dec. 19, just three days before the latest stoppage, many developers thought their projects were in the clear, according to two Republican energy lobbyists briefed on the matter.

But that day, senior administration officials met to discuss a classified report by the Defense Department that found the projects could threaten national security by interfering with radar systems, the two lobbyists said. By Monday, the administration announced it was pausing the leases that all five projects hold to build and operate in federal waters.

Representatives for Orsted and Equinor, who had been meeting regularly with officials from the Interior Department and the Coast Guard throughout the fall, were blindsided. Not once had any national security concerns ever come up, the companies both said in legal filings.

The Defense Department had repeatedly reviewed the plans for all five wind farms for years after they were proposed, and the companies had taken steps requested by the military to reduce impacts on radar systems. Dominion Energy, the developer of the largest stalled wind farm off Virginia, had paid $250,000 to upgrade military radar in the area.

Orsted, Equinor and Dominion have asked the Trump administration to give classified briefings on its concerns to representatives who hold national security clearances. But to date the Pentagon has not granted these requests, the companies said in legal filings.

“We have been clear and consistent that we are ready to address any additional national security concerns that were not already addressed over our lengthy engagement with defense agencies,” said Molly Morris, a senior vice president at Equinor overseeing Empire Wind.

“So this does come as a surprise to us,” she added, “and we have not been given access to the top secret evidence that apparently is available now.”

Orsted and Dominion declined to comment beyond what was in their public court filings.

Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Republican of New Jersey and a leading critic of offshore wind power on Capitol Hill, said he thought the national security concerns were legitimate. “If someone were to try to suggest that Trump is just using the Department of Defense as a vehicle or a tool in order to stop wind, I don’t think that’s accurate,” he said.

But experts who have researched radar interference from offshore wind farms have found that it can be addressed with technological fixes and training for boat captains.

“It is a known problem and it has been studied, but it doesn’t seem like the problem can’t be resolved,” said Frank Rusco, the director of natural resources and environment at the Government Accountability Office and an author of an April 2025 report on the topic.

From ‘dire’ to ‘near terminal’

Shutting down a partly built, multibillion-dollar wind farm in the middle of the ocean is neither cheap nor easy.

That’s because these projects involve a careful choreography of specialized workers, equipment and ships. Any delays can cause the entire timeline to unravel.

At Revolution Wind, Orsted is using a 450-foot-long ship called the Wind Scylla to install towering steel turbines. The ship is only under contract until Feb. 22 and then is scheduled to depart for other projects around the world.

Off the shores of Long Island, Empire Wind is in an even more precarious position.

Initially, the Interior Department allowed Equinor to conduct activities deemed necessary for health and safety, such as its work installing a 3,000-ton electrical substation in the ocean that would include lighting systems to help ships and aircraft avoid collisions in the area.

But the agency ordered a halt to most of these activities, too, on Jan. 5 with little explanation.

“This development turned a dire situation for Empire Wind into a near terminal one,” lawyers for Equinor wrote in a court filing. The company said that if it could not resume work by Jan. 16, it would likely have to cancel Empire Wind altogether because the vessel needed to lift the substation onto its foundations has to leave this month and would not become available for at least another year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10cli-offshore-wind-01-jwkl/10cli-offshore-wind-01-jwkl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 14:58:53.799627

Last year, Climate Superfund bills in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia stalled.","The controversial Climate Superfund Act, in all likelihood, will not advance in this legislative session.

But it will likely get new life when the 222nd legislative session begins Tuesday, albeit with a different name.

What is certain, however, is the bill, which seeks to retroactively penalize New Jersey companies $50 billion for legally providing fossil fuels that are essential to residents' survival and prosperity, may still have a mountain to climb from a strictly legal standpoint.

In key written and verbal testimony to the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee this week, New Jersey Civil Justice Institute President Elissa Frank raised the three main obstacles – among others - which may be difficult to overcome.

One right off the top is its conflict with the federal Clean Air Act.

“Congress enacted the Clean Air Act to create a comprehensive national framework for regulating greenhouse gas emissions, delegating primary authority to the United States Environmental Protection Agency,” Frank told lawmakers on Thursday.

“States may play a cooperative role, but they do not have the authority to regulate out-of-state emissions or impose liability for global atmospheric conditions. This bill attempts to do just that, which creates a direct conflict with federal law.”

Frank also noted that the bill raises “serious due process concerns” with its retroactive approach.

“The bill retroactively penalizes businesses for activities that federal and state governments not only permitted but affirmatively encouraged for decades as part of national energy policy,” Frank said.

“Imposing massive liability now, after the fact, on a narrow subset of New Jersey companies upends settled expectations and does so in an arbitrary and disproportionate manner, particularly while ignoring the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emitters.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, New Jersey contributes just 1.7% of the United States’ GHG emissions and only 0.3% of worldwide emissions.

Frank also noted the bill runs afoul of the federal interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

“By imposing liability for lawful extraction and refining activities that occurred outside of the state of New Jersey, the bill attempts to regulate conduct beyond the state's borders in violation of the U.S. Commerce Clause,” she said.

“Greenhouse gas emissions are global by nature, and this bill improperly assigns responsibility for worldwide emissions to a handful of in-state businesses.

Frank noted that NJCJI advocates for “a fair, predictable, and efficient civil justice system that supports investment, job creation, and critically, affordability for, for New Jersey families and businesses.”

And the Climate Superfund Act, which was suddenly renamed by sponsors without any explanation to the ""Polluters Pay to Make New Jersey Affordable Act"" on Thursday, likely didn’t pass legal muster in other smaller details, according to Frank’s written testimony.

“This bill is legally deficient, constitutionally suspect, and guaranteed to embroil our courts in prolonged and costly litigation, diverting judicial resources and undermining the predictability of New Jersey's civil justice system,” Frank said.

WATCHING OTHER STATES

Both New York and Vermont have voted for similar Climate Superfund laws, and the federal Department of Justice filed lawsuits last May against both states seeking to invalidate their statutes and block enforcement, citing them as ""lawless overreach.”

Also last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute filed a federal lawsuit against the state of Vermont, the first state to enact a climate Superfund law even though the state does not produce or refine fossil fuels.

Decisions on those lawsuits could be coming in the first half of 2026. And other states will be watching.

Last year, Climate Superfund bills in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia stalled. Other states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon, Rhode Island and Tennessee also did not take action last year, despite consideration of the rule previously.

Presumably, they’re waiting on the outcome of the Vermont and New York lawsuits.

“Each state’s case has, or will have, unique circumstances,” NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor said. “But what’s important to remember is that for all the ideological grandstanding or costly cash grabs that are attempted, the validity of these laws will come down to the courts.

“And we do expect they will have a long way to go to pass legal muster.”",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-2026-01-09T233146.373.png,N,,2026-01-10 13:59:30.942112

Investing in circular economy, partnerships and business resilience According to Dirk, sustainability at Volkswagen extends far beyond decarbonisation and EVs.
“We invest up to €25m per year into biodiversity projects – to demonstrate we can restore, regenerate or maintain nature,” Dirk says.
“Regenerative Plus was the first building block of the group strategy.
Building the future Volkswagen Group foresees electrification as central to the future of mobility.","Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s leading automotive conglomerates, is transforming its sustainability ambitions with a blueprint intended to regenerate value for people, planet and business. Leading this strategy is Chief Sustainability Officer Dirk Voeste.

Over the past two and a half years, Dirk has brought fresh perspective from a diverse background – first as a biologist, then as a space scientist and later as sustainability lead for chemical giant BASF – to Volkswagen Group, which encompasses brands such as Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, Škoda, SEAT and more. His decision to join Volkswagen was an unplanned, dynamic step, shaped by a sense of duty to “clean up something our generation left”, as encouraged by his family.​

“To me, it’s about impact – but it’s also about business and how we drive it,” Dirk explains.

See the full feature in issue 60 of Sustainability Magazine, sister title to Manufacturing Digital.

The foundations of VW’s sustainability strategy

Much of VW’s work builds on what Dirk describes as “enormous, energising, impactful” activity – connecting technical innovation with deep-rooted values, strategising for long-term effect and embedding a culture where sustainability is a shared language and business imperative.

Despite his science-based entry point into sustainability through aerospace, agricultural and chemical sectors, Dirk’s approach at VW pivots around a four-pillared philosophy. The Regenerate+ strategy reframes traditional models, moving from the classic triad of environment, society and business to an expanded quartet:

Nature

Society

Business

People.​

“Volkswagen has 670,000 employees worldwide,” Dirk explains. “I think they need a voice, especially when transforming from analogue to digital, from combustion to electric.”

The result is a new, holistic vision for Volkswagen Group which defines sustainability as creating value “for today’s and future generations, nature, society and business”. It prioritises measurable impact across the value chain and links purpose and profitability inseparably in the Group’s strategy.​ Dirk insists, “It has to make business sense, it’s not philanthropic”.

Sustainability, he argues, becomes “real and tangible” only when it delivers benefits for customers and stakeholders, whether those are more efficient vehicles, lower emissions or improved user experience. “An electric vehicle, for example, is super efficient,” Dirk explains. “A regular ID.7 model runs with 20 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometres – equivalent to two litres of diesel. It offers enormous efficiency, less maintenance and quieter driving – once people drive electric, we rarely see them switch back.”​

The four pillars of Volkswagen’s Regenerate+ strategy are each tracked by dedicated KPIs. “We track these holistically, but always with a business lens,” Dirk says. “Sometimes certain projects engage our neighbourhood, but meeting the business case is vital.”

Sustainability-first strategy

Volkswagen Group’s Regenerate+ strategy was launched by CEO Oliver Blume in Berlin before the company’s wider strategy to highlight leadership commitment.

“Our suppliers also need to see we’re really staying close,” Dirk explains. “It has to be pragmatic, ingrained in the culture.”

The strategy’s legitimacy rests on rigorous transparency through progress reports. Volkswagen reports quantifiable progress each year, responding to the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Investing in circular economy, partnerships and business resilience

According to Dirk, sustainability at Volkswagen extends far beyond decarbonisation and EVs. Central to the Regenerate+ strategy is the circular economy, which seeks to minimise extraction of new materials and maximise recycling and reuse across the vehicle life-cycle.

“Circular economy hits all our pillars – nature, decarbonisation, people, society and business. It’s a really overarching topic,” Dirk explains.

For automotive manufacturing, this involves steel, glass, aluminium, polymers and used parts, returned and refurbished for new use.​

“Why should we take more resources out than we already have?” Dirk asks. “Half of the copper demand could be met from recycled material, which is not currently being recycled. Circular economy helps reduce the carbon footprint, creates untapped value streams in automotive and is a form of business resilience. It makes sense regionally, too, by strengthening supply chains and reducing risk.”

VW’s supplier network is vast – more than 60,000 – operating under strict sustainability ratings. “We’ve set a target, so by 2040, 95% of our relevant suppliers need an A or B rating,” Dirk says. “We’re at 83% now. We talk to suppliers, de-risk, understand problems and help them improve.”​

This link between circularity, resilience and financial performance is vital. “If you reduce your carbon footprint, you take out energy, reduce costs and become more robust and competitive,” Dirk says. By focusing on partnerships for sustainability, Volkswagen also mitigates supply risk and controls costs, enhancing long-term competitiveness. “Sustainability is also about partnerships,” Dirk explains. “You can’t do it alone – you need partners in all instances, whether it’s decarbonisation, technologies or circular economy.”

Biodiversity and nature restoration: beyond the factory gates

For Volkswagen Group, responsibility for nature and biodiversity is integral to its sustainability mission. The company builds up to nine million cars annually, with 114 global assets and an expansive supply chain, all of which impact nature directly or indirectly. “If nature gets out of balance, we as a society have an issue,” Dirk says. “As a car manufacturer, you have an impact on nature – streets, production sites, supply chains.”​

VW’s solution is twofold – internal supply chain dialogue using sustainability ratings and a new annual biodiversity fund worth up to €25m (US$29.2m) for direct restoration projects. “We invest up to €25m per year into biodiversity projects – to demonstrate we can restore, regenerate or maintain nature,” Dirk says.

“If this works in our suppliers and own assets, it’s a form of resilience. It’s not philanthropic, but a business reason. If you can combine both, the better.”

The Group also empowers employees across its global brands – whether in Germany, France, UK, Canada, Spain, China or beyond – with an internal sustainability impact fund. This supports grassroots proposals for neighbourhood engagement, energy efficiency and process innovation in plant operations. “Ownership is with the people,” Dirk stresses.

Staff empowerment and organisational engagement in sustainability

Stakeholder buy-in is central to Volkswagen’s sustainability transformation. Employee engagement is encouraged, not only via financial backing but by fostering transparent dialogue. “In the last year, over 9,000 initiatives reduced energy consumption, saving 3.5 million megawatt hours annually – all through small, sustained changes,” Dirk says.

Governance is refreshed, too. A ‘sustainability practice group’ model supports each of Regenerate+’ four pillars, with three internal and three external experts on areas like nature, society, people and business. Advisory groups meet at least twice yearly with the board, cross-pollinating expertise between the World Wildlife Fund, biodiversity specialists and zero-carbon NGOs, as well as project leaders.

This network drives actionable knowledge and holds the organisation accountable. “You can always call the expert – on circular economy, decarbonisation, biodiversity – when you need help,” he says. Compared to standard advisory boards, this interactive, dynamic approach is a distinct innovation.

Commitment to delivering impact

Volkswagen’s commitment to measurable impact is evident across operations. The Zero Impact Factory programme targets all production facilities, aiming for near-zero environmental impact by 2040, ahead of the group’s overall target for 2050. Renewable energy will power Group factories by 2030, with transparent annual public reporting. “Wherever we can, we push the needle forward,” says Dirk. “If we’re in control, let’s do what we can to drive the topic.”

A key differentiator, he adds, is the sequencing of sustainability initiatives ahead of mainstream business strategy. “Regenerative Plus was the first building block of the group strategy. A completely different way of doing it, really unique. Thanks to Oliver, we did it this way.”

Even in the face of market uncertainty and geopolitical turbulence, Volkswagen has committed to ‘staying the course.’ The future is clear: leadership, consistency and ambition are non-negotiable.

Building the future

Volkswagen Group foresees electrification as central to the future of mobility. “Electrification will be the future. I’m not criticising combustion, but EVs are quieter, easier to use, super convenient, cool in summer and heated in winter – the future will be electric,” Dirk says.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/309cb1ea5e55302b3875fb04c5f5ddb8:16364b48f3146acac216ea55933cb9ed/vw-cso-2.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:00:22.922772

The question before justices in Chevron v. Plaquemines is whether Chevron can remove the lawsuit from state court to federal court if they are sued over actions connected to federal contracts?

Louisiana disputes the premise entirely, arguing the case against Chevron has nothing to do with a federal contract.

“There is no federal contract that this arises under,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an interview. “Hard stop – we win.”

There were indeed federal contracts between the U.S. government and Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, to refine aviation gasoline for the war effort during World War II. But those were purchase agreements, not directives, Louisiana argues – deals that didn’t tell Texaco where to drill, how to operate in Louisiana’s coastal zone or to engage in the conduct the parish is now suing over decades later.

“They just said, ‘We’ll buy it from you,’” Murrill said from Washington, D.C., where she is preparing for Monday’s arguments. “You can get it from anybody you want, and we will buy it from you.”

Murrill’s point is that a procurement contract like that doesn’t make all of a company’s operations federally directed. World War II ended in 1945, she noted, while Plaquemines Parish’s claims center on activities that continued for decades afterward and, in the state’s view, violated Louisiana’s coastal permitting law adopted in 1979.

Chevron, however, will argue that the distinction doesn’t matter. The company says the federal-officer removal statute is intentionally broad — allowing not only federal officers but also private contractors “acting under” them to move cases to federal court when the claims are “for or relating to” work done under federal authority.

The companies say the parishes’ claims over oil-field production are intertwined with the refining that supplied the federal war effort, and that both activities were closely linked and federally supervised during World War II – enough to justify federal jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, Louisiana’s coastal parishes have filed more than 40 similar lawsuits over the past decade, alleging that oil-and-gas operations contributed to the state’s catastrophic land loss. In the first case to reach a jury, Plaquemines Parish won a verdict of about $744.6 million against Chevron.

The companies say those kinds of local verdicts are precisely why Congress created a path to federal court. Supporters argue that allowing such suits to remain in local venues risks bias in favor of local governments with massive sums on the line. Murrill said the total exposure across all the cases is “definitely in the multi-billions.”

Industry supporters warn that if the Supreme Court upholds Louisiana’s position, contractors could hesitate to take on federally directed work for fear of being exposed to local lawsuits decades later. “The question,” said former Justice Department attorney Mike Fragoso, “is whether contractors will keep doing federally directed work if they are exposed to this kind of tort liability down the line.”

The U.S. Solicitor General has sided with Chevron and other companies, requesting and receiving 10 minutes of argument time.

Fragoso pointed out that the case is ultimately about federal supremacy: even though states are sovereigns, the federal government is supreme, and contractors doing the federal government’s work shouldn’t be forced to defend that work in local courts. Fragoso invoked Chief Justice John Marshall’s warning that “the power to tax is the power to destroy,” arguing that the power to hit federal contractors with massive local verdicts can be an even more potent way to undermine federal operations.

“I think that it's convenient for them to say that,” Murrill said, noting her reputation as a virulent defender of the energy industry. “All the regulations and laws that we have effect now have not inhibited our ability to conduct warfare.”",https://delta.creativecirclecdn.com/lpn/original/20260109-101941-703-d43d6-LA%20Attorney%20Liz%20Murrill.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:13:29.928529

As anti-oil and gas activists seek legal pathways to straddle the energy industry, U.S. companies are making less effective products at higher prices to comply with demands while customers suffer, industry insiders argue.

On Monday, justices in the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in Plaquemines Parish v. Chevron. The legal battle centers around whether Chevron can move a case to federal court when federal government contracts are involved.

Plaquemines Parish, in Louisiana, originally sought damages from multiple oil and gas companies for allegedly engaging in oil and gas production on the coast without securing proper permits or violating preexisting permits.

Some of the violations date back to the World War II-era, when the federal government had production contracts with energy companies now owned by Chevron. The parish argues these contracts did not detail the methods by which companies were to obtain the oil and gas, leaving them liable for violating state permitting laws.

Louisiana’s coastal parishes have filed more than 40 similar lawsuits, claiming that oil and gas companies are responsible for coastal land loss in Louisiana. As the first case to reach a jury, Plaquemines Parish won a verdict of $744.6 million in damages against Chevron, which appealed.

Jason Isaac, founder of the American Energy Institute, told The Center Square a Supreme Court ruling in favor of Plaquemines Parish could be “devastating” for American energy companies.

“It’s essentially a tax on energy,” Isaac said. “This could be bad for consumers, it could be really bad for American energy independence and American energy dominance.”

He said the case is an attempt to pin the loss of coastal wetlands and certain weather events to a particular company over a period of several decades.

“They’re trying to make the claim that they can go back and look at every single bit of emissions and attribute certain weather events to that,” Isaac said.

A separate case, Suncor Energy v. Boulder County Commissioners, has also caught the attention of the nation’s highest court. The case focuses on whether state and local governments can file public nuisance lawsuits against oil and gas companies for global climate change effects.

“Public nuisance can’t be used for global problems. It can be used for local problems,” O.H. Skinner, executive director of Alliance for Consumers, told The Center Square.

The U.S. Supreme Court distributed the case for its Dec. 12 conference but did not decide whether to deny it or pick it up. The court relisted the case for its Jan. 9 conference and may decide whether to take it on Monday.

Isaac said the only reason the high court is still considering another energy case is because lower courts have yet to hear its merits.

“Courts recognize that cities can’t use local lawsuits to control global climate policy or rewrite federal energy law,” Isaac said. “Boulder’s longevity reflects delay and avoidance, not legal strength.”

While not all are being heard before the Supreme Court, similar litigation against energy companies is occurring throughout the country. Wrongful death lawsuits, state nuisance laws and near-total plastic bans are seeing fierce litigation.

Isaac said the cases stem from political desires to affect lasting change in the U.S. energy industry. He said Democrat-backed organizations will offer to cover attorneys and legal fees in law firms across the country to pursue litigation against large energy companies.

“They’re essentially a private firm becoming a de-facto government agency going after legitimate businesses here in the United States,” Isaac said. “The implications of these cases are to the tunes of billions of dollars.

Some companies and independent producers have experienced uncertainty due to fears associated with energy procurement lawsuits. Isaac said American Energy Institute’s member companies have settled certain lawsuits to avoid expensive court proceedings.

“That increases the cost that gets passed on to the consumer in the end,” Isaac said.

Increased consumer prices lead to less effective appliances in the home, Skinner told The Center Square. As executive director of the Alliance for Consumers, he said rules imposed on manufacturers to be climate friendly results in a less effective product.

“If you keep telling somebody that they have to use less water, less heat, less electricity, things take longer and they don’t do as well,” Skinner said.

As climate litigation is pursued across the country, Isaac and Skinner said they are concerned about increasing regulations that straddle companies from making the most efficient product.

“I don’t think people are recognizing that they’re truly getting hammered with their electric utility bills because these companies and states continue to mandate so-called green energy,” Isaac said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/0a/90ac18b2-9211-43f9-8ac8-2929d34c84e8/68dab8ca9ced3.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2026-01-10 18:12:57.940141

Many different creatures call the American prairie home, from the lovable, shaggy buffalo to the endangered rusty patched bumblebee.

Often overlooked, this prairie is actually one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, with numbers of species rivaling those of tropical rainforests. But it’s also one of the most threatened. Today, just one percent of eastern tallgrass prairie remains, and western shortgrass prairie is disappearing at a rate of more than a million acres a year.

Authors Josephine Marcotty and Dave Hage have teamed up to document the rapid destruction of these grasslands and the people working to save them. Their new book is “Sea of Grass: The Conquest, Ruin, and Redemption of Nature on the American Prairie.” This interview with Josephine Marcotty has been edited for length and clarity.

PALOMA BELTRAN: How did the idea for “Sea of Grass” first come about?

JOSEPHINE MARCOTTY: Like most people in this country, growing up, I really had little or no contact with the prairie because it was gone. I grew up in a suburb of Detroit, and the prairie was something I read about in books like Laura Ingalls Wilder, but not something that I had experienced. It was only when I started exploring the prairie that was left and understanding what we had lost that inspired me to write, not only about agriculture, but about what we were losing by expanding agriculture in the Midwest.

BELTRAN: Can you describe the American prairie for us? What does it feel like to visit such a place and what makes it special?

MARCOTTY: The tallgrass prairie, which is now almost completely gone, used to be an extraordinary place where grasses would be taller than a standing person, and in order to see over the top of them, you had to stand on top of a horse. It was a place where people could get lost—and often did in those tall grasses—or in the massive wetlands that used to occupy a third or 25 percent of the middle part of the country. It was an extraordinary place full of animals that we no longer have, wolves and bears and other carnivores, extraordinary birds.

The thing that I like about a prairie is the immense silence. All you hear is the sound of wind, and that enormous sense of space that you get, which is very similar to being out on a great lake or out on an ocean. Those are, of course, also lovely. But a grassland is just different.

BELTRAN: It sounds beautiful. Let’s talk about one of the main characters in your book, the buffalo. Tell us about how these large, lovable mammals fit into the narrative about grasslands and conservation.

Bison carry seed across thousands of miles when they eat the grass, and then they move the seed up to other parts of the grassland. That’s really important for evolution and mixing genetics amongst plants, so they create an environment that’s good for other species that use the same ecosystem.

BELTRAN: “Sea of Grass” centers on what you and Hage call the “paradox of the prairie.” Please explain this concept and why it’s especially relevant today.

MARCOTTY: The paradox of the prairie is partly rooted in the fear that early colonialists had when they first encountered it. It is a vast grassland, and that’s not something that most Europeans had experience with. They didn’t like that openness. They were fearful of the wetlands; they would easily get lost. The winters were terrifying because they were cold and windy, but it was, at the same time, a remarkably fertile place. At first, they thought nothing would grow there because there were no forests, and they thought, well, there must be just bad soil. But it turned out to be the most productive soil in the world, as we know now, based on our agricultural output from those former grasslands. So that’s one of the paradoxes.

BELTRAN: I think most of us don’t really equate prairies with biodiversity, but they are actually some of the richest ecosystems in the world. A recent study showed that the number of organisms present in grassland soil even rival the Amazon rainforest. What are some of the benefits of healthy prairies for humans and also for our planet?

MARCOTTY: There is a whole world and a whole ecosystem beneath your feet when you’re on a prairie, because the soil is so deep, and also because the roots of prairie plants are so long.

Kentucky bluegrass, which is the kind of grass we often grow in our yards, is only about six inches deep in the roots. But other plants, like the cup plant, those roots can extend down 15 feet into the soil, so they create a whole universe of organisms around them, and that’s an excellent way of sequestering and processing carbon, of sequestering and processing nitrogen, both of which are very important for world health in terms of air pollution and in terms of climate change.

The world’s grasslands contain more carbon than humans have released since the Industrial Revolution, more than the planet’s forests and atmosphere. At the current rate of plowing up Western grasslands, we’re plowing up about a million acres a year, and that’s the equivalent of adding 11.2 million cars to the road every year.

BELTRAN: How are we losing our grasslands in the United States at such an astonishing rate?

MARCOTTY: For many, many decades, intensive agriculture stopped at around the 98th parallel because it was too dry in the West to really grow crops properly. Instead, that’s why we have cattle there—it was good country for cattle and bison. But through genetic technology, we now are creating seeds, like for corn, that are much more capable of withstanding severe weather, that can thrive in dry conditions. The profits from that are much greater than from growing cattle. You can sell a piece of land that has been plowed for a much higher price than you can sell it if it hasn’t been plowed.

BELTRAN: So prairies are vanishing largely due to commercial agriculture replacing grasslands with monoculture crops. To what extent is industrial farming to blame for the disappearance of the prairies?

MARCOTTY: Yes, it’s mostly agriculture. If you look at a map, or if you fly over the country, what you will see is farmland below you when you fly over the Midwest. What’s driven the loss of grasslands really is agriculture, and much of that, in recent years, is driven by ethanol, which is a fuel derived from corn.

Ethanol was created in part to create a new market for corn, and the price of corn increased dramatically after those ethanol mandates were established by the federal government. That has driven a lot of the expansion of agriculture—just growing corn for our gas tanks.

BELTRAN: Of course, the assault on prairies couldn’t have been possible without the forced removal of Indigenous peoples from their native land. Describe for us how native farming practices differ from industrial farming and how Indigenous peoples know to protect the land they live on.

MARCOTTY: Native American people grew crops for their own consumption. They would grow a variety of food depending on where they were. They would have corn, they would have beans, they would have squash. They had much more diversity within their farming system, and so they could grow their food on a plot of land, and when the soil played out, they could move on to another place and grow food in another spot and let that area recover and become more fertile.

When European colonialists came in, they began to grow food for markets. So they grew far more food than they needed for themselves, and then they would sell the extra. Indians didn’t function like that. They didn’t have a capitalist system. They were people who grew their food for themselves and for their community, and they just grew what they needed for a season or for a year.

Bison were the primary source of food for Western Native Americans for many, many, many years, and they still are. In the last several decades, there has been a push to bring the bison from Yellowstone National Park and return them to the Native Americans and the tribal lands that used to rely on them, and this has been a great story of revival, not only for bison, but also for those native tribes to be able to have food sovereignty and their own source of food, and also to develop businesses around that source of food that they can generate income for their communities.

BELTRAN: Your book details the struggle between the farming industry and land conservation in the American West, but it sounds like restoring prairies is actually beneficial to farmers and to people everywhere. Could you describe that contradiction?

MARCOTTY: One of the contradictions is that we have many different viewpoints and opinions on what land is for. Farmers, the agricultural industry and farming communities often believe that land is best used to produce food and to produce crops, and that that is the economic engine of those small, rural communities. That’s been true for hundreds of years. That is the basis of what drove much of colonialism across the country.

But at the same time, one of the chapters we have in our book is about a prairie restoration in Northwest Minnesota called Glacial Ridge. It is the largest prairie restoration in the country; it’s like 24,000 acres. And The Nature Conservancy and the other organizations that helped restore that prairie, one of the reasons they were able to do that was because the tiny, little city of Crookston, which is primarily an agricultural economic city, needed a place to get clean drinking water, and they were able to put the city’s drinking wells in this restored prairie and know that they would never be contaminated with fertilizer or with other farm contaminants. Just clean drinking water alone is one real benefit.

The other, of course, is pollinators. The prairie is a place where you find more pollinators than almost anywhere else in the country, and we need those pollinators to pollinate the crops that we eat for food. There are estimates that pollinators have declined by up to 25 percent in some parts of the country, and we’re losing bumblebees at a high rate. The rusty patched bumblebee is on the endangered species list because it’s disappeared in much of the prairie states. Those are just two of the ecosystem services that prairies can provide.

BELTRAN: You talk to multiple farmers and people within the agricultural industry for your book. What’s their sentiment around the loss of the prairie and the loss of our grasslands?

MARCOTTY: I think many of them grieve it. Many people who live on the grasslands today love it the same way we all love the place where we grow up and appreciate its beauty, its wildlife and what it means to them culturally.

But it’s very difficult to compete with corn. If you are a rancher that owns land, and you want to retire, and all of your pension, all of your savings, are essentially the land that you own, and the only way that you can sell it is to sell it to someone who wants to raise corn and soybeans on it, you’re in kind of a bad spot. You don’t have a lot of options in terms of finding another rancher who wants to raise cattle on it. It’s going to be much easier in many places to sell it to someone who wants to raise corn.

Farmers are caught in a system, just like the rest of us. We are all part of a food system that we created and that we rely on. They don’t have a lot of room to experiment with different kinds of growing systems or different kinds of crops, and they often feel like they can’t really afford to let grasslands be and to maintain grasslands. For them, land has to produce. They need to make money on it.

BELTRAN: The farming industry relies heavily on support from the federal government, including from important legislation like the Farm Bill, which provides aid for farmers through programs like crop insurance and funding for research and development. How can the Farm Bill aid in preventing the loss and collapse of the American prairie while continuing to support farmers?

MARCOTTY: One of the things that would help a lot would be parity. The Farm Bill is designed to help certain kinds of farmers—the people who grow corn and soybeans and other commodities like cotton. It is not designed to help people who grow cattle. Grasslands need grazers. Ungulates have been a part of the grassland system for millions of years, and humans need ungulates, or animals on the land, because that is the way that we turn sunshine into protein, is those animals who graze on the grasslands.

It’s enormously important for our diets and for our food system, but the protections that ranchers get, or anybody who raises animals on the land, is not equal to what you get if you are raising corn or soybeans. If Congress was able to provide parity so that all farmers and all producers, whether you’re a rancher or even a fisherman, if you also had the same kind of protections from risk that farmers have, that would give landowners much greater diversity in what they can grow on the land.

BELTRAN: What are some of the restoration efforts currently taking place across the country?

MARCOTTY: There’s a bill that’s been introduced called the Grassland Act, and it would help protect existing prairies by providing support for ranchers and by installing protections elsewhere in the law. So that is one thing we could do—pass some policy that is designed to protect grasslands.

Minnesota is one of the only states that has a statewide plan to protect prairies, and they’re doing a lot to buy up marginal cropland and converting it back to prairies, and helping landowners who have prairies protect them and understand what they have and how to manage them. It is really important for the nation and for the federal government to recognize that they are something of immense value that needs to be protected.

There are many ecosystems that are under threat. The prairie is just one of them that we thought the risks to were not recognized and needed to be recognized. But all of the outdoors is under threat, either from agriculture or development or from pollution, and the way to really protect all of them is for people to get outside and understand what they have and what they can do to stop whatever destruction is going on.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1143011799-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:58:23.981714

Jan 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI and SoftBank Group will invest $500 million each in SB Energy to expand data center and power ​infrastructure for their Stargate initiative, SB Energy said on Friday.

SB ‌Energy, a SoftBank-owned company, will build and operate OpenAI's previously announced 1.2-gigawatt data center ‌site in Milam County, Texas.

SB Energy will also become a customer of OpenAI, using its APIs and deploying ChatGPT for employees.

Stargate is a $500 billion multi-year initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference, ⁠backed by major investors ‌including Oracle. President Donald Trump backed the initiative when the companies announced the plan in January 2025.

Tech companies ‍are investing directly in power infrastructure as energy access becomes a critical constraint on AI expansion, with the push for larger and more numerous data centers ​driving electricity demand higher.

The partnership ""accelerates our delivery of advanced AI data center campuses and associated energy infrastructure at the scale required to advance Stargate and secure America's AI future,"" SB Energy co-CEO Rich Hossfeld said.

The data center construction boom has also ⁠prompted major players including Meta Platforms to ​allocate unprecedented sums to infrastructure projects that ​require massive investments in chips, power, cooling, and servers.

Meanwhile, OpenAI faces rising expenses for training and operating its AI ‍systems amid intensifying ⁠competition from Alphabet's Google.

CEO Sam Altman told staff late last year that the company has entered a ""code red"" mode focused on ⁠enhancing ChatGPT, while delaying launches of other products, as it moved to counter ‌Gemini's growing traction.

Congress came back to Washington this week with significant unfinished business, particularly on government funding. Coming off the largest government shutdown in history late last year, it needs to pass the remaining nine of 12 government funding bills for fiscal year 2026 by January 30 in order to avert yet another shutdown. Congress passed the first three bills (Legislative Branch, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Agriculture) in November as part of a compromise to end the shutdown. The House this week passed a package of three more spending bills (Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, and Commerce-Justice-Science). The Senate will vote on that package as soon as next week. Passage of these three bills provides some momentum for lawmakers to finish their work. However, the remaining six bills, which include Defense, Labor-Health-Education and Homeland Security, are the most contentious. They also are important since they make up nearly 70% of all federal discretionary spending. Congress has only three weeks to reconcile key differences and pass the remaining bills. Congress may need to extend current funding for the remaining government agencies through another continuing resolution (that could be a short-term extension to buy some more time or an extension through the end of the fiscal year).

Health Care.

While back at home, many lawmakers heard from constituents about expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. Last month, House Democrats received support from four Republicans to force a vote on renewing the (now expired) ACA subsidies for three years. The House passed that bill in a 230-196 vote, with 17 Republicans joining Democrats. However, the bill’s prospects are not good in the Senate, which voted down similar measures last month. With Republican leadership showing little interest in having another vote on a simple extension, a bipartisan group of senators have been working on finding an alternative. That could combine a short-term extension with income caps and a minimum premium requirement. There are major obstacles. One is timing given that open enrollment for ACA plans ends January 15. Also complicating matters is Republicans’ desire to expand the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the use of federal dollars from being used for abortion. In a meeting with Republicans this week, President Trump urged Republicans to be flexible on the issue, though many Republicans disagree. Meanwhile, Democrats are staunchly opposed to any Hyde amendment expansion. While bipartisan discussions continue, there seems like little chance of a breakthrough.

Foreign Policy.

The Trump administration last year had a more assertive and active agenda on foreign policy than many expected. There was a wide breadth of activity, but key areas of focus included trade, relations with China, diplomacy in the Middle East and efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Late last year, the Trump administration issued a national security report that called for the US to pursue national interests (particularly military and economic strength) while mostly avoiding foreign military entanglements. The report breaks from a longstanding US worldview that positioned the US as an indispensable leader in promoting an international order built around security and economic ties with allies (particularly other democracies), multilateral institutions and international rules. Seeing a global order where regional powers (including the US) can and will exercise power in their respective spheres of influence, the Trump administration this past week has put its national security strategy into practice and set the tone for another active year with its military action in Venezuela, renewed calls for acquiring Greenland, and withdrawal of the US from dozens of international organizations.

Venezuela. The Trump administration’s actions to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro quickly became a key preoccupation of Congress. Reactions have fallen mainly along party lines, with most Republicans publicly supporting the President and virtually all Democrats decrying the actions. In addition to concerns about the legality of these actions, there are questions about the US’s ongoing role in the country and in its oil sector (Venezuela has a degraded oil infrastructure that will require significant investment, but it also has the world’s largest oil reserves). Following the military operation in Venezuela, the Trump administration has thrown out threats for future military action elsewhere in the world and has amped up talk of acquiring Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Republicans have largely brushed this off, there are some simmering concerns. Reflecting that, five Republicans joined all Senate Democrats in a procedural vote to advance a war powers resolution that would prohibit any new military action in Venezuela without congressional authority. While the resolution is largely symbolic and likely won’t pass the House, the vote shows some Republican concerns. Further war powers resolutions (Greenland, Cuba, and others) could follow. Beyond the immediate questions about Venezuela and any further US actions in the western hemisphere, a big geopolitical question on the horizon concerns the degree to which other regional powers, including traditional US adversaries, will see the US’s actions and its overall national security doctrine as a green light to assert their interests and prerogatives in their spheres of influence.

China. US-China relations last year had a roller-coaster ride, with tensions ebbing and flowing and with cumulative tariffs on goods from China briefly reaching over 160%. They ended on a stable note as the Trump administration worked with urgency last fall to deescalate another brewing trade fight. Those efforts yielded a détente (nominally a one-year reprieve) between the two countries. This year will be punctuated by planned visits between President Trump and President Xi (a visit to China in April and potentially a state visit in the US later in the year). Given China’s dominance in the mining and processing of rare earth metals that are critical for many key technologies, the US will look to maintain the current truce, though there is plenty of risk of bumps in the road.

Ukraine. A peace deal to end the war in Ukraine continues to be elusive and a key objective of the Trump administration. President Trump has pushed Ukraine to make territorial and other concessions in the interest of having de-escalation with Russia. However, it has been Russia that has shown little interest in ending the war. While there is a possibility of a breakthrough, the base case remains of quagmire on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.

Trade Decisions.

There will be many key milestones on trade this year. The biggest is the Supreme Court’s decision on the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to apply broad-based “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners. The court returns next week and is expected to make its decision on an expedited basis. An adverse decision would be a big blow for the Trump administration’s trade agenda. If that were to happen, the Trump administration likely would reimpose tariffs through other authorities. Using other broad-based authorities would allow them to keep many of the tariffs in place, but that would be subject to similar legal challenges and vulnerabilities. Alternatively, it could rely more on sectoral and other tariffs that rest on a stronger legal foundation, though the composition of that tariff regime (and the industries and trading partners it would impact) would be different and take time to implement. The administration’s efforts on sectoral tariffs are ongoing no matter what the court decision is. It has investigations on establishing new tariffs in the coming months in areas such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals and civilian aircraft. The US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is up for review and renewal (by July 2026), and President Trump may use this deadline as a means to extract concessions by renewing tariff and other threats on these neighbors and trading partners. The upcoming Supreme Court decision will be the starting point rather than the end point for another active year on trade developments.

Reconciliation 2.0?

As mentioned, Republicans’ main legislative achievement last year was the One Big Beautiful Bill. They advanced the bill through the process of reconciliation. The process allows changes to federal tax and spending policies to be considered on a more streamlined basis. The key advantage is only a majority is needed in the Senate instead of the 60-vote threshold applicable to most legislation. Some Republicans are interested in doing another reconciliation bill this year. A Republican plan on healthcare could be an anchor for such a bill, which also could include additional tax measures. President Trump has promoted the idea of using tariff revenue for some sort of stimulus check to Americans and that could be a candidate for inclusion in a reconciliation bill. However, beyond the legal questions regarding many of the tariffs, there are questions about the design of any such plan and concerns about its cost. We are skeptical of any Reconciliation 2.0 effort moving forward, but we will be paying close attention to developments given that it can’t be entirely ruled out.

Crypto Bill.

Digital assets policy will continue to be a major focus for Congress and the administration. Last year, Congress passed bipartisan legislation (called the GENIUS Act) that established a new regulatory framework for stablecoins (digital assets issued by private entities but backed by other assets including fiat currencies like the dollar). The House also passed a crypto market structure bill that would set rules for the trading of digital assets and delineate regulatory authority between the SEC (securities) and the CFTC (commodities). However, despite active bipartisan discussions over months, progress has been slower in the Senate. Market structure legislation is a more complex and contentious undertaking than the stablecoin bill. Differences remain on key issues, including rules around conflicts of interest, decentralized trading, and payment of interest on stablecoins. Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) plans to move ahead with a mark-up next week, but that may only produce a party-line vote given the lingering differences on key issues. With many unresolved issues and a ticking political clock before the midterm elections, efforts to pass a crypto market structure bill continue to face stiff headwinds.

Fed Drama Continues.

Last year, President Trump frequently criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s conduct of monetary policy and the cost of a renovation of the Fed’s facilities. Despite frequent threats, he has refrained from attempting to fire Powell (there also are legal protections in place that would prevent Powell from being fired without cause). President Trump did take an unprecedented step last year in trying to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook (on the grounds of alleged mortgage fraud). The attempted firing has been subject to litigation, with the Supreme Court scheduled to hear oral arguments on the case on January 21. In September, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran (former head of the Council of Economic Advisors) to fill a temporary vacancy. The big upcoming development will be Trump’s announcement of his choice to place Powell. That person will need Senate approval and won’t take over until the end of Powell’s term in May, but an announcement is expected in the coming weeks. With ongoing concerns about the impact of attacks on the Fed’s independence, this will be a closely watched transition process.

Other Policy Issues.

President Trump will deliver a State of the Union address on February 24, where he will make his pitch on the administration’s policies ahead of the midterm elections. Congress faces an April 20 deadline to renew the contentious Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Artificial intelligence (AI) will remain a key interest in Washington but will be more the province of executive and regulatory action than legislative. The Trump administration issued a comprehensive action plan on AI last year and a recent order aimed at thwarting state-level regulation of AI. There are bipartisan efforts on different piecemeal measures to try to address the affordability of housing measures in both the Senate and House, but it remains to be seen whether there is sufficient time and inclination to work out differences between the different approaches. Trump recently weighed in with support for a ban on large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, but many Republicans are opposed. There also are a number of end of fiscal year deadlines that Congress will need to tackle. Lawmakers will try to garner momentum to reauthorize US farm and food aid programs, but they may need to punt again with an extension before current policies expire on September 30. Congress also will need to pass a five-year reauthorization of highway and infrastructure legislation by September 30. Lawmakers are looking to revive bipartisan negotiations around permitting reform for energy and infrastructure projects. The House has passed permitting bills, but discussions are stalled in Senate. The aforementioned transportation bill could be a vehicle for any permitting reform package. Congress also must reauthorize the Export-Import Bank by September 30. The Senate will continue to pass Trump’s nominees throughout the year. There will be many issues on Congress’s radar screen, but most have little pathway for legislative success this year.

Midterms Loom.

If past is precedent, Congress’s focus will shift almost entirely to campaigning by the spring. While the landscape still could shift, both parties already have signaled what their lanes will be in the months ahead. Democrats continue to lean heavily into affordability, arguing that President Trump won on promises to reduce costs but has instead amplified the problem while turning his attention abroad. Republicans, for their part, will try to localize contests and try to distance themselves from Trump’s low approval ratings as they confront tough historical headwinds. With congressional control up for grabs and 2028 hopefuls already maneuvering behind the scenes, the political climate only will intensify from here.

House. Republicans entered the cycle with a narrow 220–215 majority. In a typical midterm, the party out of power gains seats. This has been true in 18 of the last 20 cycles, with an average pickup of 26 seats. Particularly with positive results in certain elections held last year, Democrats at first blush are in a good position to retake the House. However, mid‑decade redistricting across nearly a dozen states has significantly reduced the number of true toss‑up districts (now roughly 25). As a result, Democrats would need to win close to 85% of the most competitive seats to reclaim the majority. In today’s polarized climate, national swings tend to move districts uniformly. This isn’t impossible, but it is far from guaranteed. The House remains the likeliest chamber to flip, but the path is narrower and more complicated than historical trends would suggest.

Senate. Republicans hold a 53–47 majority, and the map tilts in their favor. Because Vice President Vance will continue to cast the tiebreaking vote next Congress, Democrats need a net gain of four seats to retake control. Their route begins with holding difficult seats in Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire while flipping Republican seats in Maine and North Carolina. Even if they run the table in all of these, they still need to flip two more seats. Their next opportunities in Alaska, Iowa, Ohio, and Florida have grown increasingly challenging. Their last target, Texas, remains the Democrats’ perennial white whale. Democrats point to strong 2025 showings and improved candidate quality as signs of momentum, but Republicans remain confident the structure of the map works in their favor. The Senate majority is not out of reach for Democrats, but it would require a near‑perfect night.

Governors. 36 states will elect governors this fall, with several competitive contests emerging, especially where incumbents are not seeking reelection. Democrats are defending closely watched races in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, and Wisconsin, with only Arizona featuring a sitting Democratic governor. Republicans have competitive defenses in Georgia, Nevada, and Iowa, with Georgia and Iowa lacking an incumbent. The stakes extend beyond state policy since governors can shape federal delegation dynamics, influence redistricting processes, and provide political coattails. There could be significant downstream effects in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas where Republican legislatures could be checked by Democratic governors and in states like Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin where Democratic legislatures could be checked by Republican governors. These races may draw less national attention than congressional contests, but their impact will be significant.",https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/washington-weekly/2026/washington-weekly-9-january/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.coreimg.jpg/757145923/washington-weekly-d.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:58:29.042581

Headquartered internationally in Vancouver, Canada, with existing U.S. operations in Southern California and West Virginia, GreenPower said the decision was driven by New Mexico’s growing electric vehicle ecosystem, the Santa Teresa Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), and a competitive package of state and local incentives.

The planned 135,000-square-foot facility will serve as GreenPower’s base for North American manufacturing and its U.S. corporate headquarters. The project is expected to generate more than $200 million in economic impact over the next decade and create over 340 jobs.

“GreenPower’s decision to locate in Santa Teresa represents a meaningful investment in our local workforce and economy,” said Davin Lopez, President and CEO of the Mesilla Valley Economic Development Alliance. “This project brings high-quality manufacturing jobs and reinforces the NMBorderplex’s role as a destination for sustainable, long-term growth.”

State and local support played a key role in securing the project. New Mexico leveraged several economic development programs—including the Local Economic Development Act (LEDA), the Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP), Rural Jobs Tax Credits, and the High-Wage Jobs Tax Credit—to support GreenPower’s expansion and workforce development plans.

In a statement released previously by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, GreenPower CEO Fraser Atkinson highlighted the company’s commitment to partnering with local communities, government leaders, and financial stakeholders. He noted that New Mexico’s expanding electrification and clean-energy ecosystem provides a strong foundation for sustainable manufacturing growth.

The Santa Teresa Foreign Trade Zone was another key factor, offering streamlined customs processes, supply-chain flexibility, and cost efficiencies—advantages that are increasingly important for manufacturers navigating global trade volatility.

“The Doña Ana County Foreign Trade Zone continues to be a powerful tool in attracting advanced manufacturing investment,” said Jerry Pacheco, Senior Business Recruiter with the New Mexico Partnership. “The FTZ enhances supply-chain efficiency and strengthens New Mexico’s competitive position.”

GreenPower’s move aligns with the state’s broader clean-energy goals. In 2025, the company partnered with the New Mexico Economic Development Department to launch the state’s first all-electric, zero-emission school bus pilot program, supporting the Energy Transition Act and New Mexico’s target of achieving 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045.

“We are proud to welcome GreenPower to Doña Ana County,” said County Manager Scott Andrews. “This announcement reflects strong collaboration across state, regional, and local partners and reinforces our region’s leadership in clean transportation and advanced manufacturing.”

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to extend the ​life of aging coal-fired power plants to continue to provide baseload power to meet the growing demand ‍for electricity from the buildout ​of data centers to power artificial intelligence.

KEY ​QUOTE

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ‍ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

CONTEXT

The administration last year issued five emergency orders to keep retiring coal plants running, most recently on December 30 when Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an order ‍to keep a coal plant in Craig, Colorado, operating even though it was set to retire at the end of ‍2025.

BACKGROUND

Colorado had ‍ordered three older coal plants that ​were set to retire in 2030 to ​shut ⁠down two years earlier to comply with ‌its regional haze plan. The EPA said it would help Colorado rewrite its plan, or else impose one on the state.

Colorado also has a state goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.

While Europe has a 28-year history of offshore wind, with about 18,000 MW of offshore wind power in operation, there is just one offshore wind farm in operation in the U.S, rated at 30 MW. Therefore, until the last couple years, estimating the price for major offshore wind projects in the United States was fairly speculative.

As some of the first commercial-scale offshore wind projects in the U.S. with purchase contracts signed, the New York and Massachusetts contracts provide some of the first data points of how much offshore wind power actually costs in the U.S. and they send a promising signal. While the New York price point of $83 per megawatt-hour (MWh) is much higher than the prices that utilities typically pay for wholesale power in the Southeast, it is a level that is far below what people expected offshore wind in the United States to cost even just a couple years ago.

The news is encouraging because it helps to show a trend of unexpectedly low-price offshore wind power contracts. Last year, the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts stunned people with a price of $98 per MWh (estimated) for 800 MW, which was then lowered even further through tax credits and other revenue. Then, the Revolution Wind project signed contracts with Connecticut and Rhode Island for $94 (to Connecticut) and $98.43 (to Rhode Island) per MWh for a combined 600 MW. And now, New York’s contracts come in at $83 per MWh for about 1,700 MW and while the exact pricing of Massachusetts’ new 800 MW contract is not yet publicly known, it is required by law to be lower than last year’s Vineyard Wind contract. [Editorial note: update on Dec. 5, 2019: and the new Park City wind project off Connecticut’s coast will be the least expensive of them all]

The recent wave of advancements toward offshore wind development appear to blunt the long held suspicion that the cost of offshore wind power development in the nascent United States market would be significantly higher than what it costs across the Atlantic in the more mature European market. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s analysis of the Vineyard Wind contract found its price consistent with European pricing, and we now know that Vineyard Wind’s pricing was not an outlier but rather the beginning of a trend.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-11 00:13:01.131176

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

DTE Energy Co. is not the kind of name that usually trends on social media. It is a century-old, Detroit-based utility whose core business is deceptively simple: keep the lights on and homes heated. But beneath that familiar surface, DTE Energy Co. is in the middle of one of the most consequential product overhauls in its history, transforming from a regulated power provider into a tech-enabled, decarbonizing energy platform.

That shift is not optional. Extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and rising expectations around clean energy and reliability are forcing utilities across the U.S. to rethink how they generate, transmit, and manage power. For DTE Energy Co., that means turning its service territory into a live testbed for large-scale renewable deployment, grid automation, and customer-facing digital tools that promise more transparency and control over energy use.

This is the real product story behind DTE Energy Co.: not a single device or app, but an integrated energy system that has to work 24/7, withstand climate shocks, satisfy regulators, and increasingly, hit ambitious climate targets—all while remaining affordable. In utility land, that combination is the equivalent of shipping a flagship smartphone every day that never crashes and can’t go offline.

Get all details on DTE Energy Co. here

Inside the Flagship: DTE Energy Co.

When analysts and regulators talk about DTE Energy Co. today, they are really talking about a bundle of interlocking products: a generation portfolio that is shifting from coal to gas and renewables, a high-voltage and distribution grid undergoing accelerated modernization, and a growing layer of digital services riding on top.

On the generation side, DTE Energy Co. is in the late stages of a structural pivot away from coal and toward a mix of natural gas, wind, solar, and energy efficiency programs. The company has committed billions of dollars in capital expenditure to building utility-scale wind and solar farms in Michigan, backed by long-term planning commitments to retire coal units and hit emissions reduction targets. Within its service territory, DTE’s renewables are no longer a side-show—they are becoming a core ""product line"" that shapes capacity planning, rate cases, and customer programs.

But the real technological story is in how DTE Energy Co. is stitching those generation assets to the customer’s meter. The company is deploying advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to give near-real-time visibility into energy usage. Those meters feed data into grid management platforms that can help pinpoint outages faster, reroute power, and eventually support more sophisticated demand-response programs. In practical terms, that means fewer blind spots when storms hit and more optionality for customers who want to shift usage or participate in peak reduction programs.

On the customer side, DTE Energy Co. has been rolling out online account management, usage dashboards, and mobile-accessible tools that allow residential and business users to track consumption, enroll in renewable or green tariff programs, and access energy efficiency rebates. Compared to the polished UX of a consumer tech giant, these interfaces still feel more functional than delightful, but the direction is clear: DTE Energy Co. is treating customer data and interaction as a product surface, not just a billing endpoint.

The utility is also expanding behind-the-meter offerings, such as energy efficiency programs and optional green power subscriptions for corporate clients who need to hit ESG targets. These offerings may not get the same buzz as rooftop solar installers or EV charging networks, but for Fortune 500 customers trying to decarbonize their footprints, utility-backed renewable programs can be the difference between a marketing slide and a verifiable carbon reduction strategy.

Underpinning all of this is a massive, multi-year grid modernization program. DTE Energy Co. is investing in substation upgrades, new circuits, undergrounding in targeted areas, automation devices, and enhanced vegetation management. Think of it as a forced migration from a largely analog, reactive grid to a more digital, sensor-heavy network that can be monitored, modeled, and managed in something close to real time. It is not as glamorous as a new gadget launch, but for customers, it directly translates into fewer outages and faster restoration.

Market Rivals: DTE Energy Co. Aktie vs. The Competition

In the world of regulated utilities, DTE Energy Co. does not have direct consumer-facing rivals in the way a phone or EV maker does. Its customers in Michigan cannot simply switch to another grid provider. But in capital markets and in the broader policy and technology arena, DTE Energy Co. competes every day with other large integrated utilities that are pitching a similar story of decarbonization and modernization.

Compared directly to NextEra Energy Inc.—often treated as the benchmark ""growth utility"" in North America—DTE Energy Co. is positioned more as a balanced, regionally focused operator. NextEra’s flagship product is its huge portfolio of wind and solar projects across multiple states, combined with a Florida-based regulated utility that has become a case study in hurricane hardening and solar deployment. Where NextEra Energy leans heavily into being a renewables developer at national scale, DTE Energy Co. is focused on retooling a single-region system with a mix of gas, renewables, and grid investments. That makes DTE’s story less explosive in growth terms but arguably more about execution under tight regulatory scrutiny.

Against Duke Energy Corp., another heavyweight in the U.S. power sector, DTE Energy Co. looks more nimble in certain ways. Duke spans multiple states across the Southeast and Midwest, and its capital plan includes nuclear, gas, and a rising share of renewables. However, that scale also drags in a complex web of state regulatory environments and political dynamics. DTE Energy Co., by being more geographically concentrated, has the advantage of aligning its grid and generation strategy with a single primary state regulatory framework and a focused decarbonization roadmap. For investors comparing DTE Energy Co. Aktie with a name like Duke, the trade-off is between national diversification and the ability to execute a coherent, region-specific transition.

There is also an emerging competitive comparison with utilities like Xcel Energy Inc., which have moved aggressively on clean energy commitments and have built strong brands around being early decarbonization leaders. Xcel’s flagship narrative centers on being among the first major U.S. utilities to set 100% clean or net-zero targets and integrate large-scale wind in the Midwest. DTE Energy Co. has moved slower historically, but in recent years it has stepped up its climate commitments and accelerated coal retirements, working to close that perception gap.

On the technology front, many of these competitors are leaning into similar themes: advanced metering, grid automation, EV charging support, and customer-facing digital tools. Where DTE Energy Co. is trying to differentiate is in how it packages these investments into a coherent reliability-and-resilience story for a state that has endured high-profile outage events. If NextEra is selling a pure-play renewables and growth story, and Duke is selling scale and stability, DTE Energy Co. is positioning its ""product"" as a real-world demonstration of how to harden a legacy Midwest grid while decarbonizing it.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

DTE Energy Co. will not win by being the flashiest name in clean energy. It wins, if it wins, by threading together innovation, regulatory alignment, and reliability in a way that feels tangible to both regulators and customers.

First, there is the integrated approach to modernization. DTE Energy Co. is not treating renewables as a bolt-on marketing line. Its capital plan ties wind and solar additions directly to coal retirements, grid investments, and customer programs. That integration matters: it reduces the risk that new renewable capacity becomes stranded or congested and makes it easier to argue for cost recovery in rate cases. Where some peers tout headline megawatt numbers, DTE Energy Co. is emphasizing system-level reliability and emissions benefits, which resonate with regulators and large industrial customers.

Second, the company’s focus on grid resilience in a storm-prone, aging infrastructure environment gives it a very clear problem to solve. Michigan customers remember multi-day outages and tree-downed lines; that lived experience sharpens the value proposition for grid automation, undergrounding, and aggressive vegetation management. The ""product"" is not an abstract promise of a clean future grid; it is a concrete reduction in outage frequency and duration, backed by specific investments and timelines.

Third, DTE Energy Co. is building out a customer-facing ecosystem that, while still maturing, turns energy usage data into a service platform. AMI-enabled insights, time-based rates, energy efficiency rebates, and optional renewable programs create an expanding menu of ways for customers to interact with their energy consumption. For corporate buyers under pressure to hit ESG goals, DTE’s ability to structure renewable contracts and green tariffs offers an increasingly important differentiator, effectively making the utility an embedded partner in their sustainability strategies.

Finally, DTE Energy Co. benefits from being a regulated utility with a relatively predictable cash flow profile, which underwrites its energy transition investments. Where pure-play renewable developers may ride boom-and-bust cycles tied to tax credits and merchant power prices, DTE’s regulated structure allows it to plan capital investments over long horizons with clearer cost recovery mechanisms. For the underlying product—the physical and digital grid—that stability is a feature, not a bug.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

DTE Energy Co. Aktie (ISIN US2333311072) trades in a market that increasingly prices utilities not just on current earnings and dividends, but on the credibility of their transition plans. As of the latest available trading session data accessed via multiple financial sources, DTE Energy Co.’s share price reflects the profile of a regulated utility in the midst of a multi-year capital deployment cycle: investors are effectively buying into a bond-like dividend stream plus a long-duration grid and renewables build-out.

Because the company’s ""product"" is long-lived infrastructure, markets react most strongly not to single technology announcements, but to updates on capital plans, regulatory settlements, and execution against reliability and decarbonization targets. When DTE Energy Co. secures approval for major grid modernization initiatives or accelerates the retirement schedule of coal plants in favor of renewables and gas, it is effectively shipping a new version of its core product. Those milestones tend to support the valuation narrative by signaling lower long-term carbon risk, higher potential rate base growth, and a pathway to more stable earnings.

Conversely, high-profile outage events or regulatory pushback on rate increases can pressure the stock, as they raise questions about the balance between investment, affordability, and execution capability. In that sense, the success of DTE Energy Co.’s modernization and decarbonization agenda is not just a climate or technology story—it is a valuation story. The better the company can demonstrate that its grid upgrades, renewables expansion, and customer-facing digital services translate into measurable reliability improvements and manageable rate impacts, the stronger the case for DTE Energy Co. Aktie as a steady, long-term compounder.

For investors, DTE Energy Co. represents a specific bet: that a Midwestern utility can transform its legacy coal-heavy system into a more digital, cleaner, and more resilient platform without triggering a regulatory or customer backlash. For customers, the bet is simpler: that the lights stay on more often, outages get shorter, and the energy they use gets cleaner over time. If DTE Energy Co. can continue to deliver on both fronts, its product—the modernized grid and the services layered on top—will become one of the more important, if least flashy, technology platforms in the region.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404994_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:13:23.267441

Toyota Motor Corp. confirmed it will plow as much as $10 billion into the US over the next five years to boost its local operations, less than a month after President Donald Trump flagged that the Japanese carmaker planned such an investment.

The announcement clears up a confusing moment from Trump’s visit to Tokyo in October, when he said Toyota would build plants all over the US “to the tune of over $10 billion.” At the time, the automaker wouldn’t confirm such a plan, calling it mere speculation.

The automaker provided no further details on how it will spend the funds. David Christ, Toyota’s US sales chief, said that will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll announce the investment plans for the $10 billion as we get closer to making the investments,” Christ told reporters Wednesday at a ceremony for a new battery plant in North Carolina.

The investment announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures the global auto industry to shift more production to the US and imposed punitive tariffs on many car parts and vehicles sourced from abroad.

Toyota’s top executive in the US, Ted Ogawa, said the battery plant and new investment “marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

The president called out Toyota by name earlier last year for importing too many vehicles from Japan to the US, and also singled it out during this first administration for building up manufacturing operations in Mexico.

In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in US manufacturing. The company said earlier this year that it had spent those funds and that its total investment in the US currently exceeds $50 billion — spread over nearly seven decades.

The Japanese company imported about half of the vehicles it sold in the US in 2024, mostly from Canada and Mexico but also including some 281,000 vehicles made in Japan.

The latest investment commitment was timed to coincide with the official opening of Toyota’s newest plant, a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility located near Greensboro, North Carolina.

Construction of the factory in the rural town of Liberty cost $13.9 billion and production is expected to slowly ramp up over the next decade. Toyota said it will create 5,100 new jobs and supply both hybrid gas-electric and all-electric models.

Swift About-Face

When Toyota first announced the US battery plant project in 2021, it envisioned a steady rise in Americans’ demand for EVs due in part to then-President Joe Biden’s efforts to speed adoption of zero-emission vehicles with favorable policies.

Trump’s return to the White House has led to a swift about-face in federal emissions regulations, including the abandonment of incentives for EV buyers such as a $7,500 tax credit.

Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles. Those will be installed in models such as the Camry mid-size sedan and hybrid versions of the Corolla Cross crossover and best-selling RAV4 compact SUV.

Three more lines will be added next year, one dedicated to batteries for 45,000 all-electric vehicles a year and two that can make batteries for an additional 74,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, Anne Souder, a plant general manager, told reporters at a briefing.

The carmaker aims for a total of 14 lines to be operational by 2034, but its decision to scale back ambitious plans to sell as many as seven EV models in the US has injected uncertainty into Toyota’s plans for production of all-electric vehicle batteries.

“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.

Demand for EVs has is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in US battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. That’s largely due to a 14 million-unit downward revision in projected US sales of EVs by then.

The carmaker delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric in the US in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics have skyrocketed.

But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.
Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project.
“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it.
“Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.” In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined.","This story first appeared in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here.

When the first turbine pieces for Vineyard Wind inched into port in 2023, cranes and union labor stood at the quayside of a nearby terminal, ready and waiting to get to work. In the more than two years since, the project has kept the state-owned New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal busy and funded through a multimillion dollar lease.

But the 26-acre site wasn’t always bustling.

Eight years before Vineyard Wind entered the scene, the state finished construction on the $113 million terminal, purpose-built to support offshore wind, a buzzy industry that hadn’t yet landed. The site expected to welcome Cape Wind as the first tenant around 2015, but the Nantucket Sound project fell through after opposition. The taxpayer-funded site remained underutilized for years, and was left to find new, and smaller, revenue streams.

Amid the Trump administration’s offshore wind crackdown, it will soon find itself in a similar predicament. As the final Vineyard Wind blades trickle out, two questions emerge: What now for the offshore wind terminal, and what now for New Bedford — a city that courted millions in investment and built out its port to support an industry that’s facing an existential threat?

In a best-case scenario, experts predict construction in Massachusetts will stall for the remaining years of the Trump administration. But the worst-case scenario: the uncertainty imposed by the Trump administration in these last 12 months may be too challenging for a future pro-wind administration to overcome, freezing development longer-term.

For those on the New Bedford waterfront, their concerns are tempered with optimism. It’s a long game, and they’ve begun laying the groundwork to pivot their businesses for a few years until the next wave comes.

Still, “if the president that follows [Trump] is as hostile as he is, then we may be looking at a much longer term problem,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.

What’s next at the Marine Commerce Terminal and Foss Terminal?

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a quasi-state agency that owns and operates the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, is currently undertaking a $45-million expansion of the site to support the larger and heavier “next generation” turbine components. It includes the addition of a few acres.

As that work has been underway, the site has largely emptied out with 61 of Vineyard Wind’s 62 turbines now towering above the Atlantic. The project’s lease with the terminal expires in June.

Before President Donald Trump was re-elected, MassCEC expected some lull at the site before the next project, which is supposed to be SouthCoast Wind. But the lull has had two years added to it, while SouthCoast Wind finds itself under increasing threat.

Bruce Carlisle, MassCEC’s managing director of offshore wind, wouldn’t provide much detail on the agency’s plans for the intervening years at the New Bedford site, stating staff have started to “put out feelers with interested parties.”

But Mitchell wants to know.

“There is going to be an extended period between projects. [MassCEC has] to figure out how to manage the in-between,” he said. “What we don’t want to see there in the interim is scrap metal or … other bottom of the barrel materials.”

Before Vineyard Wind, the terminal hosted land-based wind turbines, offshore wind research and survey vessels, recycled steel, ferry parking, modular building components, shipping containers, and timber piles. The terminal’s revenue was also millions less before Vineyard Wind arrived.

Just a minute or two drive north of the terminal is another wind site, the New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal — a private investment that remains under construction.

More than four years ago, city and state officials gathered at the then-abandoned power station to announce the site would take on new life to support a new generation of energy: wind.

Since 2024, the terminal has berthed offshore wind support and research vessels for Vineyard Wind and other projects. But it has become a bellwether of the industry’s stalling.

The original deed required the site to commit to exclusive use for renewable energy projects. But in October, Foss and city officials amended their agreement so the site may support transportation projects and storage of breakbulk (cargo too big to fit into a container).

The new agreement also temporarily allows the Seastreak Ferry to dock at the Foss terminal while it’s displaced from the closure of the State Pier. It allows parking for ferry customers — activities that have not been part of the terminal’s mission.

“We see there will be a lull,” said Andrew Saunders, president of the Foss terminal. “We see we need to adapt to what the market is.” He stressed their preferred market is “always the offshore wind market.”

If the next generation of wind projects was moving forward now, Saunders said he’d be in front of the city’s planning board to secure approval to build the terminal’s third phase: two 30,000-square-foot warehouses for wind developers.

But without power purchase agreements between the developers and utilities, the money won’t flow.

State proceeding with second wind terminal in Salem

Mitchell wants New Bedford to be competitive with ports not just outside Massachusetts, but in it. So despite the hits to the offshore wind industry, he sees a possible opportunity for New Bedford amid some of the federal actions.

He’s talking about the Salem terminal, a public-private partnership between MassCEC, the City of Salem and Crowley (a maritime logistics company) that’s been in development since 2022 to support what was then a steady pipeline of projects to be built off the commonwealth’s coast and the Gulf of Maine.

That pipeline has since frozen, and the proposed terminal — on the site of a former coal plant — had $34 million in federal funding terminated this summer. (That funding amounts to about 10% of the project’s budget, per the City of Salem.)

Carlisle said the federal backing was a “critical part” of the funding mix. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo in November said it alone is “not entirely fatal” to the project’s completion.

Mitchell asked whether it makes sense for the state to have two staging terminals, stating New Bedford’s will be available when the industry picks back up.

“It’s no secret we in New Bedford have long been concerned about the possibility of the proposed facility in Salem competing against New Bedford,” he said. “The state has to explain why it would, at this point in the game, allow that project to proceed, given there aren’t offshore wind projects that might use New Bedford for the foreseeable future.”

But MassCEC believes the future market — as well as plans for floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine — warrants a second marshaling site.

“We’re taking … the medium and the long view,” said Carlisle. “We are positioning ourselves for when this industry gets some traction again.”

Because the floating turbines in the Gulf of Maine will involve different technology, Carlisle said, the state needs a different port infrastructure to support it.

Pangallo, like Mitchell, is bullish on the industry’s long-term future — and his city playing a lead role in its buildout: “The horizon we see … is over decades, not just the next couple of years.”

Pangallo said the parties are exploring a phased buildout or possible redesign of the terminal to deal with the funding loss. He said they’re also exploring “other temporary alternative uses that could support the port’s operation in the interim.”

In other words, Salem’s future terminal is already facing a predicament similar to New Bedford’s after Cape Wind fell through.

Further complicating the terminal’s future plans: its anchor tenant, New England Wind, has been targeted by the Trump administration. The federal government has asked a court for the ability to reconsider its approval of the project’s construction plan — a permit necessary for buildout.

MassCEC in 2024 said the Salem site was expected to be operational by 2026. Not much work has progressed beyond a symbolic groundbreaking in the summer of 2024. Carlisle said he could not comment on the expected commercial operation date.

“The actions by the Trump administration certainly have led to more uncertainty on the part of developers and their ability to commit to leases, and that has impacted the long-term revenue and financing visibility for Salem,” Carlisle said. “But we are actively working with Crowley and the City of Salem as we speak on plans.”

Yearslong pause ahead

In the short to medium term, there will be “quieter times” at the ports that support offshore wind, said Kris Ohleth, director at the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a Delaware-based nonprofit.

“I think market and investor confidence is pretty much as low as it can possibly be,” she said, saying developers are contemplating submitting permitting documents near the end of Trump’s term — three years away.

“I would venture that the ones that started construction last year have been living in a perpetual state of fear and potentially regret that they did start,” Ohleth continued. “I can’t imagine any developer risking capital investment in this environment.”

The developers’ fears are reasonable. Two have seen their projects paused twice, costing millions in losses per day. And in December, all five projects under construction along the Atlantic coast were suspended, with the federal government citing national security concerns.

Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, believes a longer term freeze is in the realm of possibility.

“The question is… will we see the industry ramp back up after Trump leaves office?” said Fox. “Our new best-case scenario for long-term offshore wind is that this is a pause. But we’re not convinced it is. We think the administration has sought to inject so much uncertainty into the industry that there’s not going to be a lot of interest among investors and financiers.”

Because the permitting timelines are lengthy and often span two presidencies, developers have experienced pendulum swings in the approaches of Democrat and Republican administrations. This last swing has been so extreme that it could have more lasting impacts, experts say.

New Bedford jobs on ice

Though offshore wind is touted as a clean energy alternative, Mitchell sees the industry’s role and impact in New Bedford as an economic one. And with no project to follow once Vineyard Wind concludes its high-capital construction phase, that economic spout is expected to reduce to a trickle.

Mitchell said it concerns him, but he emphasized New Bedford never was, and never will be, a wind-only port.

“New Bedford is still primarily a fishing port. … That said, the recent contribution of marshaling of the Vineyard Wind project is a not insignificant contributor to the port’s total economic output,” he said. “It’s created jobs, opportunities for small businesses in the city.”

SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind, the two projects planned next for Massachusetts, face threats of having their federal permits and approvals revoked. They missed another deadline to secure power purchase agreements with the state utilities.

Each project promises about 100 jobs for the city, Mitchell previously estimated, including union labor.

Andy Benedetto, business representative at Local 1121, which includes carpenters and millwrights, said the union was in planning talks with SouthCoast Wind on what training and standards worked best.

But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.

“We invested millions into training people and building this workforce that now is just going to be more or less stagnant,” Benedetto said.

The National Offshore Wind Institute, a Bristol Community College site that opened in 2024 to train the union workforce and other industry members, is looking to pivot, like its waterfront neighbors.

Brianne McDonough, interim vice president for economic and business development at Bristol Community College, in an interview this fall said the school “designed the use of the building around wind,” but that it can train different industries, including oil, gas, and construction.

Some smaller-scale wind work may continue in the coming years out of New Bedford. That includes possible operations and maintenance work, and fishermen providing site and safety security for turbine installation or subsea cable laying.

Tony Alvernaz, a New Bedford scalloper, made it clear that he supports the Trump administration and opposes wind turbines being installed around fishing grounds. But, he’s also appreciative of the work he’s found with the industry.

Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project. His fishing boat will guard a bigger vessel as it lays cable. The job was set to start in February, but that’s unclear now that the project is suspended.

“I won’t say I’m grateful for [offshore wind],” Alvernaz said. “I’m grateful for the work I guess. Who knows where I would’ve been without this extra work.”

e’s glad to see a slowdown as it will allow research to catch up: “Now you get to see these guys fully permitted finish their projects… the pros and cons will come out in the next few years.”

Mitchell shared similar sentiments, saying the Trump administration’s revisiting and reconsideration of some lease siting with more weight given to fishing interests was necessary.

The speed at which the wind industry was taking off under the Biden administration, and even before, often sparked analogies about those involved building the ship as they’re sailing it. Now that it’s slowing — if not stopping — Ohleth offered a variation.

“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it. Now the plane is on the ground. That’s an opportunity,” she said. “Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.”

In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined. The foreign jack-up ships and retrofitted barges are in high demand and will return to Europe or the south to support other projects and industries.

But the local workforce, shoreside companies, terminals and smaller fishing boats that have built offshore wind into their business plans will need to pivot.

The resulting oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the green hydrogen is delivered to reinforced containers for safe storage.

During times when energy demand is highest, the system delivers the stored green hydrogen to an existing combustion turbine that has been upgraded – using GE Vernova technology – to run on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen or up to 100% hydrogen.

This process makes the natural gas turbines more flexible and diversifies Duke Energy Florida’s generation fleet to support the expansion of renewable energy.

Because the green hydrogen is an on-demand source of energy, the turbines can be turned on and off at any time – it is not dependent on the time of day or the weather.

The site’s reliability allows for more renewable, yet intermittent, energy sources – like solar – that displace the cost of fuel for customers while still meeting rising customer demand.

“Diverse generation is strong, reliable generation,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “The DeBary hydrogen project underscores Duke Energy Florida’s deep understanding of that notion and our commitment to making strategic infrastructure investments that will allow us to continue providing value for our customers while meeting their rapidly increasing demand for energy.”

“The DeBary system allows for safe, reliable generation and storage of clean energy,” said Reggie Anderson, Duke Energy Florida vice president of regulated and renewable energy. “Duke Energy Florida is proud of this successful innovation and the lasting impact it will have on our industry, our company and, most importantly, our customers.”

Please see below for more information on significant releases in December 2025.[1]

Business

IRS Releases Updated FAQs on Section 163(j): On Dec. 23, 2025, the IRS updated the frequently asked questions in Fact Sheet 2025-09 regarding the limitation on the deduction of business interest expenses (Section 163(j)) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The updated FAQs address the gross receipts tests, floor plan financing interest expenses, the adjusted taxable income (ATI) limitation calculation and other OBBBA changes.

Importantly, the FAQs note that for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024, the ATI limitation will again be based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

The updates also clarify that small businesses with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less for 2025 are exempt, even if the prior year’s additional interest carries forward. The FAQs define business interest expense as interest allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses (excluding employee services, electing real property/farming businesses and utilities). It also includes loans to finance trailers/campers held for sale or lease for taxable years after Dec. 31. 2024.

Education

IRS Issues Guidance on Scholarship Granting Organizations: On Dec. 12, 2025, the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2026-6, which establishes procedures for states to make an Advance Election to become a “covered state” under the new Section 25F credit for contributions to qualified scholarship granting organizations (SGOs), established by the OBBBA. The guidance allows a state to notify potential SGOs of the state’s participation in the new federal scholarship tax credit program before formally submitting the state’s SGO lists for calendar year 2027. States making the Advance Election must file Form 15714 between Jan. 1, 2026, and the deadline for submitting their SGO lists.

Energy

IRS Provides Safe Harbor for Carbon Capture Verification Standards: On Dec. 19, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-01, which provides a safe harbor for eligibility determinations for taxpayers claiming the Section 45Q Carbon Capture and Sequestration credit. The guidance allows sequestration data to be verified by an independent engineer or geologist beginning in tax year 2025 to ensure continued compliance until a long-term solution replaces the greenhouse gas reporting framework. The change follows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s September proposal to terminate its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for industrial facilities. Current regulations require section 45Q credit claimants to meet the requirements from this program for verification of sequestration volumes.

IRS Provides Information on Dyed Fuel Excise Tax for Taxpayers: On Dec. 22, 2025, the IRS issued Announcement 2026-01 informing taxpayers about refunds available for federal excise taxes paid on undyed diesel or kerosene that later exits a terminal as dyed fuel intended for tax-exempt purposes.

Health Care

IRS Issues Guidance for HSAs: On Dec. 9, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-05, which addresses questions regarding the OBBBA changes to health savings account (HSAs). The notice explains how high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) can now cover telehealth services without a deductible if they match Medicare’s list of over 250 approved remote care codes, with 2025 plans grandfathered in—although in-person visits, equipment or non-vaccine drugs typically are not eligible. It also describes how bronze and catastrophic plans from health insurance exchanges count as HDHPs even if they skip standard deductibles or spending caps (and work with employer reimbursement accounts like ICHRA), but small business exchange plans and recent Indian Health Services use often do not qualify. It also details Direct Primary Care arrangements, which will not preclude HSA use if they are just for basic primary care (by specific doctors or nurses), charge a flat monthly fee up to $150/$300 (individual/family) for up to a year, skip extras like anesthesia or lab tests outside a doctor’s office and let employers pay separately from the HDHP—HSAs can reimburse fees early, but higher fees block contributions while still qualifying as medical costs.

IRS Issues Fact Sheet Regarding Premium Tax Credits: On Dec. 23, 2025, the IRS updated the frequently asked questions in Fact Sheet 2025-10 regarding advanced premium tax credits (APTC). The changes highlight eligibility rules (income at least 100% of federal poverty line, no affordable employer/government coverage, non-Married Filing Separately except for abuse victims), household income definition (modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) plus certain exclusions), affordability tests for employer plans and PTC computation (second-lowest silver plan minus income percentage, reconciled via Form 8962 and Form 1095-A). It also states that taxpayers must reconcile APTC on returns even if filing solely to claim additional credit, with reporting mandatory if any APTC was received.

Individuals and Families

IRS Issues Guidance on Auto Loan Interest Deduction: On Dec. 31, 2025, the IRS issued proposed regulations regarding the auto loan interest deduction. The rule addresses information reporting requirements for lenders, identifies eligible taxpayers and loans and guidelines for determining final assembly.

Qualifying vehicles must be “new” to the taxpayer (original use starts with the purchase), built mainly for roads and highways (not rails or off-road only), and have their final assembly in the United States, which taxpayers can check via the vehicle’s ID number (VIN) details or the label on the car showing the assembly location. Only individuals, estates of deceased people and certain trusts can claim the deduction, which is subject to phase-out limitations.

Qualifying loans must be taken out after Dec. 31, 2024, secured by a first lien on the qualifying vehicle, and used to buy the car plus typical add-ons like sales tax, registration fees or service plans, but not insurance or “negative equity” from trading in an old car loan. The deduction does not apply to loans to finance boats or trailers. Additionally, deductible interest on refinanced loans are capped at the original loan’s remaining balance. To qualify as “personal use,” the taxpayer must expect to use the financed vehicle for more than half the time for individual, rather than business, purposes.

Lenders receiving more than $600 in interest annually from a qualifying loan must report the details to the IRS and send taxpayers a statement noting that not all interest may be deductible. The lender would be required to file an information return for each borrower, reporting items such as the borrower’s name and address, total interest received, outstanding principal at the start of the year, loan origination date and the vehicle’s VIN, year, make and model. The guidance incorporates existing penalty frameworks for failures to file or furnish required information returns and payee statements.

Public comments on the proposed regulations are due by Feb. 2, 2026, and a public hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 24, 2026.

International

IRS Issues Initial Guidance on OBBBA International Tax Provisions: On Dec. 4, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notices 2025-75, 2025-77 and 2025-78 previewing proposed regulations on the OBBBA international tax transition rules. Notice 2025-75 covers modified subpart F pro rata share rules for CFC dividends paid on or before June 28, 2025. Notice 2025-77 clarifies the 10% foreign tax credit disallowance under section 960(d)(4) for taxes on section 959(a) distributions of section 951A. Notice 2025-78 addresses the new foreign-derived deduction-eligible income regime excluding gains after June 16 outbound sales of intellectual property or depreciable property (adopting the definitions of intangibles under section 367(d)(4), excluding leases and licenses).

IRS Issues Guidance on Foreign-Government Income: On Dec. 12, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued proposed and final regulations under section 892 that update and clarify the treatment of income earned by foreign governments from their U.S. investments. The proposed rules would redefine “commercial activity,” establish new standards for determining government control of entities, and clarify that partnerships are not considered government-controlled even if wholly owned by a sovereign government. The final regulations confirm that income from qualified, government-controlled entities such as foreign pension funds remains eligible for U.S. real-estate tax exemptions.

Real Estate

IRS Issues Penalty Relief Guidance for the Sale of Farmland Property: On Dec. 22, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-03 for penalty relief from estimated tax penalties for taxpayers that make a valid section 1062(a) election related to gain from the sale of qualified farmland to a qualified farmer. Section 1062(a) allows eligible taxpayers to elect to pay the tax attributable to that gain in four equal annual installments instead of in full by the original due date of the return. The notice clarifies that the deferred portion of the tax may be excluded when computing required estimated tax payments for the year of sale and relief applies only if the taxpayer files a return on time, properly makes the election with the required covenant or restriction attached, and complies with all associated requirements.

Retirement

IRS Issues Guidance on Trump Accounts: On Dec. 2, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-68, announcing its intent to issue upcoming regulations on Trump Accounts, a new type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA) for eligible children under 18 established under the OBBBA. The accounts will include a one-time $1,000 federal pilot contribution for U.S. citizen newborns between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. Families or others can contribute up to $5,000 annually. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 tax-free per employee (counting toward the limit), and certain governments and charities may add qualified general contributions.

The IRS also released draft Form 4547 (Trump Account Election(s)) and instructions for electing into the Trump Accounts program for eligible children. Elections for 2026 are expected to be made by filing the new form or through the online portal at trumpaccounts.gov, which is expected to be available by mid-2026.

IRS Issues Guidance on 403(b) Plans: On Dec. 3, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2025-60 announcing the 2025 Required Amendments List (RA List) for qualified 401(a) plans, 403(b) plans and preapproved interim amendments. The guidance sets Dec. 31, 2027, as the general deadline to amend non-governmental plans (later for governmental or union plans). The list has Part A items (RMD rule updates affecting most plans), Part B items (partnership/trust attribution changes under section 414(c) for unusual plans), and no Part C items, The list aligns with SECURE 2.0 deadlines of 2026 through 2029.

These join facilities in Steyr, Austria, Tudela, Spain and Gothenburg, Sweden.

Individual decarbonisation roadmaps have been developed for each of SKF's factories, outlining the emissions reduction trajectory for every site.

The company-wide strategy incorporates specific actions, investments and anticipated improvements, supporting each location with energy efficiency measures and fossil fuel phase-out initiatives.

“By reducing the carbon footprint of our products, we are also enabling our customers to develop sustainable solutions as well as supporting society in the transition to a more sustainable future.”

Six factories creating global impact

The newly acknowledged factories enable SKF to generate positive environmental impact on a global scale, with sites positioned across Malaysia, Mexico, India, Italy and the US.

At these locations, the company has implemented investments in energy efficient technologies, including heat pumps and advanced chillers, delivering energy savings alongside increased production output.

The nine decarbonised facilities collectively represent nearly 20% of SKF's baseline manufacturing emissions, contributing to overall carbon footprint reduction.

Susanne Larsson, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP Finance at SKF, says: “Climate change is a global challenge and this achievement reflects our commitment to climate action and operational excellence.

“By investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and innovative solutions, we are also increasing our own resilience by lowering our energy demand.”

How do the factories fit into SKF’s strategy?

The decarbonised sites support SKF's progression towards its operational decarbonisation goal by 2030.

The company has established a science-based target for achieving net zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2050.

SKF was amongst the first industrial companies to receive goal validation from the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), with sustainability targets aligned to the Paris Agreement's 1.5C objective.

According to the company, its 2030 decarbonisation goal will be reached through energy and material efficiency improvements combined with transitioning to renewable energy sources for operations.

Supply chain optimisation also features in the strategy, particularly through supporting customers in reaching their sustainability objectives.

This approach involves developing products that are lighter, more efficient, longer lasting and repairable, helping to reduce both product footprints and material consumption.

Rob Jenkinson, Net Zero Manager at SKF, says: “Achieving our net zero goal by 2050 is ambitious, but also needed to speed up both innovation and change in society.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c4b8298a1617ae5fa0a7c151fb89ccf4:bc2a208011aae81ebcc9f92ccab13303/a8b10ce15c622160-org.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 10:59:12.519348

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2026/01/6961738b67cae5.77070586.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-10 14:00:11.291784

With several electrolyzer manufacturing companies noting a less-than-ideal environment for production this year, the industry needs some self-introspection.

Hydrogen industry leaders are grappling with a new reality this year

With the unstable global geopolitical landscape that emerged towards the tail end of last year, several market analysts noted that this year will see some troubling trends emerging for electrolyzer manufacturers. Regionalization across the hydrogen market has emerged following years of a global new world order aimed at increasing hydrogen developments.

Consolidation has become an all-too common theme across the hydrogen market over the past few years. While some regions have embraced the potential of the hydrogen sector to deliver vast amounts of clean energy, others have languished in their adoption of the renewable energy market overall, such as the United States, which has been actively rolling back clean energy permits over the past few months.

With a litany of other energy experts noting the substantial stagnation of the hydrogen energy dream, the market will need to reconsider delaying certain projects this year to give the sector some organic recuperation time. Thankfully, the energy market is nothing if not adaptable.

Several electrolyzer manufacturers expect this year to see a dip in sales

Among the world’s top electrolyzer manufacturers, several are reporting some worrying sales expectations for the new year. Thyssenkrupp Nucera, one of the global energy market’s top hydrogen companies, has stated that it expects significantly lower sales this year. It attributes this less-than-ideal sales to the stagnation and delays of financing for hydrogen projects around the world.

The company has forecasted revenues of €500–600 million for the 2026 fiscal year, which is a dramatic dip from last year, which saw upwards of €845 million in electrolyzer sales across the renewable energy market. The company’s CEO, Werner Ponikwar, said that the global hydrogen market has become an exceedingly challenging place to do business, but assured investors and shareholders that the company will stand strong in the face of adversity.

Germany has become the home of the hydrogen market in Europe

Thyssenkrupp Nucera, which is majority-owned by German company Thyssenkrupp AG, has become an essential driver for the hydrogen sector over the past few years. Germany, overall, has been a welcoming destination for the hydrogen market, with a new report stating that Germany produced hydrogen plasma at 20 million ºC.

Despite the uncertainty, hydrogen remains the most viable fuel of tomorrow",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/73-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:57:53.928365

The decline in EV sales does matter, but there are several reasons to believe the company's EV sales will rebound in 2026. Here are a few of them.

The Model Y refresh significantly impacted sales in 2025

Not all Teslas are made equal. In fact, the Tesla story is really a Model Y (midsize SUV) and, to a slightly lesser extent, a Model 3 (sports sedan) story. The Model X (luxury SUV) and Model S (luxury sedan) are bit part players -- a fact that illustrates the desire for affordable EVs.

As such, when Tesla decided to refresh the Y, it was clear that there would be a noisy quarter or two as production shifted to the new Model Y (known as Juniper) and buyers waited for the latest model to be released.

That's precisely what happened, and as you can see below, Tesla had a very weak first and second quarter as a result. For an idea of how essential the Model Y is, industry analysts estimate it's responsible for more than a quarter of total EV sales in the U.S.

Moreover, for those attributing Tesla's EV sales decline in 2025 to its high-profile CEO Elon Musk's political involvements, it's worth noting that, according to Cox Automotive, Model 3 sales rose by 17.6% in the first nine months of 2025 in the U.S. This isn't a Tesla or Musk problem, at least not in the U.S., it's a Model Y problem.

Furthermore, the rollout of the Juniper was phased regionally, as is the issue of newer standard, more affordable versions of the Model Y that Tesla is selling to better compete on price. With an easier comparison to the first half coming up and the Juniper rollout now global, Tesla's Model Y sales are expected to improve in 2026.

Tesla's sales recovered in the second half

In addition to the Model Y's impact, there's also the pull-forward of sales in the U.S. to the third quarter, caused by the expiration of U.S. federal EV tax credits at the end of September. This contributed to the sales increase observed in the third quarter, followed by a decline in the fourth quarter.

But here's the thing. If you annualize the fourth-quarter deliveries, it comes to 1.67 million deliveries. If you annualize the second half (to adjust for the tax credit expiry issue), it comes to 1.83 million deliveries. For reference, Tesla published the Wall Street analyst consensus for deliveries in 2026, which is 1.75 million deliveries, a figure in the middle of the two figures I calculated above.

Robotaxis and lower rates will help, too

The advent of robotaxis, led by regulatory approval and, hopefully, the production of Cybercabs, will highlight a key value-added feature of Tesla EVs. Specifically, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software.

While Tesla's unsupervised robotaxis haven't been approved anywhere yet, Musk believes that regulatory approvals will flow in 2026 (such that Cybercab commercial production is planned to begin in April), and so will European approval of FSD -- Musk believes it will be granted in the Netherlands in early 2026.

These actions will significantly raise the profile of Tesla's FSD solutions and add perceived value to Tesla's EVs. In addition, all vehicle sales will benefit from a lower interest rate environment for investors.

What it means for Tesla investors

While the most critical catalysts for Tesla's stock in 2026 will be the advent of robotaxis, Cybercab production, and ongoing regulatory approvals, a return to growth in EV sales also matters, not least from a narrative perspective, as Tesla's declining EV sales have been a stick for the bears to beat the stock with. In addition, building production volume is a key factor in generating margin expansion and lowering the cost of EV production, ensuring that Tesla can make EVs more affordable.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850074%2Ftesla-sales-building-with-tesla-logo-and-teslas-parked-in-front.png&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-10 07:57:50.236808

Growth Energy’s Ask Enact legislation to permanently allow year-round sales of E15(S.593/H.R.
Passing legislation to allow E15 to be sold year-round would increase availability and save consumers money.","In 1990, Congress specified that fuel with 10% ethanol (E10) could be sold year-round to encourage the use of ethanol-blended fuels, which save consumers money and burn cleaner than fuels without ethanol. However, the waiver Congress granted for E10 predated the introduction of higher ethanol blends like E15. E15 has an even lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) than E10, meaning it has lower evaporative emissions than standard E10 fuel. This means that despite having lower emissions than E10, E15 cannot be sold in most states during the summer months, except temporarily through emergency waivers.

Growth Energy’s Ask

Enact legislation to permanently allow year-round sales of E15(S.593/H.R. 1346, Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act).

As a result of emergency waivers and other EPA regulatory action from 2019-2025, consumers saved upwards of 30 cents per gallon by choosing E15, with some locations offering E15 for over $1 per gallon less than E10.

Passing legislation to allow E15 to be sold year-round would increase availability and save consumers money. If we made E15 the standard fuel in the U.S., we could save $20 billion+ in fuel costs each year.

BIOFUEL BLENDS

Nationwide adoption of E15 would save consumers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs, put an additional $36.3 billion in income into the pockets of American families, and generate $66.3 billion for the U.S. GDP.

Nationwide adoption of E15 will result in an increase in corn demand of about 2.3 billion bushels per year.

E15 and higher biofuel blends have lower evaporative emissions than standard vehicle fuels.

Higher biofuel blends are better for air quality, reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants harmful to human health, like carbon monoxide.

Ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 46% compared to gasoline.

If the United States transitioned from E10 to E15 nationwide, greenhouse gas emissions would fall by 17.62 million tons per year, the equivalent of removing 3.85 million vehicles from the road.

In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California's Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.
""The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.""
""Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk.
That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,"" said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday doubled down on California's commitment to electric vehicles with proposed rebates intended to backfill federal tax credits canceled by the Trump administration.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles. It was part of a sweeping $348.9-billion state budget proposal released Friday, which also included items to address air pollution and worsening wildfires, amid a projected $3-billion state deficit.

EVs have become a flashpoint in California's battle against the Trump administration, which moved last year to repeal the state's long-held authority to set strict tailpipe emission standards and eventually ban the sale of new gas powered cars.

Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California's Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.

""Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California's world leading climate agenda,"" Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. ""This incentive program will help continue the state's ZEV momentum, especially with the federal administration eliminating the federal EV tax credit and carpool lane access.""

Newsom had previously flip-flopped on this idea, first vowing to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars and then walking it back in September. That same month, a group of five automakers including Honda, Rivian, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Audi wrote a letter urging Newsom and state legislators to establish a $5,000 EV tax rebate to replace the lost federal incentives, Politico reported.

During his State of the State speech Thursday — one year after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles — Newsom said California ""refuse[s] to be bystanders"" while China and other nations take the lead on electric vehicles and the clean energy transition. He touted the state's investments in solar, hydrogen, wind and nuclear power, as well as its recent move away from the use of any coal-fired power.

""We must continue our prudent fiscal management, funding our reserves, and continuing the investments Californians rely on, from education to public safety, all while preparing for Trump's volatility outside our control,"" the governor said in a statement. ""This is what responsible governance looks like.""

Several environmental groups had been urging Newsom to invest more in clean air and clean vehicle programs, which they say are critical to the state's ambitious goals for human health and the environment. Transportation is the largest source of climate and air pollution in California and is responsible for more than a third of global warming emissions, said Daniel Barad, Western states policy manager with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

""As federal attacks threaten California's authority to protect public health, incentives are more essential than ever to scale up clean cars and trucks,"" Barad said. ""The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.""

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California senior director with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, called it ""an essential step to save money for Californians, cut harmful pollution, spur innovation, and support the global competitiveness of our auto industry.""

While the budget proposal does not include significant new spending proposals, it contains other line items relating to climate and the environment. Among them are plans to continue implementing Proposition 4, the $10-billion climate bond approved by voters in 2024 for programs geared toward wildfire resilience, safe drinking water, flood management, extreme heat mitigation and other similar efforts.

Among $2.1 billion in climate bond investments proposed this year are $58 million for wildfire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects in vulnerable communities, and nearly $20 million to assist homeowners with defensible space to prevent fire. Water-related investments include $232 million for flood control projects and nearly $70 million to support repairs to existing or new water conveyance projects.

The proposal also lays out how to spend money from California's signature cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions. State lawmakers last year voted to extend the program through 2045 and rename it cap-and-invest.

The spending plan includes a new tiered structure for cap-and-invest that first funds statutory obligations such as manufacturing tax exemptions, followed by $1 billion for the high speed rail project, $750 million to support the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and finally secondary program funding such as affordable housing and low-carbon transit options.

But while some groups applauded the budget's broad handling of climate issues, others criticized it for leaning too heavily on volatile funding sources for environmental priorities, such as special funds and one-time allocations.

The Sierra Club called the EV incentive program a crucial investment but said too many other items were left with ""patchwork strategies that make long-term planning harder.""

""Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk. That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,"" said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.

California Environmental Voters, meanwhile, stressed that the state should continue to work toward legislation that would hold oil and gas companies liable for damages caused by their emissions — a plan known as ""Make Polluters Pay"" that stalled last year amid fierce lobbying and industry pressure.

""Instead of asking families to absorb the costs, the Legislature must look seriously at holding polluters accountable for the harm they’ve caused,"" said Shannon Olivieri Hovis, California Environmental Voters' chief strategy officer.

Sarah Swig, Newsom's senior advisor for climate, noted that the state's budget plan came just days after Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major global treaty signed by nearly 200 countries with the aim of addressing global warming through coordinated international action.

""California is not slowing down on climate at a time when we continue to see attack after attack from the federal government, including as recently as this week with the Trump administration's withdrawal from the UNFCCC,"" Swig told reporters Friday. ""California's leadership has never mattered more.""",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/la_times_articles_853/160eef23583183e08a649043fc1a29cf,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:11.313906

Darnell Tingle,,,,,https://www.bnd.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article314249484.html,"Pritzker start 2026 off right by passing a major bill to help lower electricity bills in the Metro East and across Illinois.

It will lower costs for our struggling neighbors, create opportunities for workers and aspiring clean energy entrepreneurs, shepherd in a new era of environmental justice, and deliver on the promises our state made with previous clean energy legislation.","With everyday costs skyrocketing throughout 2025, from groceries to health insurance to holiday gifts, I was happy to see Gov. Pritzker start 2026 off right by passing a major bill to help lower electricity bills in the Metro East and across Illinois.

After Ameren bills spiked as much as $200 per month in our community this year, I joined many other voices from across Illinois to call for lawmakers to ease the burden on people’s wallets. In response, Gov. Pritzker has signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, which will lower Ameren bills by more than $20 per month by 2035.

My colleagues and I at United Congregations of Metro-East (UCM) were incredibly happy to see the General Assembly and Gov. Pritzker enact a solution that addresses the ongoing affordability crisis while also creating jobs in our community and protecting our environment. As an organization committed to social justice and climate action, UCM is incredibly proud to operate in a state that is building a strong, more equitable economy through clean energy.

CRGA is built upon the strong foundation laid by Illinois’ previous landmark climate and jobs bills, including 2017’s Future Energy and Jobs Act (FEJA) and 2021’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). FEJA kickstarted Illinois’ clean energy economy, and CEJA made sure its benefits were extended to communities often left out of the conversation.

CEJA has been incredibly valuable for the communities we, and other organizations like ours, serve. In fact, UCM was one of the many community advocacy organizations that gave underrepresented communities a seat at the table during negotiations over CEJA.

Our successful lobbying efforts led CEJA to institute nation-leading equity standards, ensuring jobs and clean energy projects benefit people from disadvantaged backgrounds – whether based on income level, prior incarceration, environmental issues in a community, racial disparities, or other factors that have historically excluded certain people from the clean energy economy.

We at UCM have witnessed firsthand the benefits of CEJA’s equity standards, as we are one of the state’s designated organizations responsible for helping people access CEJA’s workforce opportunities. Through our involvement with CEJA, we have helped numerous individuals put themselves on a path to a high-quality career in a fast-growing field.

The latest bill, CRGA, retains all of CEJA’s equity targets and will be critical in ensuring Illinois meets those marks, thanks to its continued support of programs that provide families access to clean energy and promote growth for small, diverse businesses across Illinois.

Equally important as the economic benefits, environmental preservation and remediation is a core tenet of Illinois’ energy policy. The Metro East region is second only to Chicagoland when it comes to the number of officially designated Environmental Justice Communities. Our area has long been disproportionately impacted by environmental racism; a 100% renewable energy grid will begin to roll back the horrific legacy of industrial pollution that plagues minority and low-income neighborhoods.

CRGA will make the goal of a carbon-free future a reality by investing in energy storage – a technology that absorbs excess solar and wind energy to use later, keeping our grid clean even when the sun is down or the wind isn’t blowing.

In addition to its environmental benefits, storage is proven to save money; for example, storage saved Texas residents $750 million since 2023, and CRGA is projected to save more than $12 billion over the next 20 years. CRGA’s storage program will also create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development in our state – with an intentional focus on benefiting the communities that most need it.

It’s not often that new legislation offers a win for every party involved, but CRGA has accomplished this for organizations like UCM and the communities we serve. It will lower costs for our struggling neighbors, create opportunities for workers and aspiring clean energy entrepreneurs, shepherd in a new era of environmental justice, and deliver on the promises our state made with previous clean energy legislation.

EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is calling on Ottawa to further speed up its approval process for major projects, saying she wants to see applications green-lit within six months.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's major projects office, established last year, currently aims to complete regulatory reviews within two years.

Smith, in a letter to Carney shared on social media Friday, said that two years is too long, considering the recent U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to ramp up oil production in the South American country.

""Renewed Venezuelan crude production, supported by United States investment, will ultimately increase the amount of heavy oil bound for U.S. refineries and directly compete with Canadian production for limited refining capacity,"" Smith said in the letter.

The premier, who said she had a ""positive"" meeting with Carney on Friday discussing the developments in Venezuela, has previously said Maduro's capture underscored the need for new pipelines, including one to the West Coast being pitched and planned by her government.

Smith's letter says an application for such a pipeline will be submitted by June, and asks that it be approved no later than fall.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for an even quicker approval of Alberta's desired pipeline, saying Ottawa should sign off on it within 60 days of receiving the application.

A route for the pipeline and a private-sector proponent have yet to be determined.

Smith said in her letter that ""within the current geopolitical context, timelines of up to two years are still woefully long"" and put Canada at risk, especially since the U.S. is accelerating its own oil and gas projects.

""Any delay risks ceding market share, losing investment, and undermining Canada's competitive position in a rapidly changing global energy landscape.""

Trump met with executives from 17 major oil companies Friday, saying he expected at least US$100 billion in investments to expand oil production in Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves in the world.

The president also promised ""government protection"" for those investments, saying the U.S. was able to work with Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, and that the companies would be dealing with his administration directly when it comes to oil production.

Smith's letter says there is proven demand for Alberta's heavy oil in Asia and that a new pipeline — and an expansion of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline connecting her province to the B.C. tidewater — would secure further investments and stabilize oil prices, which make or break her government's budgets.

""As a stable democracy with some of the most modern, efficient and lowest emissions intensity oil produced globally, Canada is uniquely positioned to significantly expand its role in global energy markets,"" Smith wrote.

""The federal government must act with urgency to seize this opportunity, safeguard long-term economic security, and secure our energy future.""

Later Friday, Carney said on social media he and Smith talked about getting ""big things built"" for Albertans and Canadians, but didn't address the premier's call for quicker approvals.

Questions sent to Carney's office about Smith's call for quicker project approvals were forwarded to a spokesperson for Energy Minister Tim Hodgson.

Charlotte Power, Hodgson's press secretary, said the government was working with Alberta to make sure the approval process for a bitumen pipeline was ""clear and efficient.""

""When it comes to specific timelines, we are still in early stages but look forward to engaging with Alberta, B.C. and Indigenous communities further,"" she said Friday in a statement.

Carney said earlier this week he thought Canada's oil would remain competitive, despite the removal of Maduro, because it is low risk and low cost.

Power said the government continues to monitor developments, but added that it's ""too early to speculate on the impacts on Canada’s oil industry.""

""Regardless of any potential long-term impacts, our government is taking bold action to transform our economy and energy industry into one that is diverse, independent and resilient to global shocks.""

The firm will announce final results on January 29.

Seoul-based LGES, a supplier to automakers including Tesla and General Motors, is grappling with weaker demand for battery-powered vehicles and US President Donald Trump's policy ‌changes on ‍green energy.

General Motors said on Thursday it would ‍take a $6 billion writedown on some EV investments, the ‌latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and cooling demand.

Last month, LGES reported that a battery contract worth 9.6 trillion won with Ford has been cancelled after Ford slashed its outlook for the EV market, followed by another cancellation with Freudenberg Battery Power Systems worth 3.9 trillion won.

LGES plans ‍to sell some factory assets in the United States to Japanese carmaker Honda Motor, citing the need to improve business ‍efficiency.

The company ⁠may soon announce the ⁠suspension of operations at its plant jointly run with GM in the United States, which would cause at least 1 trillion won in temporary cost, according to a January 2 note from Seoul-based NH Investment & Securities.

GM said in October it would halt battery cell production at its two US joint-venture battery plants with LGES - in Tennessee and Ohio - in January for about six months.

Three environmental organizations sent a December 22nd letter to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) styled:

Notice of Violation of Affirmative Disclosure Duty, Request for Records of Final Individual Permits under § 404.

The three environmental organizations included:

Center for Biological Diversity

(Collectively, “CBD”).

The letter was transmitted to the “FOIA Officer.”

The letter states that it is serving to notify the Corps:

… of its ongoing violation of its duty to proactively disclose information under the “reading room” provisions of the Freedom of Information Act1 (“FOIA”) and to request that the Corps immediately correct these violations by making publicly available through an online portal all final permitting decisions and associated documents issued pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

CBD states that the Corps is required under the FOIA’s “reading room” provisions to make available for public inspection in an electronic format records of all standard individual permits granted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as well as amendments thereto and certain associated approval documents. It further alleges that such records are required to be available as soon as a final permit or permit modification is issued by a District Engineer.

The Corps is alleged to, upon issuing such permits, be failing to proactively disclose permitting decisions on the associated records documenting the decisions.

CBD acknowledges the Corps’ decentralized structure for granting permits. It further acknowledges that some Districts may publish these records as required but the three organizations and the broader public are stated to have no ability to review records from key Districts even:

New Delhi, January 9, 2026: The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) today released a landmark report titled, “India’s PV Manufacturing & Its Strategic Inflection Points” at the Bharat Climate Forum (BCF) 2026, held at ITC Maurya, New Delhi. The report was unveiled during the formal launch of India’s National Cleantech Manufacturing Implementation Plan, in the presence of senior government leaders, global institutions, industry, and finance stakeholders.

The release took place during a dedicated session in the evening, with Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, present at the launch. The report provides a strategic assessment of India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing ecosystem and outlines policy, financing, and industrial interventions required to strengthen India’s global competitiveness across the value chain. About the report, Dr Dhawan said, “TERI’s landmark macro-level study, Reassessment of Solar Potential in India, points to a horizon of unparalleled abundance: an aggregate solar potential exceeding 10,800 GW, spanning multiple modalities including ground-mounted, rooftop, and other emerging deployment pathways. This abundance changes the strategic question in front of us. When a country has this scale of clean energy opportunity, the issue is no longer whether we can deploy enough solar. The real question is whether we will capture enough value at home through manufacturing, technology, skills, and resilient supply chains, while keeping electricity affordable for households and industry.”

While formally launching the report, Shri Santosh Sarangi, Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, highlighted the need to strengthen India’s renewable energy ecosystem and scale clean energy deployment, stating, “India’s renewable energy journey over the last decade has been nothing short of spectacular, marked by phenomenal leapfrogging in global rankings. Our strategy has been defined by a single-minded national objective pursued across three clear verticals: accelerating RE deployment, achieving Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in manufacturing, and driving higher citizen adoption. Through a strategic combination of policy initiatives and trade instruments, we have scaled our solar capacity from a mere 2.63 GW in 2014 to over 134 GW today. This transition is not just about capacity; it is about building a resilient, self-sufficient ecosystem that serves as a blueprint for global energy shifts.”

The report notes that while India has built significant strength in module manufacturing, with domestic module capacity far exceeding current annual demand, critical vulnerabilities persist upstream. India continues to import nearly all of its polysilicon and the vast majority of wafers, creating risks that could constrain future solar deployment if upstream capacity is not established in time.

According to the study, tool chains and manufacturing equipment are emerging as a key chokepoint, with a heavy reliance on imported high-end furnaces, deposition tools, and precision equipment. Without focused incentives for domestic equipment manufacturing and accelerated R&D, these dependencies could expose India’s solar sector to supply-chain disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, and geopolitical risks.

The report underscores that access to affordable, blended finance will be decisive in enabling large-scale upstream investments. It highlights the role of sovereign “Green-PV” bonds, co-equity participation by national investment institutions, concessional debt from development finance institutions, and risk-mitigation instruments in reducing the cost of capital and improving the bankability of upstream fabs.

The study further recommends the development of Solar–Semicon Technology Parks, shared pilot fabs for next-generation technologies, and a dedicated PV–Semicon Skill Council to strengthen innovation pipelines and workforce readiness, with a particular emphasis on linking incentives to skilling outcomes and greater participation of women in manufacturing.

The report release formed part of a broader set of high-level discussions at BCF 2026, which featured addresses by Shri C P Radhakrishnan, Hon’ble Vice-President of India, Union Ministers, and global leaders, positioning climate action, cleantech manufacturing, and resilience as central pillars of India’s growth strategy. On India’s cleantech manufacturing vision and the role of domestic manufacturing in strengthening climate and economic resilience, the Hon’ble Minister said, “A developed India cannot be built on imported technologies, fragile supply chains, or outdated energy systems alone. It must be built on homegrown clean technologies, resilient manufacturing, and a future-ready workforce”.

The Bharat Climate Forum brought together senior policymakers, global leaders, and experts from institutions including the United Nations, World Bank Group, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asian Development Bank, International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, NABARD, State Bank of India, and leading private sector and financial institutions.

Throughout the day-long plenary, discussions focused on clean energy transition, climate-resilient growth, cleantech manufacturing, long-term climate finance, digital and green convergence, and governance reforms needed to deliver a green, resilient, and Viksit Bharat.

Union Ministers addressed key priorities for India’s climate and development agenda, highlighting policy direction, implementation pathways, and the role of finance and industry in accelerating the transition. Regarding India’s power, housing, and urban transition priorities and their role in driving low-carbon growth, Shri Manohar Lal Khattar, the Hon’ble Union Minister for Power, Housing and Urban Affairs said, “India has rapidly transitioned towards clean energy. Non-fossil fuel sources now account for over 51.5% of our total installed capacity, achieved five years ahead of our 2030 target. Since 2014, we have added 178 GW of renewable energy, and our solar capacity has grown nearly 47 times from 2.83 GW to 133 GW, making India the world’s third-largest producer of solar power”.

The Forum also featured a valedictory ministerial address reflecting on India’s leadership role in global climate action and the importance of aligning national ambition with international collaboration.",https://www.teriin.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/Bharat-Climate-Forum-1.JPG,N,,2026-01-10 07:58:01.313657

The stubborn persistence of partisan politics aside, the vehicle electrification movement faces significant structural obstacles. Chief among them are the high costs of installing fast-charging stations, and an aging, creaky, bottleneck-y grid that can’t support fast-charging technology in many locations. Not to worry. The EV charging station environment is getting a quick pick-me-up in the form of AI-assisted charging-plus-storage systems, as capably illustrated by the California startup ElectricFish.

EV Charging In The USA: Where Have All The EVs Gone?

The launch of new EV charging technology into the US market comes at a fraught time for decarbonization advocates. As anticipated, domestic EV sales crashed in the months following the premature death of the federal EV tax credit on September 30 of 2025, and the outlook for 2026 doesn’t look rosy, either.

Still, EV sales did not totally evaporate, and some automakers are still planning to elbow new EVs into the gap left by industry leader Tesla’s ongoing nosedive, including Toyota and Ford along with newcomer Telo Trucks and the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto. Together, they lend support to the idea that investing in the the nation’s EV charging network is still a worthwhile proposition.

In addition, while loss of the tax credit may discourage current EV owners from buying another EV, the fact is that the horses have already run out of the barn. More than 4 million EVs are currently on the road in the US, and that’s no small potatoes. Chances are that some — if not most — of those drivers will stick with an EV when they need another car, further supporting investments in new charging stations. Sales of plug-in hybrids, including range-extended options like those offered by the Scout Motors branch of Volkswagen, will also support the demand for more convenient, more accessible charging stations.

The ElectricFish Solution: Go For The Gas Stations

Into this scenario jumps ElectricFish with an economical EV charging station solution that works around grid bottlenecks, with a particular focus on enabling traditional gas stations to incorporate EV charging into their business model.

“Gas stations are built for short dwell times and high turnover. We designed our new service to behave like a pump, not a parking space,” emphasizes ElectricFish CEO and co-founder Anurag Kamal.

ElectricFish first floated across the CleanTechnica radar in March of 2025 with the official launch of its new “350Squared” charging station, for which it claimed a savings of 90% of the cost of grid upgrades needed for conventional fast-charging stations, achieved by eliminating new trenches and other infrastructure expenses. The containerized system can also be picked up and moved with a minimum of complications, if needed.

“ElectricFish’s chief contribution is ‘350Squared,’ a modular, plug-and-play charging station that can deploy existing 200-amp electrical infrastructure to pull double duty as a community microgrid and energy storage facility, providing backup power in case of emergency,” CleanTechnica observed. The ultra-fast charging system includes 400 kilowatt-hours of storage, enabling it to recharge itself slowly while delivering a quick charge to EV drivers in a hurry.

In the latest news from ElectricFish, the company unveiled its new “400Squared” charging station solution at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this week, providing CleanTechnica with additional details by email (the info is also available here).

Convenience is front and center in ElectricFish’s business model. The idea is to provide EV drivers with a quick, 8–10 minute top-off at any nearby gas station, pumping up to 180 miles of range into their batteries while a revenue-sharing model relieves property owners from upfront installation costs.

“Conventional fast charger installations require utility upgrades that can run north of $150,000 per port and take 12–18+ months to complete,” ElectricFish notes.

“The grid can’t keep pace with EV adoption — and legacy DC fast charging makes the problem worse,” the company adds. “Each new installation adds massive peak demand to already strained infrastructure, deepening the very constraint holding EV infrastructure back. The harder the industry pushes, the more the grid pushes back.”

With the storage element and energy management software, ElectricFish states that it can provide 400-kilowatt charging from a 30-kilowatt grid connection, or even less than 30 kilowatts in some cases. The installation can be completed in 4–6 weeks, a sharp contrast with the 12–18 months typical of conventional fast-charging stations.

“We don’t sell EV chargers or batteries; we sell time and uptime. We’ve decoupled charging speed from grid limits by actively managing when energy flows in or out, so fast charging strengthens the grid instead of destabilizing it,” explains ElectricFish CTO and co-founder Nelio Batista.

More EV Charging Stations For More EVs

The ElectricFish solution has already earned a big thumbs-up from Hyundai, which put the system through its paces at its California Proving Ground in the heat of the summer in 2025. “We see this as a way to unlock fast charging at sites that the grid alone can’t support today,” reported Hyundai Senior Engineer Dean Vivo Amore.

Toyota is also onboard. ElectricFish also notes that the Toyota Mobility Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Challenge was instrumental in its most recent commercial deployment, located at the Eastern Market food and warehouse hub in Detroit.

ElectricFish is just one of among a number of new charging-plus-storage innovators to anticipate that today’s dismal environment for EV sales is a passing blip along the way to a decarbonized future.

Another up-and-comer to watch is the Seattle firm ElectricEra, which is pitching its fast-charging technology to the convenience store market. The company unveiled its new, trademarked “RetailEdge” charging station at the National Association of Convenience Stores in October. The company is focusing attention on sleek styling, by way of encouraging property owners to position their EV chargers front and center rather than hiding them in the back of the lot, while also enabling retailers to squeeze more value from the addition of new charging stations.

“RetailEdge Experiences unlocks the full value of the EV charge kiosk’s premium touchscreen by allowing retailers to configure the screen to deliver loyalty program signups, membership validation, retail media campaigns — and even conduct retail transactions by linking with point-of-sale systems,” ElectricEra explained.

Without the need for significant new electricity infrastructure, ElectricEra reports a 54-day installation timeline for its 400-kilowatt charging stations. To further grease the EV sales wheels, the company is also pitching its “HaloAI” assistant, which can guide drivers through the EV charging process.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-10.33.25-AM.png,N,,2026-01-10 09:59:10.250836

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bffed1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F40%2Fc4%2F98bc022db674e0cbbe52109ebe9e%2F56a05b2cb00c426cb5f12412b46e1cbd,N,,2026-01-10 05:58:28.105170

“Caveat emptor.” Buyer beware. Property managers who hire contractors and maintenance professionals to work on residential properties (and some commercial properties) built before 1978 should heed this warning, given the recent tightening and enforcement of federal regulations regarding lead-based paint.

In January 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency tightened its standards under the “Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule” to protect individuals from hazards posed by lead-based paint, but delayed enforcement of penalties until Jan. 12, 2026, one year after the rule change took effect. Property managers who engage in renovation and repair of residential properties on behalf of the owner and fail to comply with the updated standard could face costly lawsuits, project shutdowns, future insurance denial and fines of up to $40,000 per violation.

“The vast majority of small property managers are not tracking EPA updates, and levied fines can be business-killers,” says Troy Garrett, CEO of the National Association of Residential Property Managers. “The EPA does not communicate with practitioners or investors about rule changes. Without a clear understanding of the rules, non-compliance can drive both small investors and property managers out of the market,” says Garrett.

The RRP Rule also applies to pre-1978 commercial properties where children are routinely present, such as schools, daycare centers and healthcare facilities. Although lead-based paint was banned for consumer use in the U.S. in 1978, it remains in millions of structures.

Lead poisoning cases have significantly declined since the 1970s; however, exposure via old pipes, paint and ceramics is still considered especially dangerous for children under age 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Even very low blood lead levels have been shown to reduce a child’s IQ and academic performance.

Significantly Lower Dust-Lead Hazard and Clearance Levels

The rule change lowers the dust-lead hazard standards to “any reportable level” as analyzed by an EPA-recognized laboratory. Additionally, it lowers post-abatement dust-lead clearance levels to between 50% and 75% of the previous levels for floors, window sills and troughs. The most common source of lead exposure in the body is inhaling or ingesting microscopic dust, often associated with property renovations and repairs.

Renovation and repair work that disturbs more than 6 square feet of lead paint (think window replacement, interior remodeling or surface preparation for painting) must be performed by a Lead-Safe Certified firm, with at least one worker on the job site who is Renovator-Certified by the EPA or an EPA-authorized program. The fee for most firms is $300 every five years, equivalent to a cost of $60 per year.

The EPA estimates that renovator-certified training, which is also valid for five years, costs $562 per person trained, including tuition, value of time for the eight hours the renovator is in class, travel and lunch.

The certification requirement applies to property managers who maintain in-house contractors. Firms that outsource renovation, repair and painting are responsible for confirming whether a contractor is Lead-Safe Certified and should ask to see a copy of the EPA training certificate.

NARPM advises its members to contact their state EPA office to understand how officials will enforce the new regulations in their state. “Some offices work to help property managers do the right thing to care for the health and safety of tenants, while others are more aggressive or even predatory in nature about compliance,” says Garrett.

The EPA has authorized 16 states to operate their own training and certification programs. If you manage property in multiple states, you may need to pursue multiple certifications.

Often called “white gold”, lithium is the backbone of electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, smartphones, and even data centers that support blockchain networks. Today, the eyes of America and China are firmly fixed on lithium, and the competition is intensifying.

China currently dominates much of the global lithium supply chain — from mining and refining to battery manufacturing. This dominance gives China a significant advantage in electric vehicles and clean energy technologies. In response, the United States is aggressively pushing to secure alternative lithium sources through domestic mining, strategic partnerships, and investments in South America, Australia, and Africa.

Why does this matter beyond traditional markets? Because energy security is now digital security. Bitcoin mining, AI infrastructure, and Web3 ecosystems all rely on stable energy systems and advanced batteries. As lithium demand grows, its price, supply constraints, and geopolitical control could indirectly influence the cost of energy-intensive technologies, including crypto mining and blockchain infrastructure.

This resource rivalry also opens doors for investors. Companies involved in lithium mining, battery technology, and energy innovation are gaining attention. At the same time, crypto narratives around energy efficiency, green mining, and sustainable blockchains are becoming more relevant than ever.

Lithium is no longer just a commodity — it is a geopolitical weapon, an economic driver, and a technological cornerstone. As America and China continue their strategic tug-of-war, the ripple effects will cross global markets, clean energy transitions, and even the future of decentralized technology.

If Colorado declines to write a new plan, the EPA could impose one on the state.
“You do not have to shut these down to ensure the people in Colorado have clean air,” he said.
The Trump administration is intent on keeping the state’s coal plants burning through other means.
Ulla Reeves, the National Park Conservation Association’s clean air program director, previously told The Denver Post that the agency is undercutting Colorado’s progress to clean its air.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday determined Colorado cannot order the closure of coal-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act, and, therefore, the agency will deny the state’s plan to reduce the haze that clouds views at Rocky Mountain National Park and other federal lands.

The move is part of the Trump administration’s push to make sure no federal regulations stand in the way of restoring the coal industry and powering the electric grid with the fossil fuel, which pollutes the air with carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, soot and other chemicals that contribute to climate change and harm human health.

Those coal emissions also help create a haze that dims visibility for people experiencing the outdoors, something that is important to Colorado’s economy and state identity. Colorado is required to find ways to reduce that haze under the Clean Air Act. To do so, the state had proposed shuttering coal plants — a move that would also help meet its goal to eliminate almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The EPA signaled in July that it would at least partially deny Colorado’s plan to reduce haze, but on Friday, it kicked the entire strategy back to the state for a rewrite. If Colorado declines to write a new plan, the EPA could impose one on the state.

Cyrus Western, administrator for EPA Region 8, which includes Colorado, said the state cannot shut down coal-fired power plants without consent from the utilities that run them, and, therefore, the mandate does not comply with the Clean Air Act.

Because Colorado Springs Utilities wants to exclude its Ray D. Nixon Power Plant in Fountain from the state’s closure plans, the EPA rejected Colorado’s entire plan, he said.

The plants are vital to supplying reliable and affordable electricity, and Colorado can still meet its requirements to reduce haze while keeping them open, Western said.

“You do not have to shut these down to ensure the people in Colorado have clean air,” he said.

Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an emailed statement that the EPA’s decision will negatively impact Colorado’s environment and the “majestic national parks and wilderness areas the program was designed to safeguard.”

The state’s Air Pollution Control Division will review the EPA’s decision and consider its next step, he said, noting that the state had not failed to meet its regional haze requirements.

“Regardless of EPA’s decision, Colorado will continue to lead,” Ogletree said. “Coal plant retirement dates remain in state regulation, and many facilities have already closed or are on track to retire voluntarily because cleaner energy is more affordable and makes economic sense for consumers. Colorado has demonstrated that it is possible to protect public health, reduce pollution and maintain a reliable energy system at the same time.”

Environmentalists disagreed with Western’s assessment that Colorado can improve its mountain views while continuing to burn coal.

Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the EPA is mistaken in its decision because Colorado had submitted a “landmark proposal” that would have benefited the state’s open spaces, air quality and residents who need to breathe clean air.

He said Western “is going to lie through his teeth and deny science.”

“It’s beyond crooked how brazen they are in doing the bidding of the coal industry,” Nichols said. “Obviously, a war has been declared against Colorado by the Trump administration and this is another continuation of it.”

Most utilities in the state have plans in place to retire their coal-burning plants and to transition to cleaner power sources such as solar, wind, batteries and natural gas.

However, Colorado Springs Utilities told the Trump administration in 2025 that it needs to keep the Nixon plant open past its 2029 retirement date because its management is having difficulties finding resources for the transition to renewable energy.

Xcel Energy last year received permission from the state to keep one of its coal-burning plants open longer because it needs to repair another, larger plant that is scheduled to close in 2030.

The EPA will assist Colorado in creating a regional haze plan that fulfills all statutory requirements, the agency said in a news release.

Western said it was Colorado’s business if it wants to mandate coal plant closures through state law, but the federal government would not allow the state to use the Clean Air Act as an option for doing so.

The Trump administration is intent on keeping the state’s coal plants burning through other means.

On Dec. 30, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in Craig operating even though it is broken, out of operation and was scheduled to be retired at the end of 2025. The order left Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association in a bind as it tries to figure out how to comply with the order and restart a broken, 45-year-old plant.

Environmentalists and park conservationists oppose the EPA’s plan to support the coal industry.

Ulla Reeves, the National Park Conservation Association’s clean air program director, previously told The Denver Post that the agency is undercutting Colorado’s progress to clean its air.

“Colorado had one of the strongest plans that we’ve seen in the entire country,” Reeves said. “This is really turning that progress backwards. It’s extremely concerning what the EPA is doing here and undercutting the state’s authority.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Climate_Coal_Town_Transition_91724.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-10 00:58:53.747781

While the Mississippi River Ship Channel has seen plenty wins of late, challenges remain.
“The Big River Coalition remains concerned about these changes to the system and believes that resilient ports depend upon resilient waterways,” Duffy said.
“I embrace the opportunity to represent the ‘With You’ leadership team of Big River Coalition LLC while allowing commerce on the Mississippi River to speak with a unified voice and with a strong navigation accent,” Duffy said.
A newly launched Big River Coalition LLC website is forthcoming.","The Big River Coalition, formed in 2010 as a non-profit trade association under the umbrella of the New Orleans Steamship Association (also known as the Louisiana Maritime Association, or LAMA), has spent the past 15 years promoting the economic and navigational interests of the Mississippi River Ship Channel—and to great effect.

The organization’s founding purpose was to address a funding shortfall at the time in the Corps of Engineers’ budget for maintaining the Mississippi River Ship Channel, which extends from Baton Rouge, La., to the Gulf. Sean Duffy Sr., who began serving as the organization’s executive director in 2011, later helped lead the effort to deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel from 45 feet to 50 feet. Work to deepen the ship channel got underway in 2020, with the deeper channel certified from the Gulf to above New Orleans just two years later.

The new year ushered in a noteworthy change for the organization, Duffy has announced. Effective January 1, Big River Coalition transitioned to an independent limited liability corporation, with Duffy now serving as president and CEO.

“This was a mutual decision between the leadership of the Louisiana Maritime Association and me,” Duffy said. “For the last 15 years, every success of the Coalition has been made on behalf of and shared with the Louisiana Maritime Association. I have enjoyed the full support of LAMA and Capt. Ron Branch, but in becoming an independent LLC, I simply wanted more accountability for expanding the Big River Coalition’s efforts to promote, advocate and maintain the Mississippi River Ship Channel.”

Duffy’s strength has always been acting as a waterways polyglot, speaking the languages of a diverse set of waterway stakeholders, from shippers and pilots to dredgers, government agencies, engineers, civic groups and port officials.

“In many ways, I serve as a translator between government agencies and the navigation industry to deal with things like dredge restrictions, dredge placement areas, revetment restrictions, etc.,” Duffy said. “I’m a team guy, and I’ve always said that waterways management is a team sport.”

To that end, Duffy said that, under the Big River Coalition LLC banner, he will continue to represent “Team Mississippi River” in conference rooms, emergency operations centers, the halls of Congress and anywhere in between.

While the Mississippi River Ship Channel has seen plenty wins of late, challenges remain. One challenge involves extending the 50-foot channel upriver beyond Mile 180.

“Deepening above Mile 180 will be a challenge due to a number of required pipeline relocations and the need to adjust the U.S. Coast Guard’s aids to navigation in order to accommodate the Corps’ plan to realign the ship channel in certain locations,” Duffy said.

Another challenge that Duffy frequently highlights is “climate variability.” High water seasons, like those between 2018 and 2020, and low water periods, seen each year from 2022 to 2025, present challenges for navigation and the sustainability of the river itself. Duffy frequently has raised an alarm on instability along the east bank of the river below Bohemia, La., comparing that stretch of the river to a “leaky garden hose.” Decreased flow along that stretch promotes siltation and saltwater intrusion, which seasonally threatens fresh-water intakes for communities and industry up to New Orleans. Conversely, high-water periods increase flows through crevasses on the east bank of the river and threaten to further erode the main channel.

“The Big River Coalition remains concerned about these changes to the system and believes that resilient ports depend upon resilient waterways,” Duffy said. “A personal concern is the need for more proactive deltaic riverine management focused, not only on flood control and navigation, but also on protecting the drinking water supply along the Big River from New Orleans to the Gulf of America.”

Regardless of the challenge or opportunity, Duffy said the mission of Big River Coalition LLC remains the same.

“I embrace the opportunity to represent the ‘With You’ leadership team of Big River Coalition LLC while allowing commerce on the Mississippi River to speak with a unified voice and with a strong navigation accent,” Duffy said.

A newly launched Big River Coalition LLC website is forthcoming. In the meantime, people can reach Duffy through his LinkedIn account. Search for “Sean M. Duffy Sr.”

The EV tax credit ended in September.
GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2026/01/696173cc089318.64375727.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-11 16:58:36.078634

There are steps that governments — and companies — can take to reduce negative data center impacts for residents, which can include increased energy costs and significant water usage.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that xAI is locating a data center in Southaven — the latest project in a nationwide trend of data center expansion — and the company is approved for the state’s Data Center Incentive, which provides a sales and use tax exemption on computing and equipment software for eligible data centers. The company, per the announcement, will create hundreds of permanent jobs, retrofit the building that is housing its operations and provide tax revenue for the city of Southaven.

Companies often tout job creation as a benefit of data centers, but some public officials have argued that data center jobs are not always what a community needs, as was the case with a Tucson, Ariz., data center project. The project promised to create 180 jobs, but residents voiced opposition over water and energy concerns.

Tucson Council Member Lane Santa Cruz said during an August City Council study session that construction jobs to support data center builds are temporary, underlining that data centers require “very few” long-term employees. The data center project in question, Project Blue, would not bring the jobs the community needed, she said.

“The jobs that data centers do create locally are typically low-wage, term-limited, non-technical positions such as security, maintenance and janitorial work,” according to research from the University of Michigan.

The decision to approve these data centers are happening largely at the government level, and are sometimes shrouded in secrecy involving non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), giving members of the public little say in if and how these builds will progress.

Job creation claims and community benefits touted vary based on project and location.

When Google announced its $1.7 billion plan to expand three data center sites in Ohio, it promised thousands of jobs. However, while about 1,200 jobs were expected to be created at each facility during construction, it was unclear at the time exactly how many permanent jobs would be created — although one Google official estimated permanent staff would be around 200 employees, as reported by Ohio Capital Journal.

Pennsylvania’s $20 billion investment from Amazon for data centers claimed it would create at least 1,250 jobs — notably, high-paying roles like data center engineers and engineering operations managers. This was in addition to the expected thousands of construction jobs. Officials said Amazon would partner with educational institutions and workforce organizations in the state to create training programs and STEM learning opportunities. In contrast to workforce investment, members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission opposed the proposal, arguing that costs would be shifted to ratepayers.

In Indiana, residents said recently xAI’s data center is impacting people’s health through air quality, and delivering only tens of jobs while receiving tax abatements.

Not all data center projects offer transparency about community benefits, and officials do not always disclose the benefits companies receive. One report found that most states offering incentives to data centers do not disclose which companies benefit. For example, the research found that Virginia forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue annually without public disclosure as to which companies are receiving these benefits.

GOVERNMENT CAN PUSH INDUSTRY TO DELIVER

Policymakers can take steps to protect communities, as a December report from Public Citizen outlined. These can include prohibiting NDAs and requiring a commitment to local hiring and apprenticeship programs. Officials can also require companies to deliver on minimum operational commitments, strict water conservation measures and renewable energy procurement.

Another strategy to ensure companies are benefiting the places where data centers are built is community benefits agreements. These contracts allow for data center expansion in ways that meet community-specific needs, as Brookings Center for Technology Innovation Director Nicol Turner Lee explained during a November panel discussion.

One example of such an agreement occurred in Lancaster, Penn. This pact committed the projects in question — multiple data center campus builds — to a water-use cap, and noise and air emissions controls. The developers also pledged to contribute $20 million to benefit the community; half will go toward economic development and half to sustainable development.

San Jose announced an agreement with PG&E in July to support the energy demands of new data center projects. City leaders were looking for a commitment of energy and infrastructure improvements; if their delivery timeline is not met, the city is able to step away from the agreement. While data centers in the city are not required to work with San Jose Clean Energy — which provides mainly carbon-free energy — many of them are, according to San Jose’s Deputy City Manager Manuel Pineda.

“We have been very upfront … with everything we’re trying to do with PG&E, with data center projects, and with all our communication — putting it out there so everybody knows what we’re doing and why we’re doing it,” Pineda said in November, noting that having data centers nearby supports the city’s innovation.

At the state level, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has introduced legislation to protect consumers from the costs of AI data centers, and plans to see it advance despite an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in December attempting to limit states’ regulatory authority on AI.

At the federal level, some legislators have proposed a national AI data center moratorium be enacted until consumer and environmental protections are addressed.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

The split among Democrats is part of a broader debate over whether Michigan should keep fast-tracking energy-hungry data center projects tied to the AI boom.
The commission said its order recognizes DTE’s legal obligation to serve the data center while imposing what it described as the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country.
“I remain extremely disappointed with the Commission’s decision to fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” Nessel said in a statement.
More than 5,000 public comments opposing the data center power deal were submitted to the commission ahead of its December vote.","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is urging state utility regulators to reconsider their approval of special power contracts for a massive data center planned in Washtenaw County, warning the fast-tracked decision could leave electric customers exposed to higher costs.

Nessel announced Friday that her office filed a petition for rehearing with the Michigan Public Service Commission over its Dec. 18 decision to conditionally approve two special contracts sought by DTE Energy to serve a proposed 1.4-gigawatt hyperscale artificial intelligence data center in Saline Township.

The project, tied to Oracle, OpenAI, and developer Related Digital, would be among the largest data centers in the country and is expected to consume as much electricity as nearly one million homes. Its scale has caused concerns among residents, environmental advocates, and consumer watchdogs about long-term impacts on electric rates, grid reliability, and the environment.

Nessel’s move also pits her against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a fellow Democrat who has publicly backed the data center as “the largest economic project in Michigan history.” Whitmer celebrated the project when it was announced last fall, citing thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent positions.

On Thursday, U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive Democrat, released what he called “terms of engagement” aimed at protecting communities from higher utility bills, grid strain, and environmental harm tied to data centers.

At least 15 data center projects have been proposed across the state in the past year.

The split among Democrats is part of a broader debate over whether Michigan should keep fast-tracking energy-hungry data center projects tied to the AI boom.

In her petition, Nessel challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts behind closed doors without holding a contested case hearing that would allow discovery, sworn testimony, and full public review. She also questions whether the conditions imposed by the commission are meaningful or enforceable.

In a statement Friday, the Michigan Public Service Commission said it “looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for rehearing,” but the commission “unequivocally rejects any claim that these contracts were inadequately reviewed.”

The commission said its professional staff, advisory staff, and commissioners were provided with unredacted versions of the special contracts and reviewed them thoroughly to ensure existing customers are protected. The commission said its order recognizes DTE’s legal obligation to serve the data center while imposing what it described as the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country.

The attorney general is seeking clarification on how those conditions would protect ratepayers, noting that many appear to rely on repeated assurances from DTE, rather than concrete commitments backed by evidence. Nessel also objected to the commission allowing DTE to serve as the project’s financial backstop, rather than requiring the data center operator to provide sufficient collateral to cover potential risks.

“I remain extremely disappointed with the Commission’s decision to fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” Nessel said in a statement. “This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect. ”

She said the commission’s approval process served the interests of DTE and the companies behind the project rather than Michigan residents.

“The Commission imposed some conditions on DTE to supposedly hold ratepayers harmless, but these conditions and how they’ll be enforced remain unclear,” Nessel said. “As Michigan’s chief consumer advocate, it is my responsibility to ensure utility customers in this state are adequately protected, especially on a project so massive, so expensive, and so unprecedented.”

Large portions of the contracts remain heavily redacted, preventing outside parties from verifying DTE’s claims that serving the data center will not raise rates for existing customers. Nessel said a contested case is necessary to review the full contracts, assess affordability claims, and confirm that protections, such as collateral requirements and exit fees are in place.

The commission ordered DTE to formally accept its conditions within 30 days of its Dec. 18 order. Nessel said that timeline complicates decisions about whether further legal challenges are necessary, prompting her office to file the rehearing petition in part to preserve its arguments.

The power contracts are one piece of a larger controversy surrounding the Saline Township project referred to as “Project Stargate.” Residents and environmental groups have raised alarms about wetlands destruction, water contamination risks, and the permanent transformation of a rural farming community.

More than 5,000 public comments opposing the data center power deal were submitted to the commission ahead of its December vote. Critics argue the rush to approve the contracts is part of a broader pattern as deep-pocketed utilities and developers seek to capitalize on the AI boom, which is driving a nationwide surge in electricity demand from large-scale data centers.

“As my office continues to review all potential options to defend energy customers in our state, we must demand further clarity on what protections the Commission has put in place and continue to demand a full contested case concerning these still-secret contracts,” Nessel said.

Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet.

Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.","CHICAGO — Amid warnings of impending energy shortages, Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What’s in the law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”
