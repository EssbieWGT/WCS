Much of the public discourse around AI centres around cybersecurity and such issues, but its environmental impact also needs to be considered.

While AI and the data centres it relies on use large amounts of energy and water, the technology can also be used to help tackle climate change.

By adopting practical strategies, there are actionable steps that organizations can take to align their AI strategies and sustainability goals.

Conversations around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business typically centre around data security, ethical uses and the risk of over-reliance on the emerging technology. But there is also growing discussion and concern around AI’s environmental footprint and rightly so.

With AI having a significant impact on energy and water consumption, as well as global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is vital that the subject of environmental sustainability is included in discussions around responsible AI.

Simultaneously, there’s an undeniable sense of renewed hope that AI can positively contribute to the global transition to a lower carbon economy. As AI’s impact rises alongside growing use of the technology, we must reflect on how it contributes to – and fights against – climate change.

AI’s growing appetite for energy and water

Over the past decade, demand for cloud computing and digital services has focused minds on energy optimization, with modern data centres increasingly adopting energy-efficient hardware and advance cooling systems leading to improved power usage effective averages across the industry. However, the reality is that the energy demands of AI, powered by data centres, significantly outpace current efficiency gains.

A single ChatGPT inquiry consumes about five times more electricity than that of a web search, while it is also estimated that training a single language model such as GPT-3 uses electricity equivalent to the power consumed annually by 130 US homes.

Then, there’s the energy consumption of AI image generation. While an AI model generating text in response to 1,000 prompts requires as much 16% of a full smartphone charge, generating an image requires the equivalent of 100%.

AI operations also come with high water demands as data centres require cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. GPT-3 is estimated to utilize about one 16-ounce bottle of water for every 10-50 responses it prepares and this quickly adds up when factoring in billions of queries – with AI’s projected annual water withdrawal to reach 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027.

Lastly, operational logistics, including construction and maintenance, account for up to two-thirds of a data centre's lifetime emissions. Emissions from building infrastructure, manufacturing IT equipment and chip manufacturing requirements of data centres contribute significantly to AI’s environmental footprint.

As AI workloads expand, so do their power demands. The World Bank estimates that AI’s wider industry category of information and communications technology currently generates at least 1.7% of global emissions. While this percentage may seem modest, current figures only reflect today’s reported AI usage and not tomorrow’s actual consumption.

AI adoption continues to accelerate – and also considering increased global digital penetration, expansion of cloud storage, internet of things uptake and the growing prevalence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies – the collective impact on climate change could become significantly larger, even as environmental efficiencies are factored in.

Under current growth trajectories, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global data centres may consume up to 1,000 TWh of electricity in 2026 – an increase of 400% from 2022.

Meanwhile, reports from major tech giants support these projections with Google and Microsoft recently disclosing year-on-year increases in emissions, warning these trends challenge their climate commitments. That said, many businesses are still innovating new ways to respond to the impacts of their energy use.

Mitigating the impact of AI energy consumption

Many prominent organizations associated with cloud computing and AI development have taken strong stances on tackling emissions and climate. For example:

Amazon has matched 100% of its operation’s global energy consumption with electricity generated by renewable energy systems.

Microsoft established a supplier code of conduct, requiring suppliers to transition to 100% carbon free electricity by 2030, and has committed to doing the same.

Google remains committed to their goal to rely on carbon-free electricity by 2030 and have launched efforts to improve their AI model efficiency and data-centre energy consumption.

OpenAI founder Sam Altman invested $20 million in Exowatt, which uses solar power to help meet the needs of OpenAI data centres.

Salesforce announced that it is lobbying for new regulations to compel companies to report AI emissions data and efficiency standards as part of its Sustainable AI Policy Priorities initiative.

Amid continued investment in computing infrastructure and AI development, looking to industry leaders can provide inspiration for improving energy management and reducing emissions.

Reducing AI energy consumption

As we consider the need to address the environmental impact of AI use as part of global efforts to build a sustainable future, organizations of all sizes can pull their weight in the following ways:

1. Measure emissions and reduction efforts

Leverage tools to measure, analyse and report your emissions over time

Work with suppliers to know how your AI use translates to energy consumption

2. Use efficient AI models and optimize AI workflows

Leverage pre-trained models and APIs

Compress models or use batch processing wherever possible

3. Comply with ISO 42001 requirements

When determining which ISO 42001 standards affect your organization’s AI management system, include climate change as a relevant factor

Conduct an AI system impact assessment, which evaluates societal impacts of your AI system, including the effects on environmental sustainability

4. Partner with sustainable vendors

Utilize AI and cloud platforms committed to renewable or carbon-free energy and that publish sustainability metrics and goals

Seek vendors who are ISO 14001 and ISO 42001 certified, which demonstrates their commitment to improving sustainability performance and using ethical AI systems

5. Foster a company-wide sustainability culture

Educate and train employees on emissions, energy demands and water use related to business and AI operations

Source ideas for sustainability-related efforts from employees and create an environmental sustainability employee resource group to lead the implementation of such measures

Engage with customers and suppliers to collaborate on ways to mitigate energy use and emissions

AI’s positive environmental impact

Amid the public discourse around AI and its undeniable environmental impact, many argue that it can also be a powerful tool in the fight against climate change – and they’re right.

AI can quickly and effectively analyse significant volumes of data to provide insights into climate trends and the effectiveness of emissions reduction strategies that can lead to faster action. Additional capabilities for AI to positively contribute to fighting climate change include:

Providing greater understanding of extreme weather climate risks

Modelling climate scenarios

Improving resource utilization and management

Expediting the development of new sustainable, energy-efficient materials

Reducing carbon footprints by forecasting demands and optimizing operations

Developing product life-cycle assessments to improve the accuracy of supply chain emissions calculations

Tackling AI-driven emissions

Maintaining awareness of the sustainability expectations of investors, suppliers and consumers, and tracking and reporting energy use and emissions, is best practice for organizations wanting to tackle AI-driven emissions.

Publishing an annual emissions inventory that is subject to third-party assurance or by becoming ISO 14001 certified, gives stakeholders confidence that you are committed to sustainability, while ISO 42001 certification also demonstrates a commitment to using ethical, trustworthy and accountable AI systems. It’s also vital to ensure you keep up with and emerging sustainability and AI regulations as they evolve.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output.
Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.
When consumers use nuclear power as well as solar panels, their energy bills can drop to near $0.
EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar.","Behind hydropower, nuclear energy is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that as of August 2023, there were 93 operating nuclear reactors at 54 sites in 28 states.

Google is about to add three more to that list.

Through nuclear site developer Elementl Power, Google will fund the project and plans to add 600 megawatts of generating capacity at all three sites, as reported by TechCrunch.

While the development company has yet to develop any power plants, its experience and understanding of the nuclear power industry make Elementl well-suited for such an ambitious and beneficial project.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output. There are currently no SMRs outside of China, but developers in the United States are attracted to them for their cost-effectiveness, short construction times, and nonexistent carbon output.

This initiative by Google and Elementl will financially benefit consumers whose electricity is sourced from nuclear power. The World Nuclear Association said nuclear plants are expensive to build but cheap to run. Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

Free energy is a dream, but it is entirely possible. When consumers use nuclear power as well as solar panels, their energy bills can drop to near $0. EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar. The company compares quotes for consumers and can potentially save them up to $10,000.

Clean energy can be a money-saver, giving consumers more finances for other essentials. This collaboration between Google and Elementl will benefit the planet and the economy.

In a press release, Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert said: ""Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power, and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals.""

Amanda Peterson Corio, the global head of data center energy at Google, said in the same release: ""Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy.""

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

Since his return to the Oval Office, Trump has positioned hydrocarbons as the backbone of the U.S. energy portfolio and also as a lever for exerting America’s geopolitical influence on the global stage. The focus on Washington’s utilization of natural resources as a geopolitical tool has centered around Europe, where the U.S. helped wean its transatlantic allies off their dependence on Russian gas. Trump’s push for Asian investment in the Alaska LNG project as a way to balance the region's trade with the U.S. amid the tariff disputes is a new test of U.S. energy diplomacy. Washington is seeking to leverage Asia’s growing demand for energy to compel renegotiations.

Is Alaskan LNG Moving Forward?

Once seen as a pipe dream hindered by challenges related to its scale, cost, and complexity, there is now renewed optimism regarding the $44 billion Alaska LNG project. The project, if built out, will move natural gas along an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic circle to Southern Alaska and then be shipped on tankers to Asia, providing access to Alaska’s more than 120 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the logistical benefit of avoiding the Panama Canal, reducing bottlenecks and drastically decreasing shipment times.

Following President Trump’s suggestion that trade partners can avoid tariffs by increasing their purchases of U.S. energy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that investments from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in the flagship LNG project could form the basis of a deal with those countries. If Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are implemented, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would face 24%, 25%, and 32% tariffs, respectively.

Japan’s biggest electricity producer and gas buyer, Jera, is considering participating as part of its effort to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., while officials from South Korea are expected to visit Alaska to discuss the project in the coming weeks. These developments follow announcements in March that Taiwanese state energy company CPC signed a nonbinding agreement with the state-run Alaska Gasline Development Group to buy U.S. LNG and invest in the project.

Asia’s Growing Energy Need

In addition to East Asia, U.S. tariff negotiations have brought several countries in Southeast and South Asia to the table, all of which are eager to purchase energy to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S.

There’s a strong convergence of interests on all sides, especially from Asia. With electricity demand in Southeast Asia growing at an annual rate of 4% and a heavy reliance on maritime oil and gas imports through the Strait of Malacca, Indo-Pacific energy security stands to benefit greatly from increased trade with the U.S.

Since the onset of negotiations, several countries have started to explore the possibility of buying American energy. Bangladesh signed an agreement with Louisiana-based Argent LNG for up to five million tons per year, Indonesia has offered to buy $10 billion of additional U.S. energy goods, and Vietnam announced provisional deals for the import of U.S. energy projects to avoid tariffs. Some countries have taken measures aside from increasing their purchases of American energy products. For example, India is weighing the option to scrap its import tax on American LNG in addition to boosting U.S. oil imports, and Thailand pledged to buy more U.S. energy commodities and reduce import tariff rates on LNG and ethanol

With China’s suspension of U.S. LNG imports and Italian energy giant ENI’s CEO Cristian Signoretto’s cautionary comments on the competitiveness of American LNG as the U.S. imposes tariffs, Washington is angling to find new customers as it streamlines regulations, works to increase efficiency, and cut costs for natural gas export projects along the Gulf Coast.

How Energy Fits into the U.S Multilateral Approach to Asia

The Trump Administration’s attempt to corral Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea into making significant investments in the Alaska LNG project signals a continuation of its departure from the U.S.’s historical “hubs and spokes” alliance system in Asia.

In addition to bilateral contacts between the U.S. and its Asian partners, Washington is no longer limiting its collective engagement in Asia to defense and security. Asian countries recognize the increasing importance of regional energy security, and the U.S.’s energy-focused outreach is striking a chord.

The Toyota bZ goes on sale in second half of 2025.

The 2026 Toyota bZ makes a leap forward with improvements for everything from the subcompact EV's name to its charging system. The 2022 bZ4X was an uncharacteristic disappointment from the world’s largest automaker. Overpriced and under-equipped, it was hamstrung by everything from uncompetitive technology to a ludicrous name.

Toyota listened to its critics and turned one of the world’s most formidable continuous improvement machines loose.

Renamed the bZ ― still not poetry, but the badge no longer looks like a laser printer threw up ― the new model is competitive with small electric SUVs like the Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona and Fiat 500e.

The 2026 bZ goes on sale in the second half of 2025. Detailed figures for price, range and charging will be available later.

I recently drove a loaded bZ Limited through the exurbs surrounding Toyota’s North America headquarters in Plano. It felt like a completely different vehicle from the bZ4X Limited I tested a couple of months ago.

Key improvements to 2026 Toyota bZ

25% range increase to 314 miles

50% power increase to 338 horsepower

NSCS charging port

Plug & Charge compatibility

Radical makeover

Improvements to the ’26 bZ start at the EV’s heart: battery, charging and motors.

The bZ gets two sizes of lithium-ion battery: a 74.7 kWh unit delivers up to 314 miles range and a 57.7 kWh unit rated at 236 miles. The battery is now capable of pre-conditioning, which speeds up charging and reduces energy use in cold weather.

A built-in NACS charging port provides access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network. An adaptor will be necessary for CCS chargers common at other charging stations. An onboard charger upgraded from 7 to 11 kW will hasten charging at the 240v connections most EV owners use at home. Plug & Charge software makes charging fast and easy at participating chargers including Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and Tesla.

Maximum power increases dramatically, from 214 to 338 hp for the AWD model and 201 to 221 hp for FWD.

The exterior styling benefits from updated front LED running lights and fascia that bring the nose into harmony with Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" nose. Body-color front fascia and cladding around the wheels is also new.

Driving impressions

The ’26 fairly leaps away from stops compared with its under-power predecessor. Toyota claims a 4.9-seconds 0-60 mph for the AWD bZ. It was mum on the previous model’s acceleration, and not out of modesty.

The steering was responsive in my time in neighborhoods, shopping districts and along wide, smooth roads that curved between corporate campuses and public parks.

The brakes are firm and easy to modulate. New steering column paddles adjust regenerative braking to recapture energy, but there’s no one-pedal setting to bring the bZ to a full stop.

The front seat is roomy, with a big center console that holds two new wireless charging pads. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

The new dash has a 14-inch touch screen. The instrument cluster is new, too, bigger and easier to read.

A heat pump reduces energy use for heating and cooling the cabin.

Standard heated steering wheel and front seats further reduce cold-weather energy use. Climate control options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a radiant front-seat foot and leg heater.

Why buy a 2026 Toyota bZ?

Price and charging time are huge unknowns, but there’s lots to like about the 2026 Toyota bZ.

Its improved power and battery size give it competitive performance and range. Revised lights and exterior color pattern make it look like a grown-up vehicle, as opposed to the bZ4X’s cobbled-together appearance.

The interior of my bZ Limited was comfortable, trimmed in appealing soft materials and roomy.

It’s a huge step forward to Toyota’s EV status, worth a look from anybody shopping for a small electric SUV.

The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy.","When millions of people across the Iberian peninsula were left without power last month the political fallout ignited debate over Europe’s renewable energy agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Despite long-held environmental concerns about nuclear power generation, political leaders across the globe are increasingly looking to lift restrictions on nuclear reactors or invest billions in new projects to keep pace with the fast-rising demand for low-carbon energy, which is expected to accelerate as AI datacentres grow.

In Spain, the blackout has intensified an ongoing debate over the government’s plans to phase out the country’s remaining seven nuclear reactors by 2035. Support for the low-carbon energy source has re-emerged hand-in-hand with criticism of renewable energy, and its potential role in the outage.

Spain’s power grid relied on renewable energy for about 70% of its power at the time of the blackout, which experts believe may have made it more difficult for the energy system operator to keep the grid’s frequency stable.

The suggestion was vehemently denied by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the country’s parliament. Just hours after the blackout he said: “There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”

But even before the Iberian peninsula was plunged into chaos, critics of the government’s anti-nuclear stance had raised their concerns. A few weeks before the blackout, the chair of the renewable energy company Iberdrola, which owns a small stake in the country’s nuclear fleet, warned Spain against plans to shut all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2035.

Ignacio Galán predicted that Spain could see its electricity prices jump by a quarter and get a less reliable system if Madrid followed the example of Germany, which began to close its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 and completed the phase-out in 2023.

Days later Sama Bilbao y León, director-general of the World Nuclear Association, told a conference in Madrid that she was “concerned about Spain’s economic future without nuclear energy” because its economic progress would rely on “abundant, clean, and affordable energy, available every day, all year round”.

In Germany the hardline stance against nuclear power is already softening. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in February, has criticised the previous government for shutting Germany’s last three nuclear power stations in the midst of Europe’s energy cost crisis and promised to explore whether it is possible to resurrect the plants.

Merz is not expected to back a return to new conventional nuclear power projects in Germany but he has vowed to invest in new technologies: such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion. The Swiss government has also said it will lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power projects, which has been in place since 1 January 2018, to pursue SMR projects.

The tide against nuclear power is turning in countries beyond Europe too. In Australia the new coalition government wasted little time in lifting the country’s ban on nuclear generators with a promise to commit $36.4bn in equity for two projects that it says could be operating by the mid 2030s – and $118.2bn for the seven projects it has promised by 2050.

Later this summer Taiwan is expected to vote on whether to restart a nuclear reactor which shut just last week amid concerns on the island about the rising electricity demand of some of the world’s biggest chipmakers which are based there, and about energy security in the event of a military blockade by China.

The concerns about a looming surge in power demand driven by tech giants and the desire for secure, homegrown low-carbon energy sources are common in countries across the globe. This trend is key to the renewed interest in nuclear power.

In the US, the notorious Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania will restart for the first time in five years after its owners struck a 20-year deal to power Microsoft’s energy-hungry AI datacentres. Tech companies including Amazon, Meta and Apple are all expected to consume vast amounts of energy to power the boom in AI, and nuclear has emerged as an increasingly popular option given its steady stream of 24/7 power generation.

US President Donald Trump, who has taken aim at the Biden administration’s support for renewable energy, this month unveiled a series of executive orders aimed at delivering 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030, and quadrupling the country’s nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The move was welcomed by nuclear proponents as a step towards helping to lower emissions in the US while supporting Big Tech.

“Several big tech companies looking for low carbon, round-the-clock energy signed contracts for new nuclear capacity in the last year, and there could be more such deals ahead,” predicted the US investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year.

“The proliferation of AI data centers has boosted investor confidence in future growth in electricity demand at the same time as big tech companies are looking for low-carbon reliable energy. This is leading to the de-mothballing of recently retired nuclear generators, as well as consideration for new larger-scale reactors,” it added.

The growing demand for electricity may have piqued the interest of global government in nuclear power, but it is the breakthrough in new nuclear technologies which promises a new dawn for the industry. Whereas full-scale nuclear projects are notorious for spiralling budgets and delays, SMRs promise quicker, cheaper construction because the component parts can be built in a factory and assembled on site. But the technology has not been proven commercially.

Last year Google became the first company to ink an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), which are being developed by Kairos Power in the US. Small modular reactors are also being pursued by the US, South Korea, China, Russia, and Canada. The latter approved the construction of the first mini-nuclear reactor in the West earlier this month which is expected to begin operating by 2029.

In the UK, Keir Starmer unveiled plans for a historic expansion in nuclear power across England and Wales shortly after calling for tech companies to work alongside the government to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy intensive AI datacentres across Britain. He said that he anticipated smaller reactors could begin operating in 2032 and become commonplace across Britain.

The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy. Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist and a director at Greenpeace UK, said the Labour government had “swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915e7e6a0aa77637bfde048486c43968640e9752/176_0_4520_3616/master/4520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2318dbeb1db340eae8fa3d811aa4a876,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:03.514118

The decision, which affects major carbon capture and clean technology initiatives, comes as the Donald Trump administration re-evaluates publicly funded awards and loans aimed at emerging technologies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said.

Among the canceled projects is a $332 million carbon-cutting initiative at Exxon Mobil’s Baytown refinery complex in Texas, which aimed to reduce emissions by using hydrogen instead of natural gas to produce ethylene, a key component in plastics and textiles, Reuters news report said. Other major projects affected include a $500 million award to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Nearly 70 percent of the canceled awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election and January 20, 2025, Biden’s final day in office.

The move reflects the Trump administration’s shift in energy policy, which prioritizes maximizing oil and gas output while rolling back key aspects of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. The administration has framed the decision as part of a broader effort to reassess government spending on emerging technologies.

Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have strongly criticized the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the decision “short-sighted” and warned it could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the termination of the projects could result in the loss of up to 25,000 jobs and a $4.6 billion hit to economic output.

The affected companies, including Exxon Mobil, Heidelberg Materials, and Eastman Chemical, have not yet responded to requests for comment.

The canceled projects were part of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations’ efforts to test carbon capture and storage technologies at industrial sites. Carbon capture projects aim to mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air or from industrial emissions for long-term storage underground. In some cases, the captured CO₂ is injected into depleted oil fields to enhance crude production.

The cuts have fueled debate over the future of U.S. climate policy, as the country faces mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining energy security and industrial competitiveness.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.","The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.

Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.

Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.

Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.

Data centers fuel growth forecasts

Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.

But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.

PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.

PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.

“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”

Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.

Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.

The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.

Clean energy versus fossil fuels

Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.

The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.

Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.

They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.

Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.

“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.

Public, protestors weigh in

Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.

Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.

However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.

The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.

“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”

Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.

“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2696-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:19.081140

Trump said: “I have known Lee Zeldin for a long time, and have watched him handle, brilliantly, some extremely difficult and complex situations. I am very proud to have him in the Trump Administration, where he will quickly prove to be a great contributor.”

However, Zeldin, a former member of Congress representing a district including eastern Long Island, has faced stiff criticism, beginning with his nomination, that has continued.

“Unqualified,” declared Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation’s largest environmental organization, upon the Zeldin nomination.

It “lays bare Donald Trump’s intentions to, once again, sell our health, our communities, our jobs and future out to corporate polluters,” he said. “Our lives, our livelihoods, and our collective future cannot afford Lee Zeldin — or anyone who seeks to carry out a mission antithetical to the EPA’s mission.”

The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of the Senate signed by its president, Gene Karpinski, called on it to reject the nomination. Cited was the organization’s “National Environmental Scorecard which details the voting records of members of Congress on environmental legislation,” on which “Zeldin’s abysmal 14% lifetime score …. [renders] him unqualified for the role.”

“Trump Picks New EPA Head Guaranteed to Destroy the Environment,” was the headline in The New Republic. The subhead on its article: “This will be a disaster.”

“Meet the ‘great deregulator’ Trump chose to lead EPA,” was the headline of the E&E website of Politico.

The headline of the New York Metropolitan Area news website Hell Gate said: “Lee Zeldin Appointed to Oversee Climate Collapse.” The subhead: “Trump choosing a Long Island lackey as EPA administrator.”

There were some hoorays for the nomination. “Congrats to Representative Zeldin on his nomination to be the 17th EPA administrator,” said Andrew Wheeler, an EPA administrator under Trump in his first term as president. Prior to that, he was a lobbyist for major coal, chemical and uranium companies.

And Elon Musk said of Zeldin’s nomination: “I know he will do a great job tackling the regulatory overreach while protecting our air and water.”

Zeldin has been a close ally of Trump. In 2021, he was among Republican members of the House who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election, which Trump said he won. Also, Zeldin was a leader in defending Trump during Trump’s first impeachment hearings.

With Zeldin in office as EPA administrator, Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, ran an article speaking of “axing programs and funding intended to address pollution and advance clean energy.”

“At the EPA, there has been an exodus of employees, a freeze on funding disbursement — including funds already authorized by Congress — as well as a dismissal of scientific advisory boards and a removal of climate change references from the agency’s website,” it reads.

In April, Zeldin, a Shirley resident, faced 100 protesters when he came to the Crest Hollow Country Club in Westbury to speak at an event hosted by the Long Island Association.

The demonstration was organized by Food & Water Watch and the Long Island Progressive Coalition. At it, Eric Weltman, New York senior organizer at Food & Water Watch, said “New Yorkers deserve an EPA that protects our health and environment, not one that does the bidding of corporate polluters.”

In May, there was sharp criticism of Zeldin after he announced the EPA was dropping federal limits on four “forever chemicals” in drinking water. The weakening of the rules is “a betrayal of public trust,” charged Adriene Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment based in Farmingdale. It “adds a significant threat to public health,” she said.

Still, Zeldin remains supported by nearly all Republican members of Congress. At a hearing in May of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at which he appeared, its chair, Senator Shelley Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, opened it by telling Zeldin, “I applaud your aggressive efforts to undo the previous administration’s regulatory overreach.”

But at the same hearing, Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told Zeldin: “I want to be very specific about the legacy you’re going to leave …. more cancer.”",https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2018-05-22T160115Z_1564032435_HP1EE5M18I32M_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RUSSIA-1.webp?w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:48.073056

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria.
Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector.
“Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said.
He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.","The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has secured 130 paid energy jobs for young Nigerian graduates under its newly launched NextGen Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) programme. The initiative, which officially kicked off this month, aims to create a clear pathway from training to employment for aspiring professionals in the country’s fast-growing clean energy sector.

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a collaborative effort between REA, the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), and the Eco-Innovation Empowerment Initiative. According to REA, the programme is designed to train, mentor, and place talented youth in paid internships and jobs across the country within a 12-month cycle. “We are not just training people, we are launching careers,” said REA’s Managing Director and CEO, Engr. Abba Aliyu, during the programme’s unveiling in Abuja.

Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector. “Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said. He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.

Speaking to journalists, Aliyu said, “This programme is not only about creating 130 jobs. It is about building a national talent pipeline that will produce 10,000 energy professionals in the coming years. The gap between theory and hands-on skills is costing us, and we are here to close that gap.” According to him, the pilot programme last year placed 120 graduates across the six geopolitical zones and laid the foundation for the current expansion.

The NextGen RESCO initiative places greater emphasis on technical capacity than academic pedigree. “A degree is important, yes, but what this sector needs are people who can wire a solar mini-grid, calibrate inverters, and maintain battery systems,” Aliyu said. He added that the programme includes three months of classroom training, one month of internship with Renewable Energy Service Companies (RESCOs), and nine months of paid work placements.

Ahmed Nagode, Director-General of NAPTIN, echoed Aliyu’s sentiments. “Only 50 percent of the skilled workforce needed to sustain Nigeria’s power sector is currently available,” Nagode revealed. “Our graduates have knowledge, but many lack industry-grade technical skills. This programme is our answer to that crisis.” He also warned of the consequences of inaction, pointing to deteriorating solar infrastructure in the capital. “Streetlights powered by solar energy in Abuja may fail in the next five years if not maintained by skilled professionals,” he said.

A press release from REA further emphasized that the programme’s curriculum includes training in solar PV installation, mini-grid design, energy efficiency audits, and PV system supervision. “We are developing not just workers, but professionals who can innovate, manage systems, and lead projects,” the statement read. REA also confirmed that application is now open to qualified Nigerians nationwide.

Participants will benefit from paid internships and guaranteed jobs secured through partnerships with private RESCOs. According to REA, top-performing trainees will transition into nine-month, fully paid roles in the renewable energy sector. “These are not vague promises—these are signed agreements with our partners,” Aliyu stated.

By investing in skills and job placements, REA hopes to anchor Nigeria’s clean energy transition in local expertise. “We want to ensure that the people powering Nigeria’s energy future are young, homegrown talents who understand the terrain and the technology,” said Aliyu. With this initiative, the government aims not only to tackle unemployment but also to lay the groundwork for a sustainable, resilient energy system.",https://i0.wp.com/thenigeriaeducationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1000157294-1.jpg?fit=2880%2C1620&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:40.788731

As part of the first-half stage of development, Toyota has been refining the durability of liquid hydrogen pumps as well as technologies such as oval tanks that extend cruising range.

In last year’s Fuji 24 Hours Race, while Toyota’s team met its goal of running 30 consecutive laps on a single hydrogen refill, issues with the electrical system forced repeated pit stops, preventing the car from running for a sufficient amount of time.

The goal for this year’s race is to run for the entire 24 hours with a more reliable vehicle and liquid hydrogen system and to utilize the data obtained for future development, with the goal of making ever-better motorsports-bred cars.

Further evolution of the liquid hydrogen-powered GR Corolla. As the culmination of the first-half stage of the liquid hydrogen-powered GR Corolla, Toyota has made the following technical improvements for this race based on the results of last year’s race.

Taking on the challenge of utilizing a hydrogen engine combustion switching technology that balances high output and fuel efficiency. Starting with this race, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that automatically switches between stoichiometric combustion, which delivers high output, and lean combustion, which enables fuel-efficient driving, in response to the driver’s output requirements (accelerator operation).

Until now, Toyota has continued to improve stoichiometric combustion to achieve high output equivalent to that of gasoline.

From this race onwards, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that smoothly switches to lean combustion when high output is not required with a view to applying it to the development of future production vehicles.

Developing a new filling valve that improves hydrogen filling speed and safety while making the vehicle compact and lightweight. Toyota has adopted a new structure for the filling valve used during hydrogen supply.

To date, valve opening and closing have been operated by an external actuator. However, in addition to limitations in expanding the flow path area during hydrogen supply, there have been challenges with improving airtightness in a -253 °C environment.

For this race, adopting a new internal piston structure has enabled an increase in flow path area, improving filling speed by approximately 30%. The new structure also eliminates the need for an external actuator, reducing weight by 2 kg. Furthermore, eliminating external opening and closing processes has improved airtightness and reduced the risk of hydrogen leakage.

Reducing vehicle weight through partial use of aluminum wiring for wire harnesses. A portion of the wire harnesses―bundles of wires distributed throughout the vehicle for power supply and signal transmission―has been changed from copper to aluminum wiring. Until now, corrosion caused by water exposure at terminal connections and other areas has posed a challenge in using aluminum wiring for wire harnesses.

For this race, adopting a sealed-structure terminal (Alpha terminal) using fiber laser welding technology developed by Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. has made it possible to prevent water infiltration without compromising mass-producibility and cost competitiveness, thereby preventing corrosion, which had been an issue.

This change has also resulted in an 18% weight reduction compared to conventional wire harnesses.",https://bioage.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4fbe53ef02e8610271e4200d-600wi,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:57.657548

“From satellite skies to solar campuses, and from mechanized farms to biotech labs—Nigeria is rising, and it is powered by innovation.”","By Ikechukwu Emmanuel

Chief Uche Geoffrey Nnaji, Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, has applauded President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for steering Nigeria into a new era of science-driven, innovation-led development within the past two years.

In a statement signed by his Senior Special Adviser (Administration), Dr. Robert Ngwu, the Minister described the Tinubu administration as a “powerhouse of progress,” citing milestone achievements across clean energy, digital innovation, healthcare, security, agriculture, and job creation.

One of the administration’s flagship initiatives is the Renewed Hope Solarisation Project—a first-of-its-kind energy gift to Nigeria’s tertiary institutions and federal teaching hospitals. Under this initiative, each of the 36 states and the FCT will receive a 2MW solar hybrid power system, targeting one federal university and one federal teaching hospital per state.

“This pilot phase offers eco-friendly, reliable electricity to institutions long burdened by erratic power and rising utility costs,” Nnaji stated. “It is a beacon of hope and a foundation for national rollout.”

The Ministry is also advancing the Sustainable Energy Access Project (SEAP)—a nationwide clean energy and clean cooking initiative covering all 774 local governments. Full-scale implementation is projected to create nearly one million jobs, with a strong focus on youth, women, and artisans—echoing the Renewed Hope Agenda’s commitment to inclusive development.

In the domain of space technology, President Tinubu approved the launch of four new satellites—NigeriaSat-3, Sat-4, Sat-5, and NigeriaSAR-1—under the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). These assets will bolster national security, disaster response, border surveillance, agriculture, and geospatial land administration.

Another milestone is the formulation and national validation of Nigeria’s first Cleantech Innovation Policy, developed through the National Cleantech Innovation Programme (NCIP) with support from international partners. The policy aims to fast-track Nigeria’s green industrial revolution, climate resilience, and economic diversification. Its full implementation is expected to generate over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs in sectors such as agritech, renewable energy, circular economy, green transportation, and smart manufacturing.

Special emphasis is placed on empowering women, youth, and persons with disabilities, through inclusive funding, training platforms, and national mentorship schemes.

To reduce Nigeria’s overreliance on raw material exports and curb the costly dependence on imported finished goods, the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, through RMRDC, has proposed the 30% Minimum Value-Addition Bill. This pioneering legislation mandates that at least 30% of local value must be added to raw materials before they are exported or utilized in industrial production.

In a predominantly import-driven economy, the bill is a strategic policy shift designed to stimulate domestic manufacturing, enhance export earnings through value-added goods, and create widespread employment across key sectors such as agro-processing, extractives, and light industry. It also seeks to strengthen supply chain resilience, foster SME growth, and reduce vulnerability to global market shocks. By anchoring industrial progress on local capacity and innovation, the bill aligns with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and reinforces Nigeria’s path to economic self-reliance and competitiveness.

As part of the Ministry’s industrialization strategy, the revival and optimization of the cassava value chain has become a strategic national priority. Leveraging Nigeria’s comparative advantage as one of the world’s largest producers of cassava, the Ministry is facilitating the deployment of mechanized and semi-automated processing systems to enhance value addition, reduce post-harvest losses, and create high-impact jobs across rural communities.

A central component of this initiative is the extraction and industrial utilization of high-grade starch from cassava (HGCS), which serves as a versatile industrial raw material with a wide array of downstream applications spanning multiple sectors like food and beverage (Glucose syrup, sweeteners, baking ingredients, modified starch), pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals (Tablet binding, dietary supplements and excipients, medical-grade glucose and dextrose), industrial and chemical manufacturing (Adhesives and glues, Biodegradable plastics and packaging materials, Paper sizing and coating agents, Textile finishing agents, Ethanol and industrial alcohol production), cosmetics and personal care (Starch-based baby powders, Organic thickeners and skin-conditioning agents), and agriculture and animal feed (Livestock feed concentrates, Binders in fish and poultry feed, Biofertilizer components).

By fostering the development of these value chain products, the Ministry is unlocking significant opportunities for import substitution, export diversification, and rural industrialization. This intervention aligns strongly with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and is poised to transform cassava from a subsistence crop into a strategic industrial commodity driving national prosperity.

Similarly, a €7.9 billion Green and Blue Methanol Industrial Complex is in the works to deliver decarbonization in blue economy, and low-carbon fuels, reinforcing Nigeria’s leadership in Africa’s clean energy transition.

In line with the clarion call of President Tinubu, GCFRlllllll, the Ministry has made a significant push toward research commercialization, with industrial-scale fabrication of agro-processing equipment—crushers, mixers, dryers, stoves, ovens—aimed at improving food security and reducing post-harvest losses. These machines are now being deployed in semi-automated production lines for palm oil, cassava, plantain, soybean, vegetable oil, etc.

One of the country’s most notable health breakthroughs is the development and field-testing of Nigeria’s first Artemisinin Extraction Plant, which extracts the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from domesticated Artemisia annua—a game-changing innovation in the fight against malaria.

The National Research and Innovation Fund (NRIF), which is currently being finalized will empower scientists to commercialize their findings, with a pipeline of over 1000 patents expected annually. These outcomes position Nigeria as a knowledge economy anchored on innovation, not just consumption.

President Tinubu also established an Inter-Ministerial Innovation Committee, chaired by the Vice President, to align innovation and job creation targets across all MDAs. With support from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics Nigeria now tracks metrics such as job creation, emissions reduction, and gender participation using real-time dashboards.

Under Tinubu’s strategic foreign policy, the Ministry has secured new partnerships with UNDP, UNESCO, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the African Development Bank, boosting investment flows into Nigeria’s innovation ecosystem.

“Thank you, Mr. President,” Nnaji concluded. “From satellite skies to solar campuses, and from mechanized farms to biotech labs—Nigeria is rising, and it is powered by innovation.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Uche-Geoffrey-Nnaji.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:27.891518

In conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the [statement].”

Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.","A bill pending on Beacon Hill that looks to set a statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goal as part of the decarbonization push has ignited national backlash, with critics calling it governmental overreach.

Under the so-called Freedom to Move Act, an interagency coordinating council would be tasked with crafting a “whole-of-government plan” to reduce reliance on personal vehicles and increase access to public transportation in the Bay State.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation – the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.

Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem, a Newton Democrat, is leading the push to shift the Bay State away from relying “too heavily” on electric vehicles as a “decarbonizing strategy.”

“With the Trump administration rolling back vehicle emission standards and withholding funds from EV charging programs,” Creem said during a legislative hearing in mid-May, “and with congressional Republicans looking to repeal EV tax credits and derail state-level EV rules, now is the time to pursue new strategies, additional strategies.”

“Setting specific goals for reducing vehicle miles traveled would help guide decisions made across state government,” she added, “and sharpen the focus of efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, walking.”

A clip of Creem’s tesimony has gone viral in the weeks following the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy’s hearing on May 14.

Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform. Fox News’ ‘The Faulkner Focus’ also featured it in a segment titled “Democrats divided over how to move forward,” last Tuesday.

In the segment, anchor Harris Faulkner interviewed conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, who noted a survey that MassInc conducted last year showing that 70% of respondents “felt unsafe on public transit in the Greater Boston area.”

“People want to be safe,” Knowles said. “You need to give people some kind of option to vote for you. As Democrats are struggling with being viewed as so out of touch, I don’t think this lady in Massachusetts is going to help.”

State Rep. Mike Connolly, a Cambridge Democrat, is one of the bill’s eight co-sponsors. He told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the way the bill is being portrayed is “completely overblown and ignorant.”

“This legislation doesn’t attempt to set some specific limit or establish any kind of prescriptive formula to punish individual drivers, as the right-wing reporting on this seemed to imply,” Connolly said. “All it really does is say that we should put the structures in place to consider and refine our policies around vehicle miles traveled.”

The bill’s summary states that MassDOT’s transportation plans must “provide a reasonable pathway to compliance with our emissions limits for the transportation sector.” If those reductions aren’t met, the agency would have to make a “greater investment in public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, or other clean transportation options.”

Regional planning organizations and MassDOT would also be required to approve only projects with “a reasonable pathway to compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions sublimits … and the statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goals.”

Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, a watchdog group, thrust the bill into the national spotlight, with a May 23 post garnering nearly 350,000 views on X and being multiplied further by prominent conservative accounts.

Organization spokesman Paul Diego Craney says the legislation would be “incredibly damaging to the state economy and restrict transportation for countless residents.”

“Massachusetts lawmakers need to reverse course on the state’s mandate to hit net-zero by 2050,” Craney told the Herald on Saturday, “which is driving these lawmakers to propose some extreme pieces of legislation … Net-zero is nothing more than a fantasy.”

The interagency coordinating council would be created through the legislation, consisting of 15 state officials.

The group would assess and report on strategies “necessary to reduce statewide vehicles miles traveled through the establishment of an equitable, interconnected, accessible and reliable network of non-personal vehicle transportation options and through land use policies that reduce the need for personal vehicles,” according to the bill.

Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, has raised concerns that the bill may not be practical in all parts of the Commonwealth.

“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill. He added it raises the “question of what someone is to do in a place where one has to travel a long distance” to work.

A statewide coalition of environmental organizations reported last December that transportation represents “37% of total emissions statewide, and it is one of the sectors where we have made the least progress toward our statutory Clean Energy and Climate Plan goals.”

One of the targets in that plan is for there to be “200,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025,” but the Bay State was “below half that total” at end of last year, according to the coalition.

State data shows that “light-duty vehicles” traveled 57,191 million miles in 2023, a figure projected to grow to “about 59,100 million in 2030.”

Seth Gadbois, a clean transportation staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, highlighted that the bill is based on laws in Minnesota and Colorado, which redirected funding away from highway projects towards bus corridors.

Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.

“This absence leads to disparate and uncoordinated efforts to give people more options for how to get around,” he said, “all while miles driven by car and emissions continue to increase year over year.”

New Bedford resident Elijah DeSousa, founder of the energy advocacy group Citizens Against Eversource, told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the bill is not “just another climate proposal,” but a “blueprint for behavioral control disguised as environmental policy.”

“I refuse to quietly surrender the most fundamental right we have as citizens: the right to move freely, without needing permission from unelected councils or state-issued metrics,” he said.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0624-NWS-BHR-L-traffic-cc01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:22.146389

India, a major carbon emitter, is aggressively expanding its clean energy sector, with solar power becoming increasingly cost-effective. While coal still dominates electricity generation, renewable energy capacity is rapidly growing, driven by government policies and private investments. Challenges remain in optimizing renewable energy use and building necessary infrastructure to meet the nation's soaring energy demands and climate goals.

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is also making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun, wind and other clean energy sources. Most of the electricity in India, the world's most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal's dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India's power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts - enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Renewable energy is now the most economical option Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

""Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,"" said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the ""new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

""I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,"" said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Government policies and private investments push renewables Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation's energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world's largest wind and solar power farms.

""We've seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,"" said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Still, renewables are underutilized Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India's total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

At a clean energy crossroads A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 - driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

""India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can't keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

In Charlotte, it was AVL Manufacturing, promising to build a new production facility resulting in 325 new jobs.

In Holly Springs, it was biotechnology company Genentech, announcing plans to build a new manufacturing plant with 420 jobs.

In Goldsboro, it was transformer manufacturer Prolec-GE Waukesha, also with a new manufacturing plant, and 330 jobs.

Those are just three of a slew of businesses coming to the state this year.

So it was no surprise that when Stein delivered a speech at the Emerging Issues Forum on energy at N.C. State University this week, the subject went beyond policy to talk about the economy and business.

Good morning and welcome to the Sunday Under the Dome newsletter, which focuses on the governor. I’m Capitol Bureau Chief Dawn Vaughan.

In his speech at N.C. State on Wednesday, Stein said that while the state has more work ahead to reduce pollution and have a clean tech economy, “in many ways, the market demands that we do.”

“Nearly half of the leading companies in the world have a net zero emissions target. Many of these companies want to call North Carolina home. In fact, many of them already do: Amazon, Google, Meta, Toyota, Honeywell. When these companies decided where to invest, they were looking for a strong workforce, a favorable business environment, an excellent quality of life and places where they could get inexpensive, clean and reliable electricity,” Stein said.

He talked about another one of his economic development announcements, held in April in Greenville, when Boviet Solar opened a new solar module factory.

“Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said at the time.

“They have already hired 400 employees, nearly, and they’re going to keep hiring. If things progress as they fully expect, when they get to phase two, that number should increase to over 1,000 employees, making them one of the largest private sector employers in the county of Pitt,” Stein said in his energy speech this past week.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.

Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.”

“Here’s the thing. Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” he said.

“They were told that these credits existed. Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina. We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

But one important aspect of taxation has been largely ignored: tax credits.

Tax credits were included in the Inflation Reduction Act from the Biden administration and, along with discounts on the purchase and installation of energy-efficient electric appliances, vehicles, solar systems and more, have allowed great progress toward a more sustainable energy economy in addition to creating jobs and investment in new industries, as well as benefiting Americans who took advantage of them.

A national poll conducted by Yale University’s Communication Program on Climate Change found that 63% of Nevadans are worried about climate change, identical to the national average. That number was 1% higher in Clark County, and 6% higher in Washoe County. This is significant in a state that has the two fastest-warming cities in the country, Reno and Las Vegas.

Most people likely understand that the driving force behind the worsening climate is the burning of fossil fuels. Giving people concrete steps they can take really activates them. And tax credits have done just that. Many have embraced the opportunity to replace their fossil fuel cars and appliances with those that utilize sustainable electric energy; these purchases of replacements have been amplified by the discounts and tax credits available to them, usually up to 30% or more.

The additional benefit of tax credits is the energy savings; more money in people’s pockets because their energy bills are lower. This has a direct impact on the economy in two ways: Americans have more money to spend on other things, and there are more jobs created for industries that provide the new appliances, cars, solar systems and more. Indeed, Nevada has been identified as one of the top states for jobs in the solar industry.

Each year the potential energy savings can be hundreds of dollars. Think of the benefit to lower-income people when they don’t have to spend $300 or more a month just to feel comfortable in their home; there is evidence that some people simply avoid turning on their air conditioner when the temperature soars because they can’t afford it. In Clark County, extreme heat’s death toll in 2024 was 527. Tax credits, especially for solar, can help save lives.

Now that the reconciliation bill goes to the Senate for markup, we must contact our senators to insist that tax credits be included. This isn’t a partisan issue: Republicans from rural areas say sustainable energy infrastructure such as solar and wind in their areas is very popular, because the taxes from increased revenue have paved the way for desirable and necessary civic improvements. As the demand for sustainable energy grows, the desirability of tax credits increases. Our senators must encourage their Republican colleagues to join them in voting for maintaining tax credits.",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:26.115338

“People in the U.S. don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau.
As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberg analysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia.
Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity.
Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa.","GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Ariz.—About 33 miles south of Phoenix, Interstate 10 bisects a line of solar panels traversing the desert like an iridescent snake. The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert.

The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the U.S. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind.

In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely-watched water users in the West in the process.

The community’s investments come at a critical time for the Colorado River, which supplies water to about 40 million people across seven Western states, Mexico and 30 tribes, including GRIC. Annual consumption from the river regularly exceeds its supply, and a decades-long drought, fueled in part by climate change, continues to leave water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead dangerously low.

Covering water with solar panels is not a new idea. But for some it represents an elegant mitigation of water shortages in the West. Doing so could reduce evaporation, generate more carbon-free electricity and require dams to run less frequently to produce power.

But, so far, the technology has not been included in the ongoing Colorado River negotiations between the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada, tribes and Mexico. All are expected to eventually agree on cuts to the system’s water allocations to maintain the river’s ability to provide water and electricity for residents and farms, and keep its ecosystem alive.

“People in the U.S. don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau. “They’re not willing to look at it and try and factor it” into the negotiations.

Several Western water managers Inside Climate News contacted for this story said they were open to learning more about floating solar—Colorado has even studied the technology through pilot projects. But, outside of GRIC’s project, none knew of any plans to deploy floating solar anywhere in the basin. Some listed costly and unusual construction methods and potentially modest water savings as the primary obstacles to floating solar maturing in the U.S.

A Tantalizing Technology With Tradeoffs

A winery in Napa County, California, deployed the first floating solar panels in the U.S. on an irrigation pond in 2007. The country was still years away from passing federal legislation to combat the climate crisis, and the technology matured here haltingly. As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberg analysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia.

Unlike many Asian countries, the U.S. has an abundance of undeveloped land where solar could be constructed, said Prateek Joshi, a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who has studied floating solar, among other forms of energy. “Even though [floating solar] may play a smaller role, I think it’s a critical role in just diversifying our energy mix and also reducing the burden of land use,” he said.

This February, NREL published a study that found floating solar on the reservoirs behind federally owned dams could provide enough electricity to power 100 million U.S. homes annually, but only if all the developable space on each reservoir were used.

Lake Powell could host almost 15 gigawatts of floating solar using about 23 percent of its surface area, and Lake Mead could generate over 17 gigawatts of power on 28 percent of its surface. Such large-scale development is “probably not going to be the case,” Joshi said, but even if a project used only a fraction of the developable area, “there’s a lot of power you could get from a relatively small percentage of these Colorado Basin reservoirs.”

The study did not measure how much water evaporation floating solar would prevent, but previous NREL research has shown that photovoltaic panels—sometimes called “floatovoltaics” when they are deployed on reservoirs—could also save water by changing the way hydropower is deployed.

Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity. As late as December, when a typical Western dam would be running low, lakes with floating solar could still have enough water to produce hydropower, reducing reliance on more expensive backup energy from gas-fired power plants.

Joshi has spoken with developers and water managers about floating solar before, and said there is “an eagerness to get this [technology] going.” The technology, however, is not flawless.

Solar arrays can be around 20 percent more expensive to install on water than land, largely because of the added cost of buoys that keep the panels afloat, according to a 2021 NREL report. The water’s cooling effect can boost panel efficiency, but floating solar panels may produce slightly less energy than a similarly sized array on land because they can’t be tilted as directly toward the sun as land-based panels.

And while the panels likely reduce water loss from reservoirs, they may also increase a water body’s emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn warm the climate and increase evaporation. This January, researchers at Cornell University found that floating solar covering more than 70 percent of a pond’s surface area increased the water’s CO2 and methane emissions. These kinds of impacts “should be considered not only for the waterbody in which [floating solar] is deployed but also in the broader context of trade-offs of shifting energy production from land to water,” the study’s authors wrote.

“Any energy technology has its tradeoffs,” Joshi said, and in the case of floating solar, some of its benefits—reduced evaporation and land use—may not be easy to express in dollars and cents.

Silver Buckshot

There is perhaps no bigger champion for floating solar in the West than Scott Young. Before he retired in 2016, he spent much of his 18 years working for the Nevada Legislature researching the effects of proposed legislation, especially in the energy sector.

On an overcast, blustery May day in southwest Wyoming near his home, Young said that in the past two years he has promoted the technology to Colorado River negotiators, members of Congress, environmental groups and other water managers from the seven basin states, all of whom he has implored to consider the virtues of floating solar arrays on Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa. He stressed that he does not have any ties to industry; he is just a concerned Westerner who wants to diversify the region’s energy mix and save as much water as possible.

But so far, when he has been able to get someone’s attention, Young said his pitch has been met with tepid interest. “Usually the response is: ‘Eh, that’s kind of interesting,’” said Young, dressed in a black jacket, a maroon button-down shirt and a matching ball cap that framed his round, open face. “But there’s no follow-up.”

The Bureau of Reclamation “has not received any formal proposals for floating solar on its reservoirs,” said an agency spokesperson, who added that the bureau has been monitoring the technology.

In a 2021 paper published with NREL, Reclamation estimated that floating solar on its reservoirs could generate approximately 1.5 terawatts of electricity, enough to power about 100 million homes. But, in addition to potentially interfering with recreation, aquatic life and water safety, floating solar’s effect on evaporation proved difficult to model broadly.

So many environmental factors determine how water is lost or consumed in a reservoir—solar intensity, wind, humidity, lake circulation, water depth and temperature—that the study’s authors concluded Reclamation “should be wary of contractors’ claims of evaporation savings” without site-specific studies. Those same factors affect the panels’ efficiency, and in turn, how much hydropower would need to be generated from the reservoir they cover.

The report also showed the Colorado River was ripe with floating solar potential—more than any other basin in the West. That’s particularly true in the Upper Basin, where Young has been heartened by Colorado’s approach to the technology.

In 2023, the state passed a law requiring several agencies to study the use of floating solar. Last December, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published its findings, and estimated that the state could save up to 407,000 acre feet of water by deploying floating solar on certain reservoirs. An acre foot covers one acre with a foot of water, or 325,851 gallons, just about three year’s worth of water for a family of four.

When Young saw the Colorado study quantifying savings from floating solar, he felt hopeful. “407,000 acre feet from one state,” he said. “I was hoping that would catch people’s attention.”

Saving that much water would require using over 100,000 acres of surface water, said Cole Bedford, the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s chief operating officer, in an email. “On some of these reservoirs a [floating solar] system would diminish the recreational value such that it would not be appropriate,” he said. “On others, recreation, power generation, and water savings could be balanced.”

Colorado is not planning to develop another project in the wake of this study, and Bedford said that the technology is not a silver bullet solution for Colorado River negotiations.

“While floating solar is one tool in the toolkit for water conservation, the only true solution to the challenges facing the Colorado River Basin is a shift to supply-driven, sustainable uses and operations,” he said.

Some of the West’s largest and driest cities, like Phoenix and Denver, ferry Colorado River water to residents hundreds of miles away from the basin using a web of infrastructure that must reliably operate in unforgiving terrain. Like their counterparts at the state level, water managers in these cities have heard floatovoltaics floated before, but they say the technology is currently too immature and costly to be deployed in the U.S.

In Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) delivers much of the Colorado River water used by Phoenix, Tucson, tribes and other southern Arizona communities with a 336-mile canal running through the desert, and Lake Pleasant, the company’s 811,784-acre-foot reservoir.

Though CAP is following GRIC’s deployment of solar over canals, it has no immediate plans to build solar over its canal, or Lake Pleasant, according to Darrin Francom, CAP’s assistant general manager for operations, power, engineering and maintenance, in part because the city of Peoria technically owns the surface water.

Covering the whole canal with solar to save the 4,000 acre feet that evaporates from it could be prohibitively expensive for CAP. “The dollar cost per that acre foot [saved] is going to be in the tens of, you know, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Francom said, mainly due to working with novel equipment and construction methods. “Ultimately,” he continued, “those costs are going to be borne by our ratepayers,” which gives CAP reason to pursue other lower-cost ways to save water, like conservation programs, or to seek new sources.

The increased costs associated with building solar panels on water instead of on land has made such projects unpalatable to Denver Water, Colorado’s largest water utility, which moves water out of the Colorado River Basin and through the Rocky Mountains to customers on the Front Range. “Floating solar doesn’t pencil out for us for many reasons,” said Todd Hartman, a company spokesperson. “Were we to add more solar resources—which we are considering—we have abundant land-based options.”

GRIC spent about $5.6 million, financed with Inflation Reduction Act grants, to construct 3,000 feet of solar over a canal, according to David DeJong, project director for the community’s irrigation district.

“If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

— Scott Young, former Nevada policy analyst

Young is aware there is no single solution to the problems plaguing the Colorado River Basin, and he knows floating solar is not a perfect technology. Instead, he thinks of it as a “silver buckshot,” he said, borrowing a term from John Entsminger, general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority—a technology that can be deployed alongside a constellation of behavioral changes to help keep the Colorado River alive.

Given the duration and intensity of the drought in the West and the growing demand for water and clean energy, Young believes the U.S. needs to act now to embed this technology into the fabric of Western water management going forward.

As drought in the West intensifies, “I think more lawmakers are going to look at this,” he said. “If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

“We’re Not Going to Know Until We Try”

If all goes according to plan, GRIC’s West Side Reservoir will be finished and ready to store Colorado River water by the end of July. The community wants to cover just under 60 percent of the lake’s surface area with floating solar.

“Do we know for a fact that this is going to be 100 percent effective and foolproof? No,” said DeJong, GRIC’s project director for its irrigation district. “But we’re not going to know until we try.”

GRIC’s panels will have a few things going for them that projects on lakes Mead or Powell probably wouldn’t. West Side Reservoir will not be open to recreation, limiting the panels’ impacts on people. And the community already has the funds—Inflation Reduction Act grants and some of its own money—to pay for the project.

But GRIC’s solar ambitions may be threatened by the hostile posture toward solar and wind energy from the White House and congressional Republicans, and the project is vulnerable to an increasingly volatile economy. Since retaking office, President Donald Trump, aided by billionaire Elon Musk, has made deep cuts in renewable energy grants at the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear whether or to what extent the Bureau of Reclamation has slashed its grant programs.

“Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the Department is working to cut bureaucratic waste and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently,” said a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees Reclamation. “This includes ensuring Bureau of Reclamation projects that use funds from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act align with administration priorities. Projects are being individually assessed by period of performance, criticality, and other criteria. Projects have been approved for obligation under this process so that critical work can continue.”

And Trump’s tariffs could cause costs to balloon beyond the community’s budget, which could either reduce the size of the array or cause delays in soliciting proposals, DeJong said.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology.”

— GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis

While the community will study the panels over canals to understand the water’s effects on solar panel efficiency, it won’t do similar research on the panels on West Side Reservoir, though DeJong said they have been in touch with NREL about studying them. The enterprise will be part of the system that may one day offset all the electrical demand and carbon footprint of GRIC’s irrigation system.

“The community, they love these types of innovative projects. I love these innovative projects,” said GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis, standing in front of the canals in April. Lewis had his dark hair pulled back in a long ponytail and wore a blue button down that matched the color of the sky.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology,” he said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team for getting this done.”

DeJong feels plenty of other water managers across the West could learn from what is happening at GRIC. In fact, the West Side Reservoir was intentionally constructed near Interstate 10 so that people driving by on the highway could one day see the floating solar the community intends to build there, DeJong said.

“It could be a paradigm shift in the Western United States,” he said. “We recognize all of the projects we’re doing are pilot projects. None of them are large scale. But it’s the beginning.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/041925_Bolster_AZ_019-1024x679.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 08:00:53.026605

With planned investments and timely implementation, the country can steer its power and energy sectors in the right direction and meet its renewable energy targets.","Bangladesh’s interim government is preparing to unveil its first budget on 2 June 2025 amid high expectations of a balanced allocation of funds to streamline the country’s energy transition. A prudent budgetary assessment by the government is much needed given that the power sector’s subsidy burden is reportedly expected to soar by 55% year-on-year in the fiscal year (FY) 2024-25. This is despite the electricity price hike by more than 20% between January 2023 and February 2024.

Bangladesh should follow a merit order dispatch – using the lowest-cost power sources first and then moving to the more expensive ones if demand increases – to bring down its subsidy burden. This opens up opportunities for government intervention – supporting renewable energy capacity addition to ease the transition from oil-fired power and investing in grid modernisation.

Furthermore, the system loss in Bangladesh’s gas sector, which hovers around 7%, calls for budgetary support to revamp gas distribution networks.

While Bangladesh will need a long-term strategy to stave off its energy and power sector challenges, the next budget can lay the foundation for an orderly transition.

Reducing the Power Sector’s Subsidies

Bangladesh needs to gradually reduce oil-fired power generation to limit subsidies. To do this, the government should incentivise renewable energy expansion through budgetary support.

i. Limiting the share of oil-fired power in total generation

In FY2023-24, the cost of oil-fired power was more than two times compared to the average power generation cost. If purchases from oil-fired plants are excluded, the average generation cost comes down to Tk9.54/kWh (US$0.078/kWh). In turn, this can lower the sector’s subsidies.

Earlier this year, the government initiated steps to reduce the share of oil-fired power in total power generation. After a temporary decline in January 2025, the share of oil-based power generation rebounded between February and April 2025, contributing to 10.27% of grid-based power and 29.27% of total fuel costs (Figure 1 highlights the days when the share of oil-fired power was considerably high). This pattern mirrors the trend seen in 2024.

The Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) should strive to reduce oil-based power generation from FY2025-26, based on the estimates of the Bangladesh Power Development Board. As the Ministry of Finance allocates sectoral subsidies, this assessment will help the MPEMR and the Ministry of Finance to phase down power sector subsidies.

ii. Incentivising renewable energy uptake

With declining costs and improving technologies, Bangladesh can lower its overall power purchase cost by deploying cheaper renewable energy. However, since the utility-scale projects’ pipeline is empty and land acquisition poses a challenge, the upcoming budget can allocate part of the Public-Private-Partnership fund to support land acquisition and attract private investment.

Further, the government can provide a duty waiver on imported accessories to incentivise rooftop solar and solar irrigation expansion as quickfire solutions.

As solar irrigation systems are not viable without a grant of around 50% of the capital cost, the government can enlarge the renewable energy funding base of Tk1 billion (US$8.2 million) established in last year’s budget, and allocate a part of it as viability gap funding for the accelerated implementation of solar irrigation projects. The government can let the Infrastructure Development Company Limited, which has significant experience in financing solar irrigation, utilise this subsidy. With this support, microfinance institutions working in rural areas can also scale up solar irrigation projects.

These steps will help the country achieve its goals of attaining 6,145 megawatts (MW) and 17,470MW of renewable energy by 2030 and 2041, respectively, as set out in the Renewable Energy Policy 2025.

Supporting Grid Modernisation

As Bangladesh’s variable renewable energy capacity is likely to surge in the next five years, the old electricity grid becomes a bottleneck. With a greater share of variable renewable energy, old grid may experience stability issues.

While the previous budget allocated Tk10,634 crore (US$0.87 billion) for grid expansion and modernisation, and the development of power evacuation systems, the new budget should continue to fund grid modernisation.

Bringing Down the Gas Sector’s System Loss

Bangladesh could not utilise 68.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas in 2024 due to a system loss of 7% (total consumption recorded in 2024 was 980Bcf) resulting from old pipelines in the gas distribution network and pilferage. By limiting the gas sector’s system loss to 2% from 7%, Bangladesh can save at least 49Bcf of gas per annum (5% of the 980Bcf consumed in 2024), reducing LNG imports worth US$497 million per annum (taking an LNG price of US$10.5/metric million British thermal units (MMBtu)). Prudent budgetary allocation can help the country’s gas distribution companies invest in replacing old gas pipelines. Besides, the country should deploy a team to monitor gas pilferage, which also contributes to system loss. As the country’s fossil fuel imports continue to swell, budgetary support to reduce this system loss is crucial.

The sustainability of Bangladesh’s energy and power sectors hinges on strategic budgetary allocation.

Musk’s exit raises questions about Tesla’s sales slump and competition

SpaceX faces setbacks with rocket program

Musk’s focus shifts to robotaxi launch

Tesla shares down 25% since December

By Aditya Soni, Kritika Lamba

May 29 (Reuters) – Elon Musk’s break with the Trump administration means investors will hope he refocuses on his sprawling empire as Tesla TSLA.O battles slumping sales and after SpaceX’s latest rocket launch fell short of expectations.

Musk called time on his White House stint on Wednesday, giving Tesla investors some succor after shares slumped this year in part due to the backlash to his support of U.S. President Donald Trump and right-wing parties in Europe. The billionaire also spearheaded Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, charged with cutting federal spending, which generated controversy.

He now returns to his empire facing several challenges, but also numerous advantages. Tesla’s sales slide is testing investor patience, yet SpaceX and Starlink dominate their respective markets, often serving as the default choice for commercial launches and satellite internet deployment. Foreign governments have also increasingly looked to Starlink, with regulatory approvals smoothed by Musk’s close ties to Trump.

That relationship, however, has drawn scrutiny. Shortly before he announced his exit from Washington, Musk criticized the tax bill that is making its way through Congress. In addition, he had recently pledged to spend less money on politics after he plunked down nearly $300 million on Trump’s presidential campaign and on other Republican candidates last year.

Tesla shares were little changed in afternoon trading on Thursday, but they have lost about 25% of their value since mid-December. The stock initially soared due to Musk’s relationship with Trump and expectations for swift regulatory approval for the company’s widely awaited robotaxis. They reversed course as sales dropped and protests erupted against Musk’s embrace of far-right politicians and his role in firing U.S. federal workers.

Analysts say deeper operational fixes are needed to reverse its sales slump, however, as EV buyers increasingly seek out competitors, particularly in the fast-growing Chinese market.

“Musk’s departure from DOGE will improve market sentiment, but I see no real change for Tesla,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.

“Tesla’s deliveries decline shows its current product lineup is at market saturation and facing strong competition in all three key markets of the U.S., China and Europe.”

With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 165, according to LSEG data, Tesla remains far more expensive than other Big Tech giants like Nvidia NVDA.O or Microsoft MSFT.O, not to mention conventional auto companies. Bullish analysts, such as Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have long contended that Tesla’s future value is tied to autonomous driving, which Ives said on Thursday could be worth about “$1 trillion alone for Tesla.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP

Musk’s companies have benefited from his relationship with Trump. Reuters reported last week that Musk’s DOGE team was expanding use of his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok in the U.S. federal government to analyze data. Experts told Reuters that this could give Musk access to valuable nonpublic federal contracting data at agencies with which he privately does business, and give him an advantage over other AI service providers.

Trump’s cabinet will continue to work with DOGE employees across various federal agencies, the White House said on Thursday, even as at least one member of Musk’s team was set to depart. Steve Davis, a close associate of Musk and key in running the agency’s day-to-day operations, has stepped down from his DOGE leadership role, according to a source familiar with the matter.

SpaceX’s launch this week failed more quickly than expected, exploding over the Indian Ocean without achieving some of its most important testing goals. The result puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for the rocket, which is bound to play a central role in the U.S. space program. Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a license for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping an investigation of a mishap that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.

SpaceX has long had its own management team led by Gwynne Shotwell, though after the latest launch, Musk said he planned to spend more time on the company. The Starship rocket is still many steps away from being able to land humans on the moon or Mars.

“He’s not an official part of the government, but obviously maintains connections,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla investor Globalt Investments. “So I think there’s a slight diminishment of influence at the margin, but I don’t think it’s going to move the needle on regulatory matters anyway.”

Musk has been quiet for months about legislation in Congress that takes aim at electric vehicles, but late on Wednesday, Tesla Energy criticized Republican plans to end energy tax credits. “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” Tesla Energy wrote on its X account. The Republican tax plan could cut tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases and leases, phase out battery production credits and cut clean-energy incentives for solar.

Tesla’s robotaxi launch next month is crucial to Musk’s plan to shift focus from an affordable electric vehicle to autonomous vehicles and the company’s Optimus humanoid robots.

Shortly after news of his Washington departure, Musk said Tesla has been testing driverless Model Y cars in Austin, Texas, with plans to deliver the first vehicles in June.",https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tesla-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:35.270669

This latest study finding needs to be a point of concern for Indonesia, which is currently beginning to shift to electric vehicles but has not yet been accompanied by an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

A study by researchers from the University of Auckland and Xiamen University in China, published in the February 2025 issue of the journal Energy, shows that carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in a country that switches to electric vehicles (EVs) actually increase if the country's electricity source still relies on fossil fuels. The report was written by Miaomiao Tao and Stephen Poletti from the Energy Centre, Department of Economics, Business School, The University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Boqiang Lin from the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy, Xiamen University, China.

Tao, a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Poletti, stated in a release issued by his university on Wednesday (9/4/2025) that data indicates the increasing use of electricity worldwide has not led to a significant reduction in global CO₂ emissions. ""On the contrary, the adoption of electric vehicles is positively correlated with CO₂ emissions,"" said Tao.

He acknowledged that this finding appears to contradict previous intuition. This discovery, he stated, challenges the common belief that electric vehicles contribute to decarbonization.

In this study, researchers analyzed the environmental impact of human activities and used a statistical approach to investigate the drivers of CO₂ emission increases in a country. Using data from 26 countries over 15 years, they found a trend indicating that higher EV usage is associated with increased CO₂ emissions. The reason is that, in several countries, EVs are still powered by electricity generated through the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or oil.

“Our analysis highlights that the environmental benefits of electric vehicles depend on the composition of a country’s power generation mix,” Tao said.

According to this study, New Zealand, where more than 80 percent of its electricity generation comes from renewable energy, is well-positioned to reap the benefits of EVs. ""This research serves as a reminder that transportation decarbonization cannot be done in isolation,"" said Poletti.

On the other hand, according to this study, countries like Indonesia, where in 2022 only about 19.6 percent of its total electricity production came from renewable energy sources, actually experienced an increase in CO₂ emissions due to the rising use of EVs. So far, the contribution of renewable energy in Indonesia primarily comes from hydroelectric power plants, geothermal energy, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, solar and wind energy.

Poleeti explained that if electric vehicles are charged using electricity generated from coal-fired power plants, the CO₂ emissions produced could actually be higher than those from gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. ""In this case, electric vehicles can indirectly contribute to higher emissions compared to modern gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, especially when considering the entire lifecycle from production to disposal,"" he said.

<strong>Renewable power generation</strong>

The study found that the adoption of electric vehicles would only contribute to reducing CO₂ emissions if the global share of renewable electricity generation reached around 48 percent. According to Poleti, renewables, mainly wind, solar and hydro, will only account for a little over 30 percent of the world’s electricity in 2023, so there is still a way to go if the world is serious about reducing CO2 emissions from electric vehicles.

""Electric vehicles are often seen as a magic bullet for climate change, but our results show that this is not the case if the electricity that powers them is not clean,"" Poleti said.

The study concluded that EVs are only environmentally friendly if they are connected to the electricity grid, and government policies should aim to increase the adoption and integration of renewable energy such as solar and hydro. ""This can be achieved by setting ambitious renewable energy targets and providing adequate subsidies such as tax credits to renewable energy producers and consumers,"" he said.

Poletti said investments in smart grids and transmission networks can improve the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy supplies. Therefore, policies should support community-based renewable energy projects, which can increase public acceptance of renewable energy installations.

The researchers further said that eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms could also provide incentives for renewable energy development. “The adoption of electric vehicles could help countries meet climate targets, as long as the energy used to power them is clean,” Tao said.

In addition to electric vehicle use, the researchers examined the impact of economic growth, green technology innovation, renewable energy consumption, and population density on emissions.

They found that economic growth increases emissions, while innovation in green technologies and population density, in the form of denser cities, can help reduce emissions. The use of renewable energy has the most significant emission-reducing effect.",https://assetd.kompas.id/j__XGPr6Yo2sRO0g8lrwXNvc9Og=/fit-in/1024x875/filters:format(webp):quality(80)/https://cdn-dam.kompas.id/images/2025/03/24/9d18096124cdd40d9d94e0957baee3bd-20250324WEN9.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:30.509906

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.

Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.

The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday — near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage — and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.

While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that “recognizes Alaska's unique value.”

Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline — despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.

In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make “energy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,"" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.

“I think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,” he said.

Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.

There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.

Debate over drilling in the refuge — home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife — has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich’in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.

Many North Slope Iñupiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.

Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit “a step in the right direction.”

For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.

The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the “gigantic natural gas pipeline."" He said countries like Japan and South Korea “want to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.” No firm commitments from countries have been made.

The company advancing the project — in partnership with a state corporation — is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.

While Dunleavy has likened Trump’s friendly approach to energy development as “Christmas every day,” Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.

State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9471fb5d-9baa-472e-9682-3b4226058dea/wirestory_d9b2b70f3ada4eab89da303b2a5c745d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-06-01 05:03:00.764119

The order requires BGE to shift recovery of some supply costs to lower-usage months over a six-month period. It means customers will pay less supply costs during the winter and summer, a time when bills are typically higher. However, they'll see an increase in the fall and spring when bills are lower.

The commission said the order will benefit customers by ""flattening costs and help[ing] mitigate excessively high electricity bills during peak months."" The commission originally considered this idea during an April meeting, after which the Commission requested and received proposals to spread costs over four-, six-, and twenty-four-month intervals.

Commission Chair Frederick Hoover said in a statement, ""The Commission took these actions to mitigate the impacts felt by customers as a result of higher-than-expected energy costs, coupled with potential high usage in the coming months.""

In response, BGE wrote in a statement: ""The Commission has decided to shift the recovery of some supply costs caused by last summer's PJM Capacity Auction results to lower-usage months over a six-month period. We will continue working with the Commission and parties to mitigate the impact of higher energy costs for our customers. In accordance with the PSC's order, adjusted residential electric supply rates will go into effect for usage starting June 1.""

The commission adds that they support the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and several other PJM state consumer advocates in a complaint against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint challenges high wholesale capacity prices, arguing that PJM's most recent capacity auction will impose unjust and unreasonable charges on ratepayers.

Electricity prices increase on June 1

BGE said the increase in electricity prices is the result of an unexpected spike in capacity auction prices and the Talen Energy reliability-must-run (RMR) fee. A capacity market auction is a competitive bidding process where power companies promise to make their electricity generation available in the future.

""Generally, Maryland has an acute imbalance between electricity supply and demand from customers,"" said BGE Spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.

He said customers are paying to keep some power plants, set to retire, online.

""Customers have to pay the owner of those power plants, Talen Energy, a certain fee called the reliability-must-run,"" Alexopulos said. ""They're going to have to pay that every month until the power plants retire.""

What is the Talen Energy RMR fee?

The Talen Energy RMR fee refers to the fixed payments made to Talen Energy for continuing to operate its Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner power plants in Maryland, beyond their planned retirement dates.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, pays a fee of $312 per megawatt per day for the Brandon Shores plant, amounting to approximately $145 million annually, along with a $5 million performance incentive. For the H.A. Wagner plant, PJM pays a fee of $137 per megawatt per day, which totals about $35 million per year, plus a $2.5 million performance incentive.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/01/5ce7c964-61b5-464b-8c7e-ecab532d4d47/thumbnail/1200x630/9348b6afe7655fb7052653fac083fd39/power.png?v=15603985a4508c8e7bc83d8e4e73c5d0,N,,2025-06-01 05:02:49.369869

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.
And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.
Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.
""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.","Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to ""drill, baby, drill,"" struck fear into the hearts of climate campaigners, but it was music to the ears of Washington’s fossil fuel lobbyists.

And the US President didn’t waste any time delivering on his promises to Big Oil.

In a dizzying slew of executive orders on his first day in office, Mr Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, rolled back Biden-era clean energy incentives, stripped away environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration and threw a lifeline to America’s dying coal industry.

Leaving no doubt as to the direction of travel, the administration went on to initiate legal action against states over their climate policies, shutter federal climate research offices, scrub information on extreme weather tracking from government websites and even ban the use of paper straws in federal buildings.

""We’re going back to plastic,"" Mr Trump said as he signed the order, ""these things don’t work"".

The president has made no secret of his disdain for renewable energy projects either, calling wind turbines ""stupid"" and ""unsightly"" and freezing approvals for wind and solar projects on federal lands and water.

The administration is now reportedly preparing to eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, which is already the world’s second-largest polluter.

For some analysts, Mr Trump’s policies could sound the death knell for America’s competitiveness in green energy, a field where other countries, like China, are already surging ahead.

""They're really taking a meat axe to the federal government's work, both on the science of climate change and the technology addressing climate change,"" Harvard professor John Holdren, who was science advisor to former President Barack Obama during his two terms, told RTÉ News.

Others, though, welcomed what they saw as the administration shifting focus to America’s own energy security, which they believed would benefit the US in the long term.

Energy security

""I think what we are seeing from President Trump and Republicans in Congress is a strategy that looks to balance a future that has abundant, affordable, reliable and lower emissions energy,"" said Jeremy Harrell, CEO of ClearPath, a conservative-leaning clean energy organisation, based in Washington DC.

Federal programmes were being reevaluated under President Trump to ensure they were ""economically viable"" as well as targeted towards technologies in which the US was in pole position to lead, Mr Harrell said, citing geothermal, nuclear and carbon-capture as examples.

Was this an acknowledgment that the US couldn’t compete with China in sectors like wind and solar, given that China now makes 80% of the world’s solar panels and dominates global wind turbine manufacturing?

There was certainly bi-partisan support in the US Congress, Mr Harrell said, to onshore US energy in an effort ""to reduce reliance on China and Chinese supply chains, and position the US as a technology leader globally, in areas where we have some strategic advantage"".

But other observers felt the moment for asserting any strategic advantage had come and gone.

""It is a travesty that the United States has not taken a leadership position on the clean energy future,"" said Caroline Spears head of Climate Cabinet, which advocates for pro-climate policies at the state and local levels.

She was also sceptical that the United States would be able to boost domestic industry and technology under current conditions.

""The amount of uncertainty and volatility being created is wild,"" said Ms Spears.

And when it comes to massive projects - like nuclear - there was a danger the administration would overpromise and underdeliver, she said.

The push on climate was going to have to come from individual states, she said.

The power of red states

Last week the US House of Representatives passed a major tax bill - dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" - which gutted the clean energy credits established in former President Biden’s signature piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The bill is now on its way to the Senate, where it may well be watered down, experts said.

That’s partly because much of the financial benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act flowed to Republican-voting areas of the country.

Senators of these so-called ""red states"" will be reluctant to legislate against large renewable energy plants that have brought jobs to their constituencies and have proven popular with voters, experts told RTÉ News.

A recent poll carried out by the Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation found that 84 percent of Texans were in favour of renewable energy projects.

Although best known for its Stetson-sporting oil barons, Texas is now the nation’s leading producer of wind and solar power, having outstripped California some years ago.

Nationally, a long-term study carried out by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication showed that more that three quarters of Americans supported renewable energy infrastructure on public land while 66% of people polled wanted a full transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy by mid-century.

All this leads to a degree of unstoppable momentum, analysts said.

""A lot of the progress we have made in the United States on the ground is not going to be reversed through policy changes,"" said Anthony Moffa, law professor at the University of Maine.

The deployment of more renewable energy or electric vehicle adoption are trends that are going to continue, he said, even without federal government incentives.

""Automakers have already invested a significant amount of money and time in developing affordable electric vehicles,"" he said, ""and we're seeing them adopted more and more throughout the United States"".

Indeed, despite the Trump administration’s rollback of the tax credits and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the US power system began producing more electricity from clean energy sources than fossil fuels in March, according to data released by Ember, a think tank.

That trend has continued for the past three months.

Stalling the energy transition

But while progress may not be halted, it’s likely to see a significant slowdown, analysts said.

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.

But this is where individual states can make a difference, Caroline Spears told RTÉ News.

""They can set renewable portfolio standards, for example,"" she said, ""they can create permitting and leasing offices and make it easier to get projects off the ground"".

And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.

""The biggest source of pollution in the country is increasingly transportation,"" she said.

""There's a lot that states can do on electric vehicles and on public transport,"" she said, ""and we're seeing progress and movement there as well"".

Court battles

As with President Trump’s trade tariffs, the US courts have become a major climate battleground too.

In what law professor Anthony Moffa called an ""unprecedented move"", the administration has thrown its weight behind lawsuits brought by fossil fuel companies against state climate policies.

The department of justice, for example, sued New York and Vermont over their climate ""superfund"" laws that would force oil and gas companies to pay into a state fund for clean infrastructure projects.

But similarly, climate campaigners are also using the courts to challenge government policies.

A group of 22 young activists filed a lawsuit in Montana this week arguing that President Trump’s executive orders suppressed climate science and slowed the transition to renewable energy sources in favour of fossil fuels, ""thereby worsening the air pollution and climate conditions that immediately harm and endanger Plaintiffs’ lives and personal security"".

The spokesperson for the plaintiffs 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser said in a statement that the president’s fossil fuel directives were ""a death sentence for my generation"".

""I'm not suing because I want to, I'm suing because I have to,"" she said.

""My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. [President Trump] is waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we're fighting back with the Constitution,"" she said.

Earlier this month, 17 states and Washington DC sued the government over its ban on wind power projects. The White House accused the attorneys general of the states of using ""lawfare"" to thwart President Trump’s agenda.

'Spherically senseless'

But whatever the final legal outcome of the various cases before the courts, cuts to climate research have already caused ""an enormous amount of damage,"" that will outlast this administration, according to John Holdren.

The National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have all seen their budgets slashed, he said.

Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.

Research programs cannot be revived overnight, he said, noting that staff who have been fired may have moved on to other jobs of even other countries.

That early research was the ""seed corn"" from which future practical advances grew, he added.

""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.

This was ""absolutely a case of shooting the country in the foot,"" he told RTÉ News.

""It is what the energy analyst Amory Lovins once called 'spherically senseless,’"" he said.

It’s occurring as the Trump administration pursues the maximization of already record-high oil and gas output while dismantling swaths of Biden’s policies on climate and clean energy.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstration awards for carbon capture and storage and other technologies the department axed include nearly $332 million to a project at Exxon Mobil’s XOM.N Baytown, Texas refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, US in Louisiana, and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company EMN.N in Longview, Texas.

The Baytown award was meant to cut carbon emissions by enabling the use of hydrogen instead of natural gas for the production of ethylene, a feedstock used in producing textiles and plastic resins.

The department said nearly 70% of the awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election day and January 20, Biden’s last day in office.

The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Carbon capture projects aim to help curb climate change by removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide directly from the air or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground. Sometimes the gas is injected into aging oil fields to push out remaining crude.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges.
With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel.
Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.
Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade.","Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/2592/986/204x0/90/32db3eb1-dbaa-4c9b-ae41-edc65ba460a4-AP25150555797830.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:58.253988

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.
It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV.","Once upon a time, the first automobiles, which were referred to at the time as horseless carriages, used internal-combustion engines, but electrically powered automobiles soon became popular in many urban areeas, especially in New York City, and by 1900, accounted for about one-third of all motorized vehicles on the road in the United Staters. These early EVs cost more than gasoline-powered automobiles and had far less range. In addition, they had limited range, with the Electrobat at the bottom of the rankings with 25 miles (40 km), while Standard Electric and Fritchle Electric boasted their vehicles could attain ranges between 80 and 110 miles (129 to 178 km). As a result, in the alternate history universe of „The Two Georges,“ in which the United States never seceded from the British Empire and America got a royal visit from Charles III as one of the other consequences of that, the electric auto became dominant chiefly in the east and northeast, where ample industrial electricity was available, while the steam car was preferred across the rest of the continent.

Plus ça change…

In the 1990s, the first mass-produced, purpose-designed electric vehicle from a major automaker, the General Motors EV-1, was able to travel 55 miles (89 km) on lead–acid battery packs while it could go 105 miles (169 km) on nickel-metal hydride batteries.

Today, the current range champion is the 2025 Lucent Air Grand Touring, which can run 516 miles (830 km) on a full charge. That vehicle has a manufacturer’s suggested list price, or MSRP, of $110,900. By comparison, the 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid can travel at least 516 miles on a tankful of petrol, while its MSRP is $23,585. A car buyer can purchase almost five of the Toyotas for what one Lucid Air Grand Touring would cost.

This notwithstanding, when General Motors announced that it had cracked the chemistry of lower-cost, energy-dense electric vehicle batteries just two weeks ago, many groups— from other automakers to clean-energy advocates in the United States to automobile buyers who wanted an EV but felt the “tax they would have to pay for the privilege wasn’t worth the price of tea leaes in Boston Harbor“—held their collective breath.

Please keep your eye on the bouncing battery and remember that current GM truck and SUV batteries use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum, while entry-level variants of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y as well as the Ford Mustang Mach E use LFP battery packs.

It was just two weeks ago that the General said that it will begin to use lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, battery cells to power its largest electric vehicles, the SUVs and full-size trucks sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions, would begin pilot production of the cells in 2027, with full production slated to be conducted at a site not yet disclosed.

LMR batteries use significantly less nickel and cobalt, substituting more manganese, which is far less expensive that copper or cobalt and far more abundant, than do other types of vehicle batteries.

Few expected the other shoe to drop so quickly, and y’all better get out of the way, as even more shoes may be dropping soon enough, more than in a grim Grimm’s Fairy Tale, if this week’s news is only the beginning.

In an entry that most certainly falls into the “But wait! There’s more!” category, the Korean Economic Daily reported on Tuesday that the General’s two main battery suppliers are indeed planning to bring LFP battery production to the home of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet.

But wait, what about the General’s plans to produce LMR battery cells in partnership with GM Ultium partner LG Energy Solutions? Let’s not complicate things with the facts, especially because the vehicles the LMR batteries are destined to go into are larger, heavier, and at the upper-end of what remains of the once elegant GM pecking order that ran Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

Now, back to the LFP announcement. If the timing remains in their favor, the GM partnership LFP plants will be among the first of their kind to open in the United States, as it seems unlikely at this point that Ford’s CATL-backed LFP battery production plant will in fact open next year as originally had been planned.

The Samsung SDI/GM joint venture plant in New Carlisle, Indiana is slated to start manufacturing prismatic cells by early 2027—but again under the “But Wait! There’s more!” subheading, Samsung SDI has already indicated it will refrofit part of the plant to turn out LFP cells, and the company is hot on the trail of the required raw materials and the necessary production equpment.

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.

For what it’s worth, the General has been mum on much about these plans. It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV. We’ll need to get Ron “Ronco” Popeil to fill us in on that in the near future.

Confused? So are we, but here’s the old lady who lives in a shoe to comment on the news…

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed Act 96 into law Tuesday, effectively approving a tax — also known as the “Green Fee” — which is the first of its kind in the nation.

“I hope the world is watching because having something that is a balance between industry and environment is gonna be the way to go forward to protect our people […],” Green said. “And most importantly, to protect the lifestyles and the lives we want our children to have for generations to come.”

The law now increases the the state’s Transient Accommodation Tax (TAT) by .75%, to 11%. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and cruise ships that dock in Hawaii.

To break that down, for every $400 spent, $3 will go towards natural resource protection.

The bill is projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment.

“The visitor industry will struggle if we do not take action now,” said State Rep. Adrian Tam, chair of the House Committee on Tourism.

Unlike other state programs, the money generated won’t go into a dedicated special fund. Instead, the legislature will reevaluate priorities each year to decide where the money should go based on the greatest environmental need.

The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

The Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi, a longtime opponent of the bill, argues that it could end up hurting more than it helps.

“There’s nothing like a Hawaiʻi vacation and that is 100% true. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t affect visitor spending and the attractiveness of the Hawaiʻi as a destination,” said Malia Hill, policy director at the Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi.

They argue the fee won’t just fall on tourists, it will also impact local residents and small businesses.

“We travel interisland, for work, to see family, to see friends. So it is a tax on locals, and you cannot get away from that,” Hill said.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

“Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,” said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the “new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

“I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,” said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation’s energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world’s largest wind and solar power farms.

“We’ve seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,” said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India’s total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 — driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

“India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can’t keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

Canadian wildfire smoke has reached Illinois as of Friday, May 30, 2025.

Currently, smoke models are projecting an increase in fine particulates to northern Illinois Friday afternoon that will sweep southeast through Illinois during the evening and overnight hours.

Some smoke may linger into Saturday morning with a gradual decrease from northeast Illinois towards central Illinois throughout the day.

Another round of smoke is possible just to the west of Illinois on Sunday that is being monitored closely.

AirNow NowCast AQI may show Orange or “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” (USG) or higher levels to indicate higher hourly periods.

The daily Air Quality Index (AQI) for Friday is currently forecasted to be in the Yellow or “Moderate” category for most Illinois sectors.

Some sectors in the Chicago area have been downgraded to a USG AQI forecast for Friday.

Residents are encouraged to monitor local air quality and air quality forecasts using the latest information on AirNow.gov.

Particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, can cause serious health problems, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and early death. Those most at risk are people with respiratory or pulmonary disorders, as well as children and adults who are active outdoors. Sensitive individuals should follow their doctor’s advice. Some symptoms to look out for include wheezing, coughing, a fast heartbeat, tiredness, chest pain and shortness of breath. If symptoms worsen, call your physician or 911.?

Illinois Department of Public Health encourages residents to take the following actions to protect themselves when air quality is Red or “Unhealthy” AQI category:

Stay indoors and monitor your breathing, especially if you have heart or lung disease, and keep windows and doors closed.

If your air conditioner has a fresh air intake, set your system to recirculate or close the intake.

Use high efficiency filters in air conditioning systems and portable air cleaners.

Avoid activities that create more particulate matter indoors, like smoking or burning candles.

If you cannot avoid working or other outdoors activities, choose shorter or less intense activities, considering rescheduling, and take more frequent breaks.

Consider wearing a high-quality N-95 or N-100 mask while outdoors.

But their anticipated savings could shrink if Congress approves cuts to clean energy incentives in the upcoming budget.

Pennsylvania's Solar for Schools program was designed to help schools afford to switch to solar and take advantage of federal clean energy incentives approved by the Biden administration.

For the first year of the program, the state awarded $22.6 million to 74 schools statewide, 17 of which are in Western Pennsylvania. Energy bills are a big share of a school's expenses, but the upfront cost of installing solar panels can be prohibitive.

Clairton City School District is getting $361,990 to install rooftop solar panels. The nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, which is helping the district navigate the process, estimates Clairton could save 45% — or $35,000 — on its annual energy bills with the planned 393 kilowatt solar array.

""This will allow us to put money directly into classrooms, helping us improve academic programs, increasing our student attendance, and building a stronger school culture,"" said Clairton Superintendent Tamara Allen-Thomas during a news conference Thursday.

She added the project will also lower emissions from energy use and create local clean energy jobs.

""It's good for our kids, good for our economy, and good for our planet,"" Allen-Thomas said.

Clairton and other Mon Valley communities are burdened by high pollution levels from nearby heavy industry, including U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works. The plant is the largest producer of high-grade coke used for steelmaking in the Western Hemisphere and the largest single source of hydrogen sulfide emissions in the state.

Through lowered bills and federal clean energy tax credits, Clairton School District could save $1.5 million over the next three decades, according to Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center.

But that figure is at risk.

""Without the federal benefits — which Congress is now considering abruptly ending at the end of this year — it could reduce the savings in Clairton and other schools by almost a third,"" Pillar said.

Last week, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a spending plan that would phase out clean energy tax credits ahead of the schedule set in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Though public schools are not eligible for tax credits in the same way as a business or individual, schools can still benefit from an ""elective pay option,"" which allows them to get a direct payment from the government for the value of the credit.

The budget bill is now before the U.S. Senate.

U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), whose 12th congressional district covers Clairton, said programs like Solar for Schools and federal incentives allow schools to reinvest savings in academics, as well as safeguard students' health.

Pittsburgh School of Law, US, Sofia Jenkins",,,,,https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/05/us-supreme-court-narrows-scope-of-environmental-review-of-major-infrastructure-projects/,"The US Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s decision involving the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) on Thursday, effectively narrowing the scope of the statute’s required environmental review of major infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court in this case was asked to review a lower court decision from the US Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

The NEPA is an environmental impact review statute that was promulgated in the 1970s, along with a slew of other environmental protection statutes like the Clean Air Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Unlike these two statutes, the NEPA is procedural. The statute merely requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS) that must address the significant environmental effects of a proposed project and propose alternative measures to mitigate these effects. There is no particular way the statute says that an agency must review the environmental impacts, that discretion in manner is left to the agencies to do as they see fit.

The Supreme Court in this case was asked to review a lower court decision from the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which found that the US Surface Transportation Board (Board) did not produce an EIS that sufficiently analyzed all of the potential environmental effects of a project proposed by seven Utah counties. The proposed project concerned the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah that would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network.

The lower court specifically stated that the Board did not analyze the potential upstream and downstream effects of the oil drilling in the Basin. The court reversed this notion in a majority decision. Justice Kavanaugh, in the majority opinion joined by the four other conservative members of the Court, stated that:

First, the D. C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases. Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line. But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue. Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so.

Justice Kavanaugh continued by rejecting the petitioners’ attempt to use the NEPA as a way to air their policy disagreements with the construction of the proposed railroad. He concluded the opinion by stating, “[c]itizens may not enlist the federal courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand.” The three liberal justices stated in a concurring opinion written by Justice Sotomayor agreed with the approval of the project, but stated that they would have taken a narrower path grounded in case precedent.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/Mining_gilsonite_Cowboy_Dike_north_of_Bonanza_Utah_USA_4.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 23:01:15.558979

Will it work out this time? - The Times,"Ben Spencer, Science Editor",,,,,https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/energy/article/british-nuclear-energy-what-went-wrong-future-wx2qtxqnd,"Why, one wonders, is it so fiendishly difficult to build nuclear power stations in this country?
The world’s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, opened at Sellafield in Cumbria in 1956.
Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.” Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it.
The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.
At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome.","Yet only one of those stations was ever built: Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast. It was switched on in 1995. Britain hasn’t completed a station since.

This failure is not down to a lack of ambition. Thirty years after the hubris of Howell, Ed Miliband, during his first stint as energy secretary, again announced ten new power stations. When he re-entered the energy department last summer, another 15 years later, construction had started on only one: Hinkley Point C.

Overbudget and overschedule, the Somerset station is now expected to be completed in 2031. With an estimated final price tag of £46 billion, it will be the most expensive power project the world has seen.

On June 11, Milliband will confirm £2.7 billion of funding for Sizewell C, in Suffolk, where ground preparation has begun. He will also announce a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs) — factory-built miniature nuclear power generators that are seen by many as the future of the sector.

SMRs will cost a fraction of the price and take a fraction of the time to build, and by the early 2030s will be sending vital power into our homes … in theory. Nobody in Britain, or indeed anywhere else, has even built a prototype SMR.

Why, one wonders, is it so fiendishly difficult to build nuclear power stations in this country? With the sector’s questionable safety record and such eye-watering costs, to be met through our energy bills, do we even need new nuclear power?

Out of energy

In the five decades between Howell and Miliband, nuclear has been widely viewed as a silver bullet to solve Britain’s energy conundrum. Backers say it will underpin intermittent wind and solar and diminish our dependency on petrostates such as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

At one point, Britain led the way when it came to nuclear power. The world’s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, opened at Sellafield in Cumbria in 1956. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new stations sprang up from Dungeness to Torness, Anglesey to Hartlepool. For decades, those stations provided the baseload that underpinned Britain’s power system.

In 1997, there were 17 stations in operation, providing 27 per cent of the UK’s electricity. But when cheap gas was discovered in the North Sea, triggering the 1990s “dash for gas”, the newly privatised energy sector all but gave up on nuclear. Today only five of our ageing nuclear power stations are still operating in Britain — and four of them are scheduled to close by 2030, having already had their lifespans extended.

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan contributed to the slowdown — not only in the UK but worldwide — adding to lingering fears from the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown in the US and 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe in Ukraine. Environmentalists in the past have viewed nuclear power as not only dangerous and expensive but also potentially polluting — the half-life of uranium-235, the fuel used in most reactors, is 700 million years, and nobody has yet figured out how to safely store it.

Undeterred by such niggles, Miliband is now preparing to relaunch our nuclear sector once again, saying: “We are shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations of all types across the country, ending the status quo and building a nuclear resurgence here in Britain.”

‘The penny is dropping’

We have heard such rhetoric before. This time, however, experts say politicians are acting with a new sense of urgency.

“It’s just dawning on us what it will take to seriously electrify society,” says Tim Gregory, a nuclear chemist at Sellafield and the author of Going Nuclear: How the Atom Will Save the World. “Electric cars, electric heating systems, artificial intelligence — these all use an enormous amount of electricity.”

For advocates of nuclear, the drive to net-zero carbon emissions makes acceleration all the more important. Last year, Britain’s last coal-fired power station closed in the name of lower emissions. By the end of the decade, Labour also wants to eliminate gas, which provides a third of the country’s electricity.

Wind and solar power are being rolled out at speed, but when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, without fossil fuels to fill the gap, blackouts will be a serious threat.

“How do you make those enormous quantities of electricity and achieve net zero at the same time?” Gregory asks. “The penny is dropping: nuclear is a really obvious answer to that.”

Critics in Westminster whisper that Miliband is so wedded to renewables that he does not take nuclear seriously. They point to a left-wing tradition, epitomised by his activist parents Ralph and Marion, that they say puts the energy secretary closer to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament than to Great British Nuclear.

His allies, however, say Miliband’s green conviction is precisely why he is so determined to revive nuclear power.

Miliband explained his reasoning in a 2009 speech to the TUC, saying: “I have to confess to you that I did not grow up in a pro-nuclear family, but the truth is that climate change should change everyone’s view about nuclear power. Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.”

Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it. In most cases it is not climate change but trade wars and actual wars that are driving a flight to self-sufficiency.

China steaming ahead

“In the post-Ukraine, post-Covid era, where we’ve seen energy prices spike and a lot more political instability, there’s a new desire to create energy independence from the outside world,” says Andy Champ, who leads the UK nuclear programme of GE Hitachi, an American-Japanese conglomerate hoping to build Britain’s SMRs.

Many countries are attempting to restart stalled sectors. Since the 1990s, nuclear construction has ground virtually to a halt across the West. France — whose 57 reactors generate 65 per cent of its power, the legacy of a 1970s building spree — last year completed its first new station in 25 years.

In 2023 and 2024, the US built its first new units since 1996, with such steep overruns that the manufacturer, Westinghouse, filed for bankruptcy midway through construction.

But the fears of the past are giving way to a new pragmatism. The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.

Germany, which closed its nuclear programme in the wake of Fukushima, last month ended its long-standing opposition to new European nuclear projects. Denmark, which banned nuclear power in 1985, is also reconsidering its position. Even Japan, which closed most of its reactors after the 2011 disaster, is looking to reopen old stations in a bid to reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Public opposition is melting away worldwide. In America, net support for nuclear power rose from 3 per cent in 1983 to 54 per cent last year. This has coincided with a need for new power for data centres and electricity-hungry artificial intelligence.

US energy planners are keenly aware that America’s great geo-economic rival has steamed ahead. China has more nuclear power under construction than the rest of the world combined. Since 2020 it has started work on 22 new reactors. South Korea is not only building steadily but also exporting its technology, with four new plants completed in the United Arab Emirates since 2021, on time and on budget.

Thinking small may help

There is now an opportunity for Britain to recover momentum. Sizewell C is designed as a replica of Hinkley Point C. But industry insiders say ministers need to act quickly to take advantage of lessons from Somerset.

There are 12,000 people working at Hinkley and another 14,000 people employed across the UK providing services and expertise for the project. Recruiting and training them was expensive and time-consuming. If Sizewell can get going soon, a large bulk of the workforce could, in theory, transfer straight from Somerset to Suffolk. But if there are more delays, they are likely to seek employment in other sectors or overseas.

Finance is another challenge. When work started in 2017, Hinkley Point C was budgeted as a £17 billion project. It will end up costing nearly three times as much.

“The old school of thought was that economies of scale come through building big,” says Champ, who worked for the British government before moving to GE Hitachi. “But you’ve now got to find £40 billion-plus to build one of these things, and you’ve got to wait ten years-plus before you start getting any payback on your loan.”

SMRs could solve this headache. Each of these modules generates roughly 300 megawatts — about a fifth of the output of each of the two giant 1.63 gigawatt reactors at Hinkley Point C. They also take up much less space: one could easily fit on two football pitches, while the Hinkley site covers the equivalent of 245.

Next week Great British Nuclear will announce the winner of a competition to build the UK’s first SMRs, which will also be the world’s first if they get a move on. Four companies are in the running: GE Hitachi, Rolls-Royce, Holtec and a restructured Westinghouse.

Although some politicians talk whimsically of having one of these reactors on every street corner, Champ says this is unlikely to happen, at least in the short term.

Initially, the plan is to build SMRs on existing or decommissioned nuclear sites. Although no location has been confirmed, last year Great British Nuclear bought the former nuclear sites of Wylfa, on Anglesey, and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, both of which have been talked about as SMR sites. Engineers envisage as many as ten SMRs would be built on a single site, creating a station with a total output similar to Hinkley’s.

The key advantage is the financing. SMRs are expected to cost about £3 billion each, less than a tenth of the cost of a full nuclear station. But Champ says: “You’re not going to get the efficiencies [building] just two or three or four. You need to start building 10, 20, 30 of these to really see the advantages.”

If a fleet of miniature nuclear stations does spring up across Britain, a key challenge remains: what to do with the spent fuel and other radioactive waste. Nuclear Waste Services, which is owned by the government, is trying to find a site to dig a huge underground cavern — a “geological waste-disposal” facility — in which to bury radioactive material.

Three potential sites have been identified: two in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire. But even if locals agree to the proposals, it will be the 2050s at the very earliest before such a facility opens. The budget for such a site is estimated at up to £53 billion.

At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome. “We’ve done it before and we can do it again,” he says. “If you solve the energy problem, then you solve the economic problem, the environmental problem, the humanitarian problem. Nuclear power can do that.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fbbad4058-09df-451c-aaa3-3a18a053ab93.jpg?crop=4369%2C2458%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-05-31 22:04:49.610572

The money comes from the Environmental Protection Agency in the form of two grants, the Assessment Grant worth $500,000 and the Cleanup Grant worth more than $713,000, Steve Gugliotta, the city’s director of community development, said.

“These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation,” he said.

The two grants will be used for a few different projects, with the bulk of the cleanup grant going to remediate the old Knox Laundry site, he said.

The facility, which used to sit at 57 North Kellogg Street and 332 East Ferris Street, opened in 1898 as a retail laundry store which was expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, he said.

Between 2006 and 2007, the court ordered the demolition of the building after it had been vacated and condemned because of its deteriorating condition.

“Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment,” he said. “But until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.”

The money will help the city address remaining contamination, more specifically areas where soil has been “impacted above saturation limits,” Gugliotta said.

The Assessment Grant will be used to evaluate two different sites that have been labeled as a brownfield.

“A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant,” the EPA’s website said.

The first of these two brownfields is the former Broadview Hotel located at 29 Public Square, which throughout its time was home to many businesses, including a filling station which dates back to 1927, he said.

The second was the former Tucker’s Printing Company, located on North Cherry Street, which was recently demolished after it had a second fire in 2024, he said.

The site has housed industrial buildings in the past that Gugliotta says have led to environmental concerns.

With any money from these grants, they may have left over sites that will be selected by a Brownfields Inventory, which was put together in 2023 by Kansas State University’s Technical Assistance to Brownfield program, as well as consultants at Terracon, he said.

He said they are anticipating the project to run from Oct. 1, 2025, until Sept. 30, 2029, although that is just an estimate, and the projects may not take that much time.",https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2019/06/cropped-CIProud_2019-1.png?strip=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:55.208924

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/dd4006f5-2944-4003-a4a8-ba33863cd977/20250531T152006/dd4006f5-2944-4003-a4a8-ba33863cd977_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 22:04:59.222687

The proposed legislation, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress,” aims to eliminate tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology, directly impacting Ford’s plans to license technology from Chinese battery giant CATL for the Marshall facility. Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford emphasized the critical role of these tax credits, stating, “The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,” warning that their loss could “imperil” the project.

The BlueOval Battery Park, currently under construction and 60% complete, is a cornerstone of Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) strategy, with production of lithium iron phosphate batteries slated to begin in 2026. The plant is expected to create 1,700 jobs and has already prompted Ford to invest over $450,000 in local community initiatives in Calhoun County. However, the project has faced challenges, including a turbulent EV market that led Ford to scale back its initial $3.5 billion investment to $2.5–$3 billion and reduce job projections from 2,500 to 1,700. The state of Michigan also cut its incentive package from $210 million to $141 million in response to Ford’s downsizing, reflecting the project’s precarious footing amid shifting economic and policy landscapes

The potential loss of federal tax credits adds further uncertainty to the Marshall plant’s future, raising concerns about its economic viability and Ford’s broader EV ambitions. Bill Ford has called the proposed cuts unfair, arguing that changing incentives after significant investments have been made undermines business confidence. With the facility poised to bolster domestic battery production and reduce reliance on imports, its success hinges on stable policy support.

What clean energy projects have been canceled Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan.
Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said.
Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.
Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.","More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump’s pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What clean energy projects have been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Also, we hear from Debbie Kelley, the “pollinator lady.” Hear about local efforts to restore pollinator habitats in south central Indiana.

Migrating birds are the ultimate endurance athletes. Some migratory songbirds weigh no more than a few ounces but fly nonstop across oceans to find food in the winter and nesting sites in the summer. There are more than 300 bird species – including birds of prey, songbirds, waterfowl and shorebirds – that migrate through the Midwest.

They follow the Mississippi Flyway, a superhighway in the sky that broadly traces the Mississippi River, extending north to Canada and south to Central and South America. The flyway encompasses many important Midwest habitats, including the restored bottomland forests along the lower Wabash River in southwestern Indiana and the prairies of Kankakee Sands.

During migration, birds depend on suitable habitats to rest and refuel, just as we need to rest and fill up on long hikes or road trips. North America has lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970, much of that due to habitat loss. By helping to protect and restore vital pit stops along the flyway – in the Midwest and throughout the Americas – we are providing birds and other wildlife with a needed lifeline.

The southwest corner of Indiana, where the Wabash and Ohio rivers flow together, contains perhaps the widest array of habitats in the entire state. Here you will find cypress swamps, oak barrens and oxbow lakes in the big river floodplains, creating a home for many rare plants and animals, as well as providing critical stopover sites for migratory birds.

From a few critically endangered whooping cranes to hundreds of thousands of ducks and geese, the increasing numbers of birds delight birdwatchers, hunters and those of us who just enjoy hearing a warbler’s song outside our window. These birds, and hundreds of other species, are responding to the many conservation efforts to protect and restore area habitat. They also represent the quality of habitat that remains to be protected in southwest Indiana.

Using cutting edge mapping tools to prioritize potential restoration sites, The Nature Conservancy is transforming altered landscapes back to functioning floodplain habitat. Ultimately, greater numbers of migratory birds will utilize the area during their long journeys.

As a part of the larger Mississippi River basin, the Wabash River and its tributaries are a top conservation priority. The Nature Conservancy is focusing on water quality and quantity concerns and are working to reduce the impacts of intensive land use and address habitat loss.

Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States, now powers its more than 400 city-owned buildings – including firehouses, libraries and two major airports – using renewable energy. The shift is expected to slash the Windy City’s carbon emissions by 290,000 metric tons annually, the equivalent of the pollution from 62,000 cars. “Chicago’s efforst are a model for other state and city officials,” says EDF energy policy specialist Curt Stokes. Most of Chicago’s power comes from a massive solar array in central Illinois. Built over the last two years, the solar project created hundreds of new jobs in the state.

Part of the city’s successful transition to clean energy is owed to the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act of 2021, an Illinois law. The act aims to reduce climate pollution while creatinf a clean-energy workforce. Chicago got serious about transitioning to 100% renewable energy during the first Trump administration, when advocates began calling for local climate action in the absence of federal leadership.

“We have a responsibility to lead through climate action that benefits the people and the planer,” says Angela Tovar, Chicago’s chief sustainability officer. “By moving to renewable energy for city operations, we’re moving closer to our goal of making all energy consumed in Chicago renewable by 2035, and ultimately to a more sustainable future for all.”

A group of young people are suing the Trump Administration for prioritizing the use of fossil fuels — and driving up planet-warming emissions. The suit was filed Thursday morning in a Montana federal court. The plaintiffs are twenty-two young people from across the country – including ten of the youth plaintiffs in Montana’s climate case. The state supreme court ruled in their favor last year.

They are now suing over a suite of President Trump’s policies. That includes directives to promote fossil fuel development, exempt coal plants from having to filter toxic air pollution, stop all wind energy development, and defund scientific research on climate change. Trump says the U.S. needs to boost domestic energy production and limit regulations on the industry.

Livingston student Eva Lighthiser is the lead plaintiff- and one of the sixteen young people that sued the state of Montana. “We as young people are inheriting this future that is very uncertain and it is quite scary for us, and we are doing the best that we can to protect and preserve a safe future for ourselves. And I don’t think that’s too much to ask,” Lighthiser said.

She says the Trump administration’s actions will worsen climate change and the harms her generation faces as a result. She says these changes violate her, and the other plaintiff’s rights to life and liberty under the US Constitution. Julia Olson is one of the lawyers on the case, and the head of the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust that’s brought these youth-led climate cases.

“The pollution from fossil fuels, in and of itself, is a danger, but it is truly threatening the life support system that these plaintiffs need to live and grow healthy,” Olson said. They are asking the court to block the Trump policies, and reinstate climate change information and monitoring across government sites.

For more on these credits and the documentation they require, read Tax Credits for Energy-Efficiency Home Improvement in 2025.","If you are mulling installing solar panels on your roof or making other energy-efficient improvements to your home, you may want to act quickly to take advantage of one of two federal income tax credits. First, is the residential clean energy property credit for homeowners who install a power system that uses solar or other renewable energy. Second, is the energy-efficient home improvement credit for homeowners who make smaller energy-saving purchases for their homes.

How long these two credits — which reduce the taxes you owe dollar for dollar — will remain on the books, and what, if any, changes will be made, are currently open questions. On May 22, the House passed its One Big Beautiful Bill that would extend the tax changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that automatically expire at the end of 2025. The bill also provides lots of other tax breaks.

The House's One Big Beautiful Bill would also scale back many of the green energy tax credits that were created, expanded or renewed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act., including the home energy savings tax credits. Specifically, the bill would repeal the residential clean energy property credit and the energy efficient home improvement credit, effective for property placed in service after 2025.

Now it's the Senate's turn. The odds are good that Congress will pass a tax package sometime this summer, despite a series of hurdles that lawmakers will have to overcome. However, the Senate will make some changes to the bill, including possible revisions to the green energy tax credits.

Since homeowners may claim a home energy credit only for the year the improvements are made, if you’re thinking of making any energy-saving upgrades, you’ll want to pay for them and get them completed before December 31 to ensure a tax credit. They should be claimed using IRS Form 5695.

The residential clean energy property credit

This tax break is for homeowners who install an alternative energy system that relies on a renewable energy source, such as solar, wind, geothermal, or fuel cell or battery storage technology. Think solar panels, solar-powered water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, wind turbines, fuel cells, etc. The credit equals 30% of the cost of materials and installation or systems that you install in your home. There is no maximum credit dollar limit for solar, geothermal, wind, or battery storage systems. But for fuel cells, the credit is capped at $500 for each half-kilowatt of power capacity.

Unused residential clean energy property credits can be carried forward to reduce tax owed in future years. Homeowners who install a renewable energy system sometimes qualify for a rebate. These rebates are nontaxable, but they reduce the system’s cost for figuring the credit.

The energy efficient home improvement credit

The basic credit is 30% of the cost and installation of certain types of insulation, boilers, central air-conditioning systems, water heaters, heat pumps, exterior doors and windows, etc., that you install in a home. These items must also meet certain energy-efficiency requirements, depending on the product. There is a $1,200 general aggregate yearly credit limit. But many specific upgrades have lower monetary credit limits and others have higher ones.

Here are the item-by-item yearly caps: $150 for a home-energy audit; $500 in aggregate for exterior doors (a maximum of $250 per door); $600 for exterior windows or skylights, and $600 for natural gas, propane or oil water heaters, electric panels, central air conditioners, or natural gas, propane or oil furnaces or hot water boilers. And $2,000 for biomass stoves or biomass boilers, electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters, or electric or natural gas heat pumps. Unlike the residential clean energy property credit, you cannot carry forward any unused energy-efficient home improvement credits to future years.

As an example, let’s say that in 2025, you purchase and install in your home two exterior doors at a cost of $1,000 each, windows and skylights at a total cost of $2,200, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your 2025 tax credit amount is $1,200. Now, change the facts. In 2025, you purchase and install in your home a natural gas heat pump that costs $7,000, a $4,000 natural gas tankless water heater, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your total maximum credit is $3,200: $2,000 for the heat pump. $600 for the water heater and $600 for the air conditioner.

In a major step towards promoting clean energy in India, IndianOil has finalised the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) for setting up a 10,000 Tonnes Per Annum Green Hydrogen Generation Unit at its Panipat Refinery & Petrochemical Complex.

This project marks IndianOil's entry into the green hydrogen sector and will be the largest green hydrogen initiative in India to date.

The company in a statement on Friday, stated that ""Slated for commissioning by December 2027, the Green Hydrogen produced will replace fossil-derived Hydrogen in refinery operations, resulting in substantial reduction in Carbon emissions"".

The plant is expected to be commissioned by December 2027. The green hydrogen produced at this facility will replace the fossil-fuel-based hydrogen currently used in the refinery's operations.

This transition is expected to significantly cut down carbon emissions, helping IndianOil move towards a more sustainable and environment-friendly model.

The company also added that this initiative is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and forms a critical part of IndianOil's larger decarbonization strategy.

The project also supports the company's Net Zero target and demonstrates its commitment to leading India's shift towards a cleaner and greener energy future.

Earlier, Arvinder Singh Sahney, Chairman of IOC, during an exclusive conversation with at the World Economic Forum 2025 in Davos, Switzerland, stated that the plant, with a production capacity of 10,000 tons per annum, had made substantial progress.

""Green hydrogen plant is now alive. We have got very good bids for it. And now the tenders are under evaluation. And within a month or so, we will be able to award the job, and within two years, that green hydrogen, the 10,000 tons per annum plant at Panipat (Haryana) will be commissioned"" he said.

The plant aims to bolster India's green energy mission, contributing to a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.

With this landmark project, IndianOil further strengthens its leadership in the country's energy transformation journey.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-121535148,imgsize-78424,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etmanufacturing/news/energy/indianoil-finalises-indias-largest-green-hydrogen-project-at-panipat.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 22:04:39.760148

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

With the right currency conversion and a bit of context, the prices seem almost too good to be true, especially when it comes to Zhengzhou Nissan’s Z9 lineup.

Zhengzhou Nissan, the truck-centric branch of the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture, has just expanded the local Z9 lineup with the GE PHEV, a plug-in hybrid that serves as the electrified sibling to the locally-built Nissan Frontier Pro. The company had previously launched gas and diesel-powered versions of the Z9.

Wallet-Friendly Workhorses

The Zhengzhou Nissan Z9 starts at just ¥119,900 (equal to around $16,600 at current exchange rates) for the internal combustion version. If you’re looking for a greener option, the new Z9 GE PHEV kicks off at ¥156,900 ($21,800), still far below what most midsize pickups command elsewhere.

While the Z9 and Frontier Pro may be siblings under the surface, you can tell them apart by their grille and bumper designs. They also sport unique LED lighting signatures at both ends. Beyond that, the bodywork is identical, including the five-seat cabin.

Low Price, High Tech

Inside, the Z9 punches well above its weight for the price. A 12.8-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster come standard. Higher trims step it up with a 14.6-inch touchscreen, Nappa leather seats, and all the modern comforts, including heating, ventilation, massage functions, and a 12-speaker stereo. Tech features extend to four ultrasonic radars, a transparent engine hood camera mode, and four high-def cameras enabling Level 2 driver assistance.

Nissan Frontier Pro

Size and Powertrain Specs

Measuring 5,494 mm long (216.3 inches) with a 3,300 mm (129.9 inches) wheelbase, the Z9 GE PHEV fits squarely into the midsize pickup truck category. It comes exclusively in a dual-cab layout, with seating for five and a 1,520 mm (59.8 inches) long rear bed.

The plug-in hybrid system pairs a turbocharged 1.5-liter gas engine with a single electric motor. Depending on the trim, total output comes to either 322 hp (240 kW) or 429 hp (320 kW), with both versions delivering an impressive 800 Nm (590 lb-ft) of peak torque. Power goes to the rear or all four wheels via an automatic transmission designed specifically for hybrid use.

The PHEV offers two battery options. The least powerful version gets a 17 kWh battery pack, allowing an EV-only range of 60 km (37 miles). For those who want more, the larger 32.85 kWh battery extends the zero-emission range to 135 km (84 miles). As always, keep in mind these numbers are based on the more optimistic NEDC test cycle.

A Serious Bargain Compared to US Offerings

Which brings us to the surprisingly low sticker prices. The base Z9 GE PHEV starts at ¥156,900 ($21,800), while the more powerful variant with the extended EV range is priced at ¥168,900 ($23,400). Even the fully loaded flagship version, complete with all the premium features, tops out at just ¥219,900 ($30,500). For those prioritizing value above all, the entry-level diesel model with a six-speed manual can be had for only ¥119,900 ($16,600).

More: Nissan Confirms Plug-in Hybrid Frontier For America

To put things in perspective, the similarly sized US-market Nissan Frontier starts at $32,050 for the most basic 4×2 King Cab with a non-electrified 3.8-liter V6. That’s nearly double the price of the Z9, without any hint of electrification or standout tech features.

As for EV alternatives, the upcoming Slate is projected to start around $28,000. But the base model skips over even the most basic comforts, like power windows – and paint. It’ll be sold in a single molded-in-color gray, with buyers offered a $500 do-it-yourself wrap kit as the only customization option. Federal incentives could bring the price down to about $20,500, but don’t bank on it. With Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” picking up steam, those generous tax credits may not be around much longer.

Zhengzhou Nissan hasn’t revealed pricing for the Nissan-branded Frontier Pro just yet, but it’s likely to sit slightly above the Z9 GE PHEV. What’s more interesting is that the Nissan-branded truck is also expected to become available in markets outside China, though obviously, not in America. If they manage to keep the pricing in check, it could be a compelling option.

They are reportedly Cybertrucks that the firm hasn't managed to selll yet.

The Cybertruck has been the talk of the town whole world since Elon Musk took it to the stage in Los Angeles for the official unveiling in November 2019, and the carmaker's Head of Design, Franz von Holzhausen, shattered its windows by hitting them with a steel ball and a sledgehammer.

From that moment on, orders started pouring in, and Tesla soon bragged about having collected over one million reservations. It was easy to reserve a truck. All you had to do was place a $100 deposit, which was refundable at any time. Either the one-million-reservation information was fake, or people got their deposits back because the number is nowhere to be seen.

The super-cheap Tesla Cybertruck is nowhere to be seen

Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck on November 30, 2023. The hype skyrocketed as many agreed to spec a Foundation Series, which was a $100,000 deal, in order to skip the line. Elon Musk had announced a starting price of $39,900 in November 2019, but that was before the chip crisis and before the repetitive production delays. It was the time when owners who flipped their Cybertrucks, despite the clause in the purchase contract that restricted them from doing so during the first year of ownership, brought them big money.

A Porsche dealership in Orlando bought a Cybertruck for an incredible $244,000 and listed it for sale days later for $290,000. Little did they know there would come a time when owners wouldn't even be able to get $90,000 for their electric trucks.

Furthermore, since Elon Musk joined Donald Trump's team, an unofficial boycott started against the brand, as Tesla's potential customers decided to resort to other brands, and many owners started trading in or selling their EVs. It is a move from which Cadillac benefits. General Motors has recently revealed that 25% of the customers buying an electric Caddy are former Tesla owners. So much for the brand loyalty that Tesla was bragging about.

Elon Musk departed the White House after publicly criticizing his team and complaining about the bureaucracy he had been dealing with during his 128-day mandate. We have yet to see if the move will impact Tesla's sales.

In the meantime, it seems that the automaker can't sell the Cybertruck, which was, at some point, the world's most anticipated model. The hype built around it in the previous years is now long gone, sales have come crashing down, and depreciation has its way with the model. Tesla sold just 40,000 units in 2024, and it hasn't been doing well this year either.

Tesla was hoping to move 250,000 Cybertrucks last year, but the Ford F-150 Lightning won back its crown as the best-selling electric pickup truck. As Elon Musk overpromised and underdelivered again, the Cybertruck has less range and a higher price than originally announced.

The owner of the property is in trouble

Those are solid reasons that keep customers at bay. Dozens of Cybertrucks stay parked in the parking lot of a shopping center near Detroit. The property owner is obviously in trouble.

He is violating the city code by storing dozens of Teslas in the parking lot located in suburban Detroit, as vehicle storage is not a permitted use of the land. The Teslas have basically taken over the parking spaces of the center, which is on the verge of undergoing a major redevelopment.

While trying to figure out what to do with all the pickups that it builds and is unable to sell, Tesla is storing them wherever it finds room for them. One of the places that accepted to host the firm's trucks was a run-down mall, the Hunter's Square, located in Farmington Hills, outside Detroit, Michigan, which got officials fuming.

Many of the stores that once operated there are now closed, but several fast-food restaurants are still open, which means a relatively reduced number of customers still visit the center. However, the Teslas are currently occupying several rows normally reserved for customers.

Penalizing the owner takes time

Automotive News reports that Charmaine Kettler-Scmult, director of planning and community development for Farmington Hills, Michigan, stated that city officials had already informed the shopping center landlord of the violation and asked him to clear the area. However, enforcing the evacuation procedure is time-consuming.

Tesla recently opened a brand-new showroom near Hunter's Square shopping center in West Bloomfield. The Cybertrucks parked at the mall might have been sourced from the showroom.

The firm is also counting on the single-motor rear-wheel drive Cybertruck to boost sales. The latest version quietly appeared in the online configurator back in April, with a starting price of $69,990. It is still light years away from the $39,900 Cybertruck that Elon Musk promised in November 2019.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-cybertrucks-pile-up-in-detroit-parking-lot-what-are-they-doing-there-252286_1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:27.491169

Foreign representatives visiting Alaska for the discussions in coming days are expected to include representatives from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, India and the United Arab Emirates, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

The US delegation will be led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who’s also the chair of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council; the panel’s vice-chair, Energy Secretary Chris Wright; and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, the people said.

The trip is set to include visits to an oil pipeline and gas processing facilities on Alaska’s North Slope as well as meetings with industry officials and indigenous people, they said.

It comes as Trump moves to expand energy development in the state, a priority he outlined in an executive order hours after his Jan. 20 inauguration. And it coincides with a broad push by other nations to curry favor with the president, including through investment commitments, to ward off threatened tariffs.

Trump has repeatedly touted the $44 billion Alaska LNG project, which is meant to transport natural gas across the state for export. Although it has been planned for decades, the project faces headwinds due to its large price tag, mammoth scale and the sheer challenge of constructing an 800-mile (1,290 kilometers) pipeline across Alaska.

Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the project during their meeting in February, winning his commitment to cooperate on strengthening energy security, “including increasing exports of United States liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner.”

Representatives of the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea also have been in talks with administration officials on the venture.

Discussions are expected to unfold over several days, including during site visits at the prolific Prudhoe Bay oil field, which has pumped crude for roughly five decades, and where units of ConocoPhillips and Hilcorp Energy Co. have operations. Other conversations are expected in Utqiagvik and Anchorage, including as part of Governor Mike Dunleavy’s Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Trump officials see the visit as a chance to highlight the administration’s focus on unleashing Alaska’s energy abundance and draw a contrast with policies under former President Joe Biden they say locked up the state’s oil, gas and mineral potential. While Alaska LNG will be a significant portion of the discussions, a person familiar with the matter said, there’s an opportunity to examine the state’s resource potential and further policy shifts that can help deliver it.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network.
Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost.
Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.
James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy.","Network Rail is set to tap into clean energy from a newly commissioned solar farm in Norfolk, thanks to a landmark deal with EDF Renewables UK. Construction at Bloy’s Grove, just outside Swainsthorpe and within sight of the Great Eastern Main Line, is poised to begin, with the energy generated playing a pivotal role in decarbonising Britain’s railway infrastructure.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network. Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost. This will account for around 15% of the electricity needed to power its offices, depots, and managed stations, collectively referred to as non-traction energy.

To put this in perspective, a single year’s worth of energy under the CPPA would be enough to power London Liverpool Street station for nine years. Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.

Rail Minister Lord Hendy said: “We are working with partners across the rail industry to build a modern transport network with our environmental commitments at the heart. The Government’s Plan for Change is driving economic growth, transitioning the country to sustainable energy, and securing jobs. Under our new integrated approach, we are ensuring the British rail industry remains at the forefront of innovation and improvement.”

The move aligns with Network Rail’s broader Green Strategy, which charts a course toward a more sustainable future for rail travel. The company isn’t stopping here. Plans are underway to secure additional CPPAs to transition all of its non-traction electricity eventually to solar, a significant leap toward full sustainability.

“With the railway industry set to unite under Great British Railways, this contract, our Green Strategy, and a cohesive railway system provide us with even more opportunities to reduce emissions and make our railway even greener.”

Jo Lewington, chief environment and sustainability officer at Network Rail, said: “Travelling by train is already one of the most sustainable ways of getting around, and we know we can do more as a business. In future, we would like all of our office and station power to come from sustainable sources, and this contract is a huge step forward towards that.”

EDF Renewables UK will build, operate, and manage the Bloy’s Grove facility. Over its projected lifespan, the solar farm is expected to offset approximately 60,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of planting more than 2.2 million trees.

And it’s not just the environment that stands to benefit. EDF Renewables has also committed to investing in the local community, pledging £20,000 per year to a community fund for the whole 35-year operational life of the solar project.

James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy. This project shows the importance of technologies such as solar in reducing costs and de-carbonising the UK electricity system to reach the country’s target of net zero by 2050.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_51e599419291474cb78769ba9ac2a9a4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_667,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_51e599419291474cb78769ba9ac2a9a4~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 19:07:27.614532

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said.
The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible.
The assessment for California aviation turbine fuel, which consists of 30% SAF and 70% kerosene jet fuel, was assessed at 4.76/gal.","Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel have announced plans to develop the first on-site sustainable aviation fuel production facility in US.

The facility announced May 29 will be just south of PIT's terminal and is expected to dramatically enhance access to low-carbon jet fuel for commercial and cargo carriers operating in the region.

While other SAF plants operate elsewhere, PIT's facility situated just south of the terminal will be the first integrated within a major airport's infrastructure.

The facility will use KBR's PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and globally licensed by KBR, converting renewable alcohol into jet fuel that meets ASTM certification and global sustainability standards.

KBR's PureSAF technology is an alcohol-to-jet process that converts various feedstocks, including bioethanol, syngas and carbon dioxide, into sustainable aviation fuel.

In addition to processing ethanol, this technology can also convert mixed alcohols, carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, creating pathways for utilizing captured carbon usage.

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. ""With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.""

The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible. This technology is particularly attractive for its ability to utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including waste biomass and biogenic CO2.

Through multiple development phases, the facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, helping to significantly reduce the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Much lower carbon intensity

The SAF produced at PIT will have a carbon intensity at least 65% lower than conventional jet fuel, according to project estimates, contributing meaningfully to the industry's decarbonization goals.

""KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it on-site at the airport,"" Hari Ravindran, KBR's Global SVP for Technology, said. ""PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) technology is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.""

The PIT-Avina initiative aligns with broader efforts across the aviation sector to cut emissions and build resilient fuel infrastructure. As airlines face increasing regulatory and market pressure to decarbonize, projects like this may define the next generation of airport operations and fuel logistics in the US.

Construction is set to begin soon, with phased rollout expected to support regional airline partners and national SAF supply chain expansion.

At a steel mill just outside of Pittsburgh last night, President Trump applauded a potential deal between U.S. Steel Corporation and Japan's Nippon Steel - one that he says would bring billions in investment from the Japanese company.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.

SIMON: Now, Trump had opposed the deal as a candidate but now says it will be good for America and that U.S. Steel will still have an American CEO and a corporate board with a U.S. majority. But he was light on specifics and even admitted later, there is no final deal.

NPR's Don Gonyea's in Pittsburgh. Don, thanks for being with us.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning.

SIMON: What's the reaction in steel country?

GONYEA: I've been in and around Allegheny County these past couple of days, and in West Mifflin, where a key U.S. Steel facility is located. So let's start there with the local mayor. His name is Chris Kelly.

What was your immediate reaction?

CHRIS KELLY: I started to cry. I mean, I've lived this for a year and a half, and I thought, wow, this is - I wasn't expecting it.

GONYEA: And he made it clear that they were tears of joy, he's talking.

SIMON: Did the mayor talk about how his community had been hurt by the decline of U.S. Steel?

GONYEA: Yeah. He's lived it. He grew up in a nearby town, where, he says, it was decades of decline. He says one mill after another closed, and more than 200,000 jobs disappeared.

KELLY: And I saw the devastation that came along with individuals losing their homes and their jobs, their cars, their families - you know, turned to drug abuse, eventually, domestic violences. And I didn't want to see that.

GONYEA: And he sees the new investments from Nippon Steel as new life.

SIMON: And what did people in the community tell you?

GONYEA: Most are only just learning some of the details, but it's welcomed. I met 55-year-old Malik Swain (ph) outside a local restaurant. He said it's good news, including what updating these old mills will mean for the environment.

MALIK SWAIN: I think it's good for the Mon Valley, actually. I think it's going to keep jobs there, grow it. They're also going to upgrade the facility. So I think that's a good thing as far as air quality goes, hopefully.

GONYEA: And then, Scott, I do want to note here that the United Steelworkers - the national union - has long been opposed to Nippon coming in, citing national security and allegations of unfair trade practices.

SIMON: Of course, Don, it's interesting that the president has really increased trade pressure on other countries. What do his supporters say about Nippon Steel - which is, after all, a Japanese company potentially - taking over what was a company that was once such a cornerstone of U.S. manufacturing.

GONYEA: And that was a big reason, during the campaign last year, that both candidate Trump and President Biden opposed this proposed deal with Nippon Steel. Now, though, such concerns seem to be overridden by the prospect of more jobs. But listen to this - I heard this from a local resident. His name is Mike Medich (ph).

MIKE MEDICH: I'm glad it's Japan rather than China because China has a lot of investments in our country, which I don't think they should have.

GONYEA: And I'll add here that Medich doesn't necessarily see this as a big engine for new jobs, but, he says, had this mill closed, that would have been a real blow to the community.

The Road Ahead: A Smarter EV Manufacturing Ecosystem The journey toward fully automated and digitized EV manufacturing in India is just beginning, but the pace is picking up.
Conclusion The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing.","The transition to electric vehicles (EV) in India is not coming — it is existing. As of mid-2025, EV sales were growing at an exceptional rate of greater than 45% annually while government level initiatives that fuel demand and incentives at a program level, such as the PM e-Drive or the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programs, are spurring greater investment in the EV manufacturing space. But manufacturing is not about policy or demand; it is about the merging of automation and Industry 4.0 — in other words, a revolution changing the structure of EV manufacturing at the core.

To create faster, smarter, globally competitive EV manufacturing, India must leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, defined as a network of smart machines, data systems and connected platforms that allows factories to self-monitor, plan, predict and change stipulations in real time.

In this article, we will discuss how Industry 4.0 and automation are reshaping EV manufacturing processes in India and around the world about more efficient production lines, better quality control and more scalable solutions.

Materializing Industry 4.0 in EV Manufacturing

Industry 4.0 sometimes known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution — relates to the digitization of manufacturing using different technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, big data analytics, cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems. When applied to EV manufacturing, it results in smart factories where machines communicate, make decisions, and optimize performance with minimal human intervention.

Leading Indian EV OEMs like Tata Motors, Mahindra Electric, Ola Electric, and Ather Energy are investing heavily in smart production facilities that are equipped with Industry 4.0 frameworks. Automated ecosystems are making possible real-time quality assurance, predictive maintenance, and flexible assembly lines essential to rapid, efficient EV production.

Why is Automation So Important in EV Manufacturing

Unlike traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) have unique requirements – high-voltage batteries (with thermal management), power electronics, and lightweight frames. Because of this complexity and need for greater precision and repeatability, automation is essential to EV manufacturing.

Automation is providing repeatability, speed, and safety in battery module assembly, welding aluminum body frames, winding motors – including for software calibrations! By 2025, robots had become a dominant factor in India’s leading EV manufacturing factories.

For example:

Tata Motors has implemented collaborative robots (cobots) for automated spot welding and battery handling at its Pune facility.

MG Motor India is utilizing advanced AI and machine learning tools, in collaboration with SAIC, to reduce defects in production and human error.

BYD India has applied more than 60% robotic automation in the bus and battery manufacturing units.

These developments indicate a strong movement toward Industry 4.0 ecosystems that will form the future of EV manufacturing in the India.

Key Industry 4.0 Technologies Reshaping EV Manufacturing

1. Digital Twins

Also a digital twin is a virtual real-time copy of a physical asset, or physical business process. In electric vehicle manufacturing, it has allowed engineers to simulate the production process, battery performance, and thermal characteristics of a finished vehicle by modelling aspects such as material performance and operational parameters before actual deployment. Digital twins can allow for reduced time-to-market and real-time remote monitoring of the processes at operational plant locations.

2. IoT and Smart Sensors

IoT sensors situated in machines or along assembly lines, can collect meaningful operational data related to temperature, vibration, energy usage, and torque so that parts can be evaluated for predictive maintenance and can also optimize processes by minimizing downtime and improving operational efficiencies in existing EV manufacturing units.

3. AI and Predictive Analytics

AI systems compute massive amounts of data to predict equipment failures and optimize inventory management, alongside maximizing yield. AI-based vision systems have also been adopted for real-time quality inspection of EV batteries and wiring.

4. Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)

3D printing facilitates iterative development of EV components for prototyping and small-batch requirements like battery enclosures, housings, and custom cooling plates. Many EV manufacturing start-ups are now integrating additive manufacturing as an opportunity to reduce development costs and waste.

5. Cloud and Edge Computing

Data generated on the factory floor is now processed on edge devices for immediate insights, or stored in cloud data platforms for more traditional macro-level analytics. This hybrid system, where data is processed at the edge such as the manufacturing plant and aggregated in the cloud as necessary, allows for faster decision making across geographically dispersed EV manufacturing ecosystems.

Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain Integration

Another significant benefit of Industry 4.0 in EV manufacturing is the creation of smart, connected supply chains. Manufacturers can now track components in real-time, reduce lead times, and synchronize procurement with demand forecasting.

With EV components like lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, and controllers often coming from diverse vendors, a digital supply chain helps reduce delays and avoid overstocking. Companies like Bosch, Bharat Forge, and Sona BLW have integrated smart supply chain platforms to enable seamless component flow into EV manufacturing plants.

Challenges to Adoption in India

While the benefits are immense, India’s EV manufacturing sector still faces hurdles in fully adopting Industry 4.0:

High Capital Expenditure: Setting up smart factories with robotics, AI, and IoT infrastructure involves substantial initial investment.

Workforce Skill Gap: There’s a significant lack of trained technicians, engineers, and operators familiar with Industry 4.0 tools.

Legacy Systems: Many traditional auto manufacturers have outdated ERP systems that are not compatible with modern automation platforms.

Cybersecurity: The connected nature of Industry 4.0 systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, requiring robust data protection protocols.

To overcome these, the government and industry bodies must collaborate on workforce skilling programs, offer tax incentives for tech upgrades, and promote standardized frameworks for smart EV manufacturing.

Government Push and Industry Partnerships

Recognizing the critical role of Industry 4.0 in boosting global competitiveness, the Indian government has included digital transformation under the PLI Auto Scheme. The Ministry of Heavy Industries has announced funding for pilot EV manufacturing projects that demonstrate end-to-end automation and data analytics integration.

Collaborations between OEMs and tech giants like Siemens, ABB, Bosch, and Infosys are also enabling smooth adoption of Industry 4.0 systems in EV assembly lines. Startups like Entuple E-Mobility and Numocity are developing India-specific solutions for real-time energy monitoring and digital diagnostics in EV manufacturing.

The Road Ahead: A Smarter EV Manufacturing Ecosystem

The journey toward fully automated and digitized EV manufacturing in India is just beginning, but the pace is picking up. In 2025, every major EV player is either scaling up its smart factory operations or investing in next-gen digital infrastructure.

The long-term vision is clear — India must become not just an EV consumer market but also a global hub for advanced EV manufacturing. To get there, embracing Industry 4.0 isn’t optional — it’s essential.

From AI-guided robots assembling battery packs to cloud platforms managing plant operations from thousands of kilometers away, the future of EV manufacturing lies in intelligent, interconnected systems. And with the right partnerships, investments, and policy support, India is well-positioned to lead this transformation.

Conclusion

The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing. It offers not just increased productivity and reduced costs, but also ensures higher precision, lower emissions, and scalable growth. As India accelerates toward its clean mobility goals, EV manufacturing powered by Industry 4.0 will be the cornerstone of this new industrial age.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Automation-and-Industry-4.0-in-EV-Manufacturing-Powering-the-Future-of-Mobility-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 19:07:23.310028

""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.

The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.

The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.

While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.

The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.

A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.

Work on spending bills launching

The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.

Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majority

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.

In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always.

Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.

Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.

The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.

Partial shutdown could loom again

Tensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.

Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown.

Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”

“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”

DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”

“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-05/trumprfkmcmahon.jpg?h=0a8b6f8b&itok=uqNRcgly,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:13.515960

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “wavier” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30 percent of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3 percent of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2 percent of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House – the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans – to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat Senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a Senator in the majority and as a Senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

The suit from the service that airs “Sesame Street,” Ken Burns documentaries and the “PBS NewsHour” for free to millions of American homes, said that Congress has repeatedly protected PBS from political interference by filtering its funds through the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which is not a federal agency.

“The [executive order] makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech.”

NPR, which also receives CPB funding, filed a suit on similar grounds on Tuesday.

Kilton Webb is a member of the IBEW Local 567 and a member of the Maine House of Representatives.

As an IBEW member in Maine representing over 4,000 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us. Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs — something at the top of every Mainer’s mind — all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The U.S. House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of many clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

Let’s be clear: This bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in Maine.

I have seen the benefits of clean energy investments myself. I began my career as an electrician, and my first job was on a solar field in Kennebunk. I’ve built dozens of solar farms across the state, a job that has helped me pay off debt, purchase a home, and advance to a journeyman electrician. I am honored to now represent Durham in the Maine House of Representatives.

I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom with companies like Nyle Water Heating Systems here in Maine.

Maine has been a national leader in clean energy generation, with over two-thirds of the state’s total energy generation coming from clean energy, including 27 percent from wind and 13 percent from solar. We will need even more to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, we have already seen how extreme Republican attempts to repeal clean energy are impacting Maine’s energy supply and jobs. In April 2025, Maine’s first planned offshore wind array Pine Tree Offshore Wind paused the project because of President Donald Trump’s opposition to wind energy. This delay is pulling the plug on 144 megawatts of energy, shrinking the state’s energy supply and putting the burden on Maine families.

Repeal of clean energy tax credits will also hurt Maine disproportionately because our rural state has 145 utility-scale projects either operating or in development across the state that could be eligible for these tax credits. That means 9,100 jobs, $8.8 billion in investment, and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage.

The Trump Administration has already arbitrarily attacked Mainers’ access to energy efficient heat pumps that can help bring the costs of heating and cooling our homes under control, even as Maine is embracing them more and more, but now U.S. House Republicans want to immediately repeal all federal tax credits that can help working people lower their energy bills. All of this to cover a small fraction of tax cuts that go primarily to the wealthy — how does that make any sense?

Sen. Susan Collins, who has represented us since 1997, has been a longtime supporter of Maine’s clean energy development. Her support for Form Energy’s battery energy storage in Lincoln, for example, helped establish the largest long-duration energy storage project in the world. On April 9, four of her Republican colleagues in the Senate wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phaseouts, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. This bill is essentially a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Maine families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Collins has an opportunity to inject some common sense into this bill and protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Now that the bill has passed the House, it will move to the Senate next. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers. I urge Collins to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/climate-change-ski-mountain-snow-maine-bennett-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:14.702211

Gavin Newsom.

Newsom recently announced the launch of CalHeatScore, a cutting-edge tool to forecast and rank heat severity risks and connect Californians with available resources to stay safe during extreme heat events. With CalHeatScore, California becomes the first state in the nation — and one of the only jurisdictions in the world — to launch a heat-ranking system. Newsom’s office says this announcement comes as the Trump administration makes life-threatening cuts to the federal government’s weather monitoring apparatus.

CalHeatScore, developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, brings together ZIP code level data to provide locally tailored guidance. The tool identifies groups most susceptible to extreme heat — such as older adults and children — and provides tips for staying safe, such as how to recognize signs of heat illness. The tool additionally integrates other important data sets, like locations for the nearest cooling centers.

Newsom additionally announced $32.4 million to support 47 California communities in lifesaving extreme heat mitigation efforts. The Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program aims to support local, tribal and regional efforts to combat dangerous heat exposure by building long-lasting infrastructure solutions and strengthening community resilience needed to withstand extreme heat events.

“Extreme heat kills — and with the federal government cutting the very programs that help forecast it, California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Newsom. “With the first major heat of the summer expected this weekend, we’re connecting more Californians — particularly those that are most vulnerable to dangerous heat — to life-saving information, resources and programs across the state.”

In a hotter, drier world, connecting Californians with extreme weather information and resources has never been more important — especially as the federal government cuts critical programs providing pertinent information on weather, added Newsom’s office.

First-in-the-nation heat-ranking tool

The new CalHeatScore tool will be leveraged across state government, providing early warning that allows resources to be mobilized with greater speed and precision to communities that need it, promise staffers. To ensure the new tool works for Californians, the state will continue gathering input from the public, which will be used to shape future updates.

“Every single preventable death is one too many,” said Yana Garcia, California’s secretary for environmental protection. “This groundbreaking tool will help Californians plan and respond so they can stay safe when a heat wave is about to strike. And it will shore up the state’s all-in fight against the very real dangers that climate change keeps bringing to our doorstep.”

In 2021, the California Department of Insurance’s Climate Insurance Workgroup recommended California build a system to rank heat waves to better communicate the deadly risks to Californians and help communities prepare, similar to how tropical storms and hurricanes are described by category level.

As part of a broader climate package in 2022, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 2238 by Assemblymember Luz Rivas to codify CDI’s recommendation by requiring the state to develop a statewide extreme heat ranking system.

“CalHeatScore is an important tool to prepare Californians for extreme heat,” said Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “It helps increase our readiness for heat events and protect those at greatest risk.”

Building on investments to protect Californians

The funding recently announced builds on the governor’s extreme heat action plan, which guides the state’s response to extreme heat events. Developed in partnership with more than 20 state agencies and informed by more than 1,000 individuals through listening sessions and public engagement, these grants respond directly to community needs and build on existing state programs.

Extreme heat solutions announced recently combine physical infrastructure with nature-based solutions and in-home technology to create more resilient communities. In Northern California, for example, North Coast Opportunities and the Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California will partner to provide solar-powered air conditioning in the homes of vulnerable community members.

“California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Samuel Assefa, director of Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation, the agency overseeing the funding. “With lives on the line each summer, the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program will provide critical infrastructure investments in heat vulnerable communities.”

Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the state, claiming more lives annually than any other climate threat, including fires and floods. Last year, California communities experienced the hottest summer on record in 130 years. According to a report from the Department of Insurance, from 2013 to 2022, seven extreme heat events resulted in nearly 460 deaths, over 5,000 hospitalizations and about 344 adverse birth outcomes.

State research shows a correlation between heat and a range of negative health effects including death, lower birth weight and increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations for conditions ranging from heart conditions to poor mental health. Extreme heat also takes an economic toll on the state, with an estimated $7.7 billion of lost wages, agricultural disruptions and power outages.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution.
Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them.","Much has been in local news about electric power generation and distribution centering around solar power, as well as the “Grain Belt Express” power distribution plans that affect Pike County in Illinois and Ralls County in Missouri.

Going back in history, Thomas Edison was a pioneer in technology development and one of the first to develop the new technology of electrification. However, he was human, and his quest to provide the distribution of electrical power was flawed in the fact that what he proposed as Direct Current (DC) power could not be up- or down-converted in voltage. So, the size of the wire to transmit electric power would have been massive like the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge.

A guy by the name of George Westinghouse, however, had the idea of using Alternating Current (AC) on what would become the preferred form to transmit electric energy over long distances and be used by all consumers. The use of electrical transformers could up-convert and down-convert the electrical energy from more than 100kV down to 120V in those early days, as it still does today.

Fast forward nearly 130 years later and the development of high-power regulators to convert AC power to DC and inverters to convert DC power to AC, along with storage batteries such as lithium iron phosphate, has been developed.

It is good to look at new developments that now allow more efficient long-distance transmission of electrical energy by DC current, replacing a four-wire WYE configuration AC lines with only a two-wire DC current run. This is what is planned with “The Grain Belt Express” plan that has strong opposition from people like Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.

His concern about the issue of eminent domain is valid, but his assumption that the project is of a “radical ‘green agenda” is not. As an attorney, it would be good if he stuck to using his skills to mitigate property conflicts in adapting such new technologies, while realizing he may not be an expert on such technologies himself.

This project will allow four separate electric grid systems in North America to be connected efficiently to better distribute and manage the load requirements of wind turbines and solar, as well as other energy sources of the United States and Canada. Situations such as the power grid failure in Texas in February 2021, an isolated grid from the rest of the U.S. that saw the system drop to as low as 59.4 AC cycles per second and colipase, need to be avoided in the future with sound engineering and energy development programs like the HVDC power Grain Belt Express.

Newly developed technology with wind turbines now allows the replacement of mechanical gear drive mechanisms in their hubs that were needed to reach 60-cycle AC to be replaced with AC-to-DC solid state regulators and inverters, either in the hubs or at the location, to allow an entire wind turbine farm to be more efficient. They are similar in manner but in reverse to your outside central air conditioner, which takes 60-cycle AC power and converts it in a regulator to DC, then through an inverter to run back to an AC motor — not at 60 cycles but as low as 20 cycles to run as energy efficient while meeting the heat dissipation requirements and as quiet as possible.

Latest technologies have developed to provide effective high-speed circuit breaker disconnects of the high-voltage DC lines. Unlike AC power, which goes to 0 volts 60 times per second, the DC current level is constant. To the nearest thousand miles, electricity travels at 186,000 miles per second. If you see wind turbines not rotating at a given location, you can pretty much assume the wind is blowing through others in other locations most times in our country.

Yes, solar panels only convert energy during the day, and we need sources like natural gas-driven turbine power plants to generate electricity in the years to come. However, taking action like making our long line power grid transmit DC power can mitigate the interoperability problems of 60-cycle AC power grids with wind turbines and solar sources we face today.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution. Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them. We need to make sure we are good stewards of the land and nature.

What we can’t allow to happen is what occurred on the 120-acre farm that once was my grandfather’s. White silica sand was mined out of the ground and transported by truck to feed the fracking process being done in places like Pennsylvania to mine natural gas. The red arrow shows the area of my family farm in Illinois that was now mined-out farmland. The green area was saved only due to the fact of a 19th-century family cemetery being present.

Replay the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to hear Trump state how wrong Harris was initially on the environmental effects of fracking, only to change her mind to be in favor. He even mentions it in his closing remarks. She did change her mind, but it must be noted that the technology also changed in about 2018 to allow brown sand, like you find in west Texas, to be used in place of the round ball barring type white silica sand in applications less than 800 feet deep. So much for the old Carpenter family farm mined out before August 2019 before mining in LaSalle County (Ill.) farmland essentially stopped.

Not much is being said about the new energy generation facility on Koch’s Lane just west of Ambiance. It looks like all the solar panels are in, as well as other equipment (maybe inverters). The lithium iron phosphate batteries likely need to come from China, so it will be interesting when the facility can take delivery. China is fourth in countries with the most lithium reserves behind Chile, Australia and Argentina.

We should be mindful of how Lithium is mined in places like China. This solar farm will be different in terms of most other solar farms, as it stores much of its energy in very large banks of these batteries and goes online only when high power usage requires help to reduce “brownouts” or voltage reduction, which causes more inefficient energy consumption.

I hope you find some of what I have written to be helpful. Try to balance your judgments to include considerations of making the best use of new technologies being developed by some of the smartest people in this world.

I think I understand what new electrical generation hardware placed in given areas means to people. A while back, I was not in favor of an ethanol plant being across the road from my front yard but may have considered at the time being bought out at 50% above market value of my home and the homes of my neighbors so people working at the plant could live in that housing close to work.

Now comes new efforts to build many new nuclear power plants in the U.S. They take great amounts of water to cool them, so planting them next to the Mississippi River and our community could very well happen.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

A team of scientists just solved a fusion energy problem that's held researchers back for nearly 70 years — and the fix could fast-track cheaper, cleaner electricity.

Fusion works by fusing atoms together to produce heat, just like the sun does. That heat can be used to make electricity without burning gas or coal and without creating long-lived nuclear waste. It's clean, safe, and virtually limitless.

But fusion depends on super-hot plasma trapped inside magnetic fields. And for decades, one problem has stayed unsolved: high-energy particles kept slipping through gaps in those magnetic fields, draining energy and killing the reaction.

Now, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and Type One Energy say they've cracked it. Their new method pinpoints and fixes those ""holes"" using a faster and more accurate approach, reducing design time for fusion reactors by up to 90%.

""What's most exciting is that we're solving something that's been an open problem for almost 70 years,"" said lead researcher Josh Burby. ""It's a paradigm shift in how we design these reactors.""

This discovery could jumpstart the development of stellarators — a fusion reactor design known for reliability and safety. Until now, they've been slow to build because of their complex magnetic systems. This fix removes that roadblock.

It could also improve tokamak designs, which face different risks. In tokamaks, poorly contained particles can damage the reactor walls. The new method helps engineers map and avoid those failure points before they become dangerous.

""There is currently no practical way to find a theoretical answer to the alpha-particle confinement question without our results,"" Burby said. ""Direct application of Newton's laws is too expensive. Perturbation methods commit gross errors. Ours is the first theory that circumvents these pitfalls.""

Faster, safer design could lead to working reactors sooner than expected — a win for cities, power companies, and families stuck with rising energy costs. Fusion doesn't rely on mining or drilling, and once it's running, it's far cheaper to maintain than dirty fuels.

Fewer dirty power plants mean less heat-trapping pollution and cleaner air, especially for neighborhoods near industrial sites. That also means fewer asthma attacks, fewer ER visits, and healthier communities.

Until fusion reaches your block, the easiest way to save money and support clean energy is at home. Installing solar panels can bring your energy costs close to $0. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000.

Type One Energy is already building next-generation reactors using this new approach. Other companies, like TAE Technologies and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, are racing toward similar goals.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fusion-energyimage-recUC0zlgLPj0TxU3.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 16:07:20.294055

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.","Dig down about a mile or two in parts of the United States and you’ll start to see the remains of an ancient ocean. The shells of long dead sea creatures are compressed into white limestone, surrounding brine aquifers with a higher salt content than the Atlantic Ocean.

Last summer, Exxon Mobil sponsored week-long camps to teach grade school students from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi about the virtues of these aquifers, specifically their ability to serve as carbon capture and sequestration wells, where oil, gas, and heavy industry can bury harmful emissions deep underground. In one exercise, students were given 20 minutes to build a model reservoir out of vegetable oil, Play-Doh, pasta, and uncooked beans. Whoever could keep the most vegetable oil (meant to represent liquified carbon dioxide) in their aquifer, won.

This kind of down-home carbon capture boosterism is a relatively new development for the oil and gas giant. Over recent years, Exxon Mobil and other fossil fuel companies have spent millions lobbying for government support of what they see as industry-friendly green technology, most prominently carbon capture and storage, which many scientists and environmental activists have argued is ineffective and distracts from eliminating fossil fuel operations in the first place. According to Exxon’s website, it’s evidence that they are leading “the biggest energy transition in history.”

Now that Congress has turned its attention to rolling back government spending on renewable energy, it appears that most of the climate “solutions” being left off the chopping block are the ones favored by carbon-intensive companies like Exxon. Corporate tax breaks for carbon capture and storage, for instance, were one of the few things left untouched when House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. What remained of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits were incentives for nuclear, so-called clean fuels like ethanol, and carbon capture. When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture.

“Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are subsidizing a private sewer system for oil and gas,” said Sandra Steingraber, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Science and Environmental Health Network.

The tax credits for nuclear power plants, which produce energy without emitting greenhouse gases, are meant to spur what President Donald Trump hopes will be an “energy renaissance,” bolstered by a flurry of pro-nuclear executive orders he issued a day after the budget bill cleared the House. Projects will be able to use the tax credits if they begin construction by 2031; wind and solar companies, however, will lose access to tax credits unless they begin construction within 60 days of Trump signing the bill, and are fully up and running by 2028.

That the carbon capture tax credit was never in danger of being revoked is a testament to its importance to the oil and gas industry, said Jim Walsh, the policy director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “The major beneficiaries of these tax credits are oil and gas companies and big agricultural interests.”

The carbon capture tax credit was first established in 2008, but the subsidies were more than doubled when it was tacked on to the IRA in order to get former senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s vote. Companies now receive $60 for every ton of CO2 captured and used to drive oil out of the ground (a process known as “enhanced oil recovery”) and up to $85 for a ton of CO2 that is permanently stored. As roughly 60 percent of captured C02 in the United States is used for enhanced oil recovery, detractors see the tax credit as something of a devil’s bargain, a provision that props up an industry at taxpayer expense.

How much carbon is actually captured by these projects is also a matter of debate. The tax credit requires companies that claim it to self-report how much CO2 they inject to the Internal Revenue Service. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is in charge of tracking leaks. There are tax penalties if captured carbon ends up leaking, but those penalties only apply if the leaks occur in the first three years after injection. Holding companies accountable is made more complicated by the fact that tax returns are confidential, and Walsh cautions that there is very little communication between the EPA and the IRS. Oversight is “very, very minimal,” added Anika Juhn, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.

“You can keep some really played out oil fields going for a long time, and you can get the public to pay for it,” said Carolyn Raffensberger, the executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, explaining the potential impact of the budget bill. “So the argument is, ‘This is a win for the climate, it’s a win for energy dominance.’ [But] it’s really a budget buster with no guardrails at all.”

Existing carbon-capture facilities have been plagued by technical and financial issues. The country’s first commercial carbon capture plant in Decatur, Illinois, sprung two leaks last year directly under Lake Decatur, which is the town’s main source of drinking water. When concentrated CO2 hits water it turns into carbonic acid, which then leaches heavy metals from rocks within the aquifer and poisons the water. Although a certain level of public health concerns come with many emerging technologies, critics point out that all of this risk is being taken for a technology that has not been proven to work at scale, and may actually increase emissions by incentivizing more oil and gas production. It could also strain the existing electrical grid — outfitting a natural gas or coal plant with carbon capture equipment can suck up about 15 to 25 percent of the plant’s power.

The tax credits exist “to pollute and confuse people,” said Mark Jacobsen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who has argued that there is essentially no reasonable use for carbon capture. They “increase people’s [energy] costs and do nothing for the climate.”

But the technology does have its defenders among scientists. The 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called an increase in carbon capture technology “unavoidable” if countries want to reach net-zero emissions. Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an umbrella organization of fossil fuel companies, unions, and environmental groups, contends that arguments like Jacobsen’s unnecessarily set the technology against renewables. “We need all the solutions in the toolkit,” she said. “We’re not saying don’t deploy these other technologies. We see this very much as a complementary and supportive piece in the broader decarbonization toolkit.”

Stolark said that carbon capture didn’t make it out of the budget process entirely unscathed, as the bill specified that companies could no longer sell carbon capture tax credits. So-called “transferability” — the ability to sell these tax credits on the open market — has been invaluable to small energy startups that have struggled to secure financing in their early stages, according to Stolark. The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.

Still, the kinds of companies likely to claim carbon capture tax credits — often major players in oil and gas, ammonia, steel, and other heavy industries — are less likely to rely on transferability than more modest companies (often providers of renewable energy), whose smaller tax bills makes it harder for them to realize the value of their respective tax credits.

“A lot of the factories, the power plants, the industrial facilities deploying within the next ten years or so, are expected to be these really big [facilities] with the big tax burdens,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovations, a clean energy think tank based in San Francisco. “They’re not the type of smaller producers — like small solar companies — that are reliant on transferability in order to monetize the tax credit.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CCS-Well.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-31 15:06:25.482925

PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center and Evergreen Action have released a new interactive map that highlights federal clean energy investments in Pennsylvania.

The map tracks renewable energy projects across the state that utilize federal funds from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), allowing users to see the businesses, houses of worship, and public buildings pursuing projects ranging from installing solar panels and increasing energy efficiency to monitoring air quality and planting trees.

“Federal investments are fueling growth in local industries, creating new jobs, and laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity,” said Julia Kortrey, Deputy State Policy Director of Evergreen Action. “Pennsylvanians deserve an affordable, clean energy future, and these funds are making that future a reality.”

The release also provides Pennsylvanians interested in switching to clean energy alternatives with a “clean energy home toolkit,” a resource guide on how to use rebates and tax incentives from the IRA. In the first year after the IRA’s implementation of tax credits for individuals, businesses, and nonprofits, 160,000 Pennsylvanians saved more than $260 million.

“With these tax credits and incentives there’s never been a better time to go solar or get a heat pump or [electric vehicle],” said Ellie Kearns, PennEnvironment’s Climate and Clean Energy Advocate. Although up-front costs can be high, the incentives and credits available in the clean energy home toolkit can greatly reduce the costs of switching to renewable energy. At the same time, energy efficient upgrades will “pay for themselves” in the long run, “especially as utility bills continue to rise,” added Kearns.

The tools provided by PennEnvironment and Evergreen indicate reasons for optimism regarding the future of clean energy in Pennsylvania. According to PennEnvironment Deputy Director Flora Cardoni, “Pennsylvania has an immense, largely untapped opportunity when it comes to clean energy. And we have the technology to build a clean energy future today.” Cardoni pointed to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showing that, if Pennsylvania continues to pursue clean energy projects, the state has the technical potential to generate five times its electricity demand in 2020 from the sun and 15% of its annual electricity demand from the wind.

Currently, however, Pennsylvania lags behind other states in growing renewable energy generation. For example, while Pennsylvania increased clean energy production by 57 percent between 2015 and 2024, it ranked 49th out of the 50 states by percent increase in total solar, wind and geothermal generation during that period. By contrast, neighboring states including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio greatly outperformed the Commonwealth in increasing their generation of solar power.

There is, however, a plan in the pipeline which would help bring Pennsylvania back on par with its neighbors. In April, Governor Shapiro unveiled his Lightning Plan, a six-part legislative package which would “put the Keystone State on the path towards a new, cleaner energy future.” The various pieces of legislation contained in this plan would require utility companies supplying electricity in Pennsylvania to get 35 percent of their power from renewable energy sources by 2035, streamline the process to approve new clean energy projects, create programs to help Pennsylvanians switch to solar power and lower pollution, and create more tax breaks and incentives for switching to renewable energy.

READ: Pennsylvanians Won Important Victories for Clean Energy and the Environment in 2024

Polling shows that there is widespread bipartisan support in Pennsylvania for increasing renewable energy production. According to a poll conducted by Global Strategy Group in 2024, 93 percent of Democrats, 84 percent of independents, and 59 percent of Republicans support increasing the use of wind and solar energy.

The use of federal tax credits and incentives to promote a transition to clean energy, including those deployed under the IRA, enjoys even broader support. Another 2024 poll showed that “87 percent of Americans support federal incentives to deploy solar and energy storage, including 78 percent of 2020 Trump voters.”

Despite this bipartisan support, federal tax credits and incentives are on the chopping block during the ongoing congressional budget negotiations. “If the tax credits are repealed,” said Kearns, “we expect that many individuals, businesses, and non-profits will slow or even stop their efforts to install solar, buy EVs, [or] switch to heat pumps because the price becomes out of reach for at least the near future.”

In addition, the Trump administration is attempting to claw back congressionally approved grants distributed under the IRA to state and local governments, businesses, and farmers. If these efforts are successful, many of the projects illuminated in this new interactive map will likely be cancelled.

“There is some grant money that has already been dispersed and even used already, but there are also grants that have been paused or even attempted to be rolled back,” said Kearns. “The Shapiro administration has been suing so that Pennsylvania gets the money that it was allocated, but the fate of a lot of this funding is still murky and unknown.”

Red states and congressional districts have benefitted the most from the IRA since its passage: More than 110 major clean energy and clean vehicle factories and other projects are in development or have already broken ground in the southeastern states. Twenty-one house Republicans, including Reps. Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan from Pennsylvania, have signed onto a letter asking congressional leaders not to repeal tax credits, but the future of these clean energy incentives remains uncertain.

PennEnvironment advocates have urged a call to action for Pennsylvanians who want to protect clean energy investments. “Pennsylvanians … should call their Congressmember and Senators and ask them to maintain all clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits, rebates, and incentives so those who want to can choose clean energy,” said Kearns.

Cardoni added that residents should also urger theur state lawmakers to pass Gov. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan and “prioritize other policies that would increase the amount of clean, renewable energy like wind and solar in the state and that would improve energy efficiency and conservation.”",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Clean-energy_Pennsylvania.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 11:03:25.440552

From a purely business perspective, the elimination of Energy Star isn’t merely about labels on appliances; it directly impacts operational costs, performance consistency and market competitiveness.

The Energy Star program stands as a remarkably successful example of a public-private partnership that delivers substantial, measurable benefits to American consumers and businesses and the environment.

Energy Star has long provided clear and reliable standards that have enabled small businesses to make informed investments in energy-efficient products. This clarity translates into direct financial savings, reducing energy expenses by up to 30 percent according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s own data.

Especially for small businesses operating on tight margins, these savings aren’t trivial — they represent critical capital that can be reinvested into core business activities such as product development, hiring additional employees or expanding market reach.

Beyond immediate cost reductions, Energy Star has established an essential standardization in measuring and reporting appliance and equipment performance. Small business owners have relied on these standards to make purchases confidently, knowing they are investing in products that perform efficiently and reliably over their lifespan.

Without the program, businesses face increased uncertainty, leading to potentially costly investments in substandard products that fail to deliver the promised efficiency and reliability.

Consumer trust, a crucial component of market competitiveness for all businesses, is also at risk. The label is widely recognized and trusted by a majority of American households, signaling verified quality and efficiency.

Its absence would likely result in an influx of misleading performance claims and unverified efficiency assertions, damaging consumer confidence and creating a competitive environment where cutting corners becomes commonplace. This race to the bottom ultimately harms businesses committed to genuine quality and performance standards.

Moreover, from an economic standpoint, the return on investment provided by the program speaks for itself — every federal dollar spent on the program results in approximately $350 in cost savings for businesses and consumers alike. Small businesses particularly benefit from these savings, which enhance profitability, improve cash flow and bolster overall economic resilience.

The decision to defund Energy Star appears driven less by fiscal prudence and more by an ideological stance against terms like “climate change” and “sustainability.” However, dismissing these concepts as mere political rhetoric overlooks the substantial and proven economic benefits they offer businesses and consumers.

Efficiency and sustainability are practical, financially responsible strategies that reduce operational costs, strengthen consumer confidence and enhance long-term business viability.

Ultimately, maintaining funding for Energy Star isn’t about ideological debates, it’s a smart business decision that helps American businesses and consumers. Preserving a program that has demonstrably reduced costs, standardized performance and protected consumer trust should be a straightforward choice for any administration committed to the economic health and competitiveness of American small businesses.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/energy-star_05072025_AP_AP25127640518935.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-31 14:06:23.101246

Activity in state legislatures — and competition for data centers — has been brisk in recent months, amid an intensifying buildout of the energy-hungry data centers and a search for new sites that was ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Many states are offering financial incentives worth tens of millions of dollars. In some cases, those incentives are winning approval, but only after a fight or efforts to require data centers to pay for their own electricity or meet energy efficiency standards.

Some state lawmakers have contested the incentives in places where a heavy influx of massive data centers has caused friction with neighboring communities. In large part, the fights revolve around the things that tech companies and data center developers seem to most want: large tracts of land, tax breaks and huge volumes of electricity and water.

And their needs are exploding in size: from dozens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts and from dozens of acres up to hundreds of acres for large-scale data centers sometimes called a hyperscaler.

While critics say data centers employ relatively few people and pack little long-term job-creation punch, their advocates say they require a huge number of construction jobs to build, spend enormous sums on goods and local vendors and generate strong tax revenues for local governments.

In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are writing legislation to fast-track permitting for data centers. The state is viewed as an up-and-coming data center destination, but there is also a sense that Pennsylvania is missing out on billions of dollars in investment that's landing in other states.

“Pennsylvania has companies that are interested, we have a labor force that is capable and we have a lot of water and natural gas,” said state Rep. Eric Nelson. ""That’s the winning combination. We just have a bureaucratic process that won’t open its doors.”

It's been a big year for data centers

Kansas approved a new sales tax exemption on goods to build and equip data centers, while Kentucky and Arkansas expanded pre-existing exemptions so that more projects will qualify.

Michigan approved one that carries some protections, including requirements to use municipal utility water and clean energy, meet energy-efficiency measures and ensure that it pays for its own electricity.

Such tax exemptions are now so widespread — about three dozen states have some version of it — that it is viewed as a must-have for a state to compete.

“It’s often a nonstarter if you don’t have them, for at least the hyperscalers,” said Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL. “It’s just such a massive impact on the overall spend of the data center.”

Zoning, energy fights often frustrate developers

In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to create “microgrid” districts free from local zoning and electric rate regulations where data centers can procure power from standalone power plants.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called the bill his “landmark policy proposal” for 2025 to put West Virginia “in a class of its own to attract new data centers and information technology companies.”

Utah and Oklahoma passed laws to make it easier for data center developers to procure their own power supply without going through the grid while Mississippi rolled out tens of millions of dollars in incentives last year to land a pair of Amazon data centers.

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed legislation earlier this month that eased regulations to speed up power plant construction to meet demand from data centers, including a massive Facebook facility.

The final bill was fought by some lawmakers who say they worried about data centers using disproportionate amounts of water, taking up large tracts of land and forcing regular ratepayers to finance the cost of new power plants.

“I do not like that we’re making customers pay for two power plants when they only need one,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told colleagues during floor debate.

Still, state Sen. Russell Ott suggested that data centers should be viewed like any other electricity customer because they reflect a society that is “addicted” to electricity and are “filling that need and that desire of what we all want. And we're all guilty of it. We’re all responsible for it.”

Some lawmakers are hesitant

In data center hotspots, some lawmakers are pushing back.

Lawmakers in Oregon are advancing legislation to order utility regulators to ensure data centers pay the cost of power plants and power lines necessary to serve them.

Georgia lawmakers are debating a similar bill.

In Virginia, the most heavily developed data center zone in the U.S., Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have forced more disclosures from data center developers about their site's noise pollution and water use.

In Texas, which endured a deadly winter blackout in 2021, lawmakers are wrestling with how to protect the state's electric grid from fast-growing data center demand.

Lawmakers still want to attract data centers, but a bill that would speed up direct hookups between data centers and power plants has provisions that are drawing protests from business groups.

Those provisions would give utility regulators new authority to approve those agreements and order big electric users such as data centers to switch to backup generators in a power emergency.

Walt Baum, the CEO of Powering Texans, which represents competitive power plant owners, warned lawmakers that those provisions might be making data center developers hesitant to do business in Texas.

“You’ve seen a lot of new announcements in other states and over the last several months and not as much here in Texas,"" Baum told House members during a May 7 committee hearing. ""I think everybody right now is in a waiting pattern and I worry that we could be losing to other states while that waiting pattern is happening.”

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote.
The unplanned outages that MISO described shed more light on why residents faced forced blackouts.
Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning.
Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.","Louisiana’s electric grid was missing a huge amount of power last weekend because of unplanned outages at power plants, contributing to the grid operator’s decision to order forced blackouts to avoid a “catastrophic” blackout similar to a recent crisis in Spain and Portugal, according to an internal memo.

The Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, which operates the electric grid in a large swath of middle America, abruptly ordered Entergy and Cleco to “shed load” last Sunday or initiate forced blackouts for about 100,000 in the New Orleans region. The event has raised concerns from regulators and elected officials, who have scheduled multiple upcoming hearings about why the public wasn’t notified sooner and how the customers who had the lights turned off were chosen.

The operator, known as MISO, wrote in a memo shared with some government officials Friday that it was aware of power plants that were down for routine maintenance, which it said is normal in the spring. The Times-Picayune obtained a copy of the memo.

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote. That’s enough electricity to theoretically power several million homes.

It says a “major transmission line” was also out of service because of tornadoes in March. And temperatures were higher than normal over the weekend.

Asked about the memo on Friday, MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said there were seven total unplanned outages leading up to the blackout, including a large power station that went offline last Wednesday, presumably the River Bend nuclear plant. MISO doesn’t share unit-specific information, but Entergy’s River Bend was shut down on that date because of a leak and didn’t come back on for five days. It’s not clear which other power plants were out, but Louisiana’s utilities rely heavily on natural gas to generate electricity.

The unplanned outages that MISO described shed more light on why residents faced forced blackouts. But they also raise more questions about who owns the generators that went down and why they were offline.

Entergy New Orleans spokesperson Beau Tidwell said in an email Friday that Entergy had three units on planned maintenance outages before the River Bend unit went down, and that those were accounted for by MISO.

He said ""other non-Entergy owned units were also experiencing outages during the event.""

""As we have noted, Entergy's models did not show the need for load shed, but we recognize that MISO's models have a broader view of the grid due to its status as the regional transmission operator,"" Tidwell said.

The transmission line that was out was an Entergy line that was destroyed by tornadoes in March and was still being rebuilt. Tidwell said Entergy had developed a ""reconfiguration protocol"" while the line was down.

Some officials have criticized MISO’s lack of advance notice, which could have allowed Entergy or regulators to curtail power usage before requiring blackouts. Instead, city council members said Entergy only received a three-minute warning before having to cut power.

Logan Burke, head of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said Friday that the huge amount of power being offline helps explain the load shed.

“The next question is, who owns that generation?” Burke said in an email. “Investigations are needed to identify why that much power dropped offline unexpectedly.”

MISO was managing the problems until Sunday, when transmission lines became overloaded, risking “cascading outages,” according to the memo.

“Absent shedding load, a catastrophic blackout (as Spain and Portugal recently experienced) could have occurred, causing significant damage to the transmission system in Southern Louisiana,” the memo said.

Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning. In an email to customers Thursday, Entergy said it “regrets that Entergy was not provided with enough prior notice of the outage to prepare our customers for the potential loss of power.”

Entergy has long faced accusations that it does not have adequate transmission lines — which carry bulk power long distances — in its service territory. Amid scrutiny from the Department of Justice for allegedly wielding its monopoly to crowd out competitors, Entergy joined MISO in 2013. MISO directs where power flows and operates a wholesale market for the sale of bulk power.

Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.

When the grid loses large amounts of power, it can create instability on transmission lines, which get overheated if there’s too much demand and not enough power, he said. If Entergy had more transmission capacity in the region, Kowalczyk said power may have been able to more easily flow, stabilizing the grid.

“We had power locked up in Mississippi. We had power locked up north of Louisiana. It had no way to get where it needed to go,” he said. “Events like this are a reminder of how far behind MISO South is on planning. They’re about 10 years late.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/08016498-37e6-11ee-a8fa-17264d73953b/64d58e69c6d05.image.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-31 13:09:51.185799

Thus, it makes economic sense to continue incentivizing clean energy projects.","Clean energy investments in the U.S. have amounted to $1 trillion over the past six years, resulting in boosts for the environment and for investors.

This ""trillion-dollar win,"" as energy research nonprofit RMI called it, created over 300,000 new jobs between 2018 and 2024, spanning both the first Trump administration and the following Biden administration.

Both consumers and companies have increasingly invested in eco-friendly initiatives, demonstrating how going green is good for business. Federal and state governments have encouraged this by creating incentives for clean energy projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed in 2022, included Congress's largest investment in climate action. RMI reported that the IRA led to a tripling in quarterly clean energy technology investments over the past few years.

High-profile energy projects have cropped up in various states since the IRA's passage. For example, the Qcells solar panel factory in Dalton, Georgia, created 2,500 new jobs, with another 4,000 pending. Another solar manufacturing facility, First Solar, opened in Trinity, Alabama, last September and is expected to add 800 employees.

However, the future of these projects is uncertain because the Trump administration has announced intentions to roll back policies supporting them. This has caused some companies to suspend or slow down their investments.

Investment in clean energy helps protect the planet while creating new jobs for American workers. These projects have benefited red and blue states alike, with Republican voting states receiving slightly more, with 64% of new investments, according to RMI. Thus, it makes economic sense to continue incentivizing clean energy projects.

It can be difficult to find the right businesses to invest in, especially if you want your financial decisions to align with your values.

Avoiding greenwashing is another challenge in harnessing your money for good. But with a little research on investing in clean economy stocks or upgrading your 401(k), you can make your money speak for you.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trillion-dollar-winimage-recLmcoN5jsFE0Ua4.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:09:08.657613

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

As per the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, a proposed railroad project would run nearly 90 miles through the state Utah, connecting a remote region rich in oil to a more central rail network to simplify the transport of crude oil.

The Supreme Court held that the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was not required to consider certain environmental effects of the operation and construction of a proposed railway route. The Supreme Court determined the D.C. Circuit failed to provide appropriate deference to the STB under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and had “incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the STB to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place” (specifically oil drilling in Utah and oil production in the Gulf region) that might result from construction of the railway. NEPA is an environmental law designed to promote the enhancement of the environment, signed by President Richard Nixon, and considered one of the foundational environmental laws formed at the beginning of the modern environmental movement.

The Supreme Court’s decision is a setback for environmentalists, and President Donald Trump has criticized the government’s environmental review process as too cumbersome.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained in the Court’s opinion, “NEPA imposes no substantive environmental obligations or restrictions” on the board or on any other federal agency.

NEPA often hinders land development, as environmental groups or citizens opposing projects have the ability to sue, claiming that the STB that must approve the project did not prepare an adequate environmental impact statement.

“Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible,” wrote Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Court’s opinion. “Here, the board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process.”

In terms of future rural land development, the decision handed down in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado could impact the future of the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) and U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing. The Joint Task Force is an initiative that identifies underutilized federal lands for residential development, streamlines land transfer processes, and promotes policies that increase the availability of affordable housing.

“This partnership will identify underutilized federal land suitable for residential development and streamline the land transfer process,” explained DOI Secretary Doug Burgum in a March announcement. “It will also promote policies to increase the availability of affordable housing, while balancing important environmental and land use considerations.”

The Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing will streamline regulatory processes so building on federal lands is not held up by environmental reviews, transfer protocols and other priorities.

“This is about more than building houses,” wrote the Secretaries in the Wall Street Journal. “We want to build hope. Overlooked rural and tribal communities will be a focus of this joint agreement. We are going to invest in America’s many forgotten communities. As we enter the Golden Age promised by President Trump, this partnership will change how we use public resources.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said his department decided to cancel 24 grants issued by the Biden administration because those projects were not economically viable and did not meet the nation's energy needs.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.”

Timothy Winters, president and CEO of Western New York Energy, did not return a request for comment on the Energy Department's move. But Juliette Strasser, communications and policy director for Skyven Technologies, the Texas-based company that partnered with Western New York Energy on the project, said the firm was disappointed to hear of the grant terminations.

""Skyven’s technology is cutting-edge and positions America for global leadership in industrial steam generation,"" she said. ""The Skyven portfolio of projects advance the DOE's and current administration’s goals to unleash American energy dominance, reduce energy costs and improve competitiveness for American manufacturers, support grid reliability, create American jobs and reduce the cost of American household goods.""

Strasser also indicated that the grant termination might not spell the end of the effort in Medina.

""We are reviewing the appeal process and will continue our efforts to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs for American manufacturers,"" she said.

Skyven announced last March that it had won $145 million in federal funding for its industrial decarbonization efforts. And last September, Skyven announced that it will install the largest-ever steam-generating heat pump at Western New York Energy, which produces ethanol and employs about 60 people, according to its website.

The steam pump technology would reduce the carbon dioxide output of the Medina facility by 20,000 metric tons annually, which would be equivalent to removing 4,300 vehicles from the road, Skyven said.

“By integrating Skyven’s cutting-edge Arcturus technology, we are taking significant strides in improving our community’s air quality by reducing our carbon footprint and improving our operational efficiencies,"" Winters said in Skyven's announcement of the program.

Told that the grant had been rescinded, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: ""This over $15 million federal grant for Skyven was promised to the community to help create new good-paying jobs and help reduce energy costs by shifting to steam production to help produce cheaper electricity ... This investment would have reduced the Medina plant’s expensive natural gas costs by up to 20%, all while making the community cleaner by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.""

Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican whose sprawling district includes Medina, did not return a request for comment.

""I hope Congresswoman Tenney will join me in denouncing this harmful cut by the Trump administration that will hurt local jobs and raise energy costs here in Orleans County,"" Schumer said.

In its list of grants that it was rescinding, the Department of Energy did not mention Western New York Energy. But it listed Skyven, the amount of the grant and the fact that it was awarded to a facility in Medina.

In its news release announcing the cancellation of the grants, the Department of Energy said it was primarily targeting carbon capture and sequestration and decarbonization initiatives. Such initiatives are part of the fight against climate change, given that scientists regard carbon dioxide as the main greenhouse gas that's warming the planet.

US FEDERAL AGENCIES TO 'UNLEASH' COAL ENERGY AFTER BIDEN 'STIFLED' IT: 'MINE, BABY, MINE'

The cuts include nearly $332 million pulled from a project at ExxonMobil's Baytown, Texas, refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Carbon capture, often referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a climate change mitigation technology designed to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground.

Climate change activists claim human-produced carbon emissions cause the earth to warm. Trump has long dismissed the theory and has often referred to progressive climate and energy policies as the ""Green New Scam,"" a play on the ""Green New Deal,"" a sweeping climate and economic proposal championed by progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,"" Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the cuts to the projects, meant to be test cases for huge industrial programs, could result in the loss of 25,000 jobs and $4.6 billion in economic output.

The review of the projects came after the Energy Department sought to identify waste, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s goal to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people, the agency said.

These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation. It is anticipated that the project period for both grants will be Oct. 1, 2025, through Sept. 30, 2029, although the entire time frame may not be required for project completion.

Cleanup Grant: Remediation of the Former Knox Laundry Site

The $713,600 Cleanup Grant will support environmental remediation efforts at the former Knox Laundry site, located at the property previously known as 57 N. Kellogg St./332 E. Ferris St. Operated as a retail laundry since 1898 and later expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, the property was vacated and condemned due to its deteriorated condition and ultimately demolished by court order in 2006–2007. Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment, but until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.

The city plans to use grant funds to address remaining contamination, specifically targeting soils impacted above saturation limits. The project will include treatment of affected areas and installation of an engineered barrier, such as pavement, to safely limit potential exposure and prepare the site for future redevelopment.

So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe.
And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar.","This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of US utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize where that stands?

Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that’s going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.

I also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long lives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.

During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.

Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

I don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?

Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

I think that’s the central challenge for the industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.","https://media.wired.com/photos/683994a4f001b3464f287c18/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2197485258.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 10:00:55.137706

Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?","Political bullying is rarely as brutal as it was in Brazil this week when the environment minister Marina Silva was ambushed in a senate meeting. Her thuggish tormentors – all white male politicians on the infrastructure committee – took turns to publicly belittle the 67-year-old black woman, who has done more than anyone to protect the natural wealth of the country – the Amazon rainforest, Pantanal wetlands, Cerrado savannah and other biomes – from rapacious abuse.

One by one, they lined up to attack her for these globally important efforts. Decorum gave way to name-calling and sneering: “Know your place,” roared the committee head, Marcos Rogério, a Bolsonarist who cut Silva’s microphone as she tried to respond. The leader of the centre-rightPSDB, Plínio Valério, told her she did not deserve respect as a minister. The Amazonas senator Omar Aziz – from the Centrão party and a supporter of president Lula – talked over her repeatedly.

Their motives appeared to be partly ideological, partly misogynistic and largely self-interested. All of them were trying to force through economic projects – roads, oilfields, dams or plantations – that are under scrutiny by Silva’s environment ministry. Never mind that this is her job, they seemed to say, how dare she not allow them to have their way?

But she did dare. Despite her frail physique, Silva is a fighter. Born in the Amazon rainforest, she helped to found the Workers’ party alongside Lula during the era of military dictatorship. She campaigned against deforestation alongside Chico Mendes, who was assassinated in 1988. In her first stint as environment minister, between 2003 and 2008, she established a monitoring-and-penalty system that she said reduced forest clearance by 80%. Later, she ran as president for the Green party, securing nearly 20m votes – more than any other Green candidate in world history. Twelve years ago, she founded her own party – the Sustainability Network.

Silva refused to tolerate being abused and silenced, and walked out of the senate meeting. Outside, when she finally had a chance to speak, she turned on her tormentors: “My place is the place to defend democracy, my place is the place to defend the environment, to combat inequality, sustainable development, to protect biodiversity, and infrastructure projects that are necessary for the country,” she said defiantly. “What is unacceptable is for someone to think that because you are a woman, black, and come from a humble background, that you are going to say who I am and still say that I should stay in my place. My place is where all women should be.”

This version of what happened has been reported widely in the Brazilian media, but it tells only part of the story. What is missing – and more important – is why the pack of senators felt Silva was vulnerable. That is because over the previous few days, Lula had taken the side of the oil industry rather than the Amazon rainforest, and then – not by coincidence – the Brazilian environmental movement suffered one of the biggest legislative defeats in its history.

At the centre of everything is a long-running row over oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas. BP and the French oil company Total used to hold most of these rights, but they baulked at the political and environmental challenge of drilling so close to the world’s biggest centre of terrestrial biodiversity. Instead, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, stepped up. For Lula – and the senators in nearby regions – that meant potential votes, jobs and export earnings. The only thing standing in their way was the environment ministry, which has delayed a licence for years due to the risks of a possible spill in such an ecologically sensitive area.

That handbrake was lifted earlier this week, when the head of the environmental regulator, Ibama, ignored the warnings of 29 expert advisers by moving on to the next stage of the approval process for operations in the Foz do Amazonas. This capitulation followed pressure from Congress and the president.

This was followed by the biggest legislative setback for the environment in more than 40 years. To the delight of the mining, construction and farming industries, the senate has passed a long-pending bill that strips a range of environmental licensing powers from Silva’s ministry. This piece of legislation – dubbed the devastation bill by opponents – allows companies to self-license or avoid environmental licensing for road construction, dam-building and other projects. It is a shift of control from the representatives of the people to the executives of big companies.

Lula could yet wield a veto on this bill. But so far the president’s response has been tepid. His party has a weak presence in congress, so he depends on a broad and fractious coalition, many of whose members are enmeshed in agribusiness or mining. Next year’s presidential election seems to be weighing on his mind more than November’s Cop30 climate summit in Belém.

In the wake of the attacks on Silva by the senate infrastructure committee, Lula publicly came to her defence. He said she was right to walk out in the face of so much provocation. But he has not faced up to his responsibility for leaving her exposed. Nor has he faced up to the contradictions of his own promise to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 and his support for evidently incompatible projects, such as oil drilling off the coast of the Amazon, an upgraded BR319 road that would open up the forest between Manaus and Porto Velho to greater clearance activities, and a new grain railway that would increase pressure for more soya bean plantations.

At the Amazon Summit in Belém two years ago, he declined to sign up to Colombian president Gustavo Petro’s calls for a fossil-free rainforest. Soon after, at Cop28 in Dubai, his government shocked many of its supporters by announcing it would join the Opec+ oil cartel. Lula can argue that this is pragmatism as Brazil depends on petroleum sales for a growing share of its GDP. Fossil fuel realpolitik is likely to be evident at a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, where the Brazilian president will rub shoulders with China’s Xi Jinping of China, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders.

Lula has thrown Marina Silva under a cement mixer once before – in 2008, when she was forced to leave his second-term government because too many ministers saw her as a drag on economic development. He may feel reluctant to do so again before Cop30, because he knows she is vital for Brazil’s environmental credibility in the eyes of much of the world, and he does not want his country to return to the pariah status it endured during the Bolsonaro years. But the sands are shifting and Lula seems unsure of his footing.

His base – the working class and poor – are already suffering the brunt of climate impacts. The south of Brazil has been deluged by devastating floods. The northern Amazon has been stricken by record droughts and fires.

Civil society and progressive thinkers – almost all of whom usually support Lula – have been far more active than the president in opposing the devastation bill and defending the environment minister on social media, where many public figures have posted “Marina is not alone” messages of support.

But like many other centre left leaders in the world, Lula is struggling in the age of Trump, of rightwing extremism, of warmongering, of geopolitical realignment and corporate backtracking on the environment. As Silva showed, it takes courage to face those forces. Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e983851f45c534eec8b7c4343b5e312e78f355c/437_0_4372_3498/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db4cfcf71840ae9b27e57993d90cf63f,N,,2025-05-31 10:01:12.075406

He’s hoping to see lawmakers engage in “more thoughtful discussion” on the bill’s clean energy provisions, especially the 60-day construction requirement for commercial solar projects.
One of the best ways to do that is deploying solar [energy].”","As lawmakers in the U.S. Senate face a July 4 deadline to pass a budget reconciliation package narrowly approved by the House of Representatives, renewable energy industry groups and businesses in Central Florida are bracing for painful “disruptions” they say would come from the bill’s proposed repeal of clean energy incentives. Many of those clean energy incentives enacted under the Biden administration funneled jobs and billions of dollars into Republican-controlled states, including Florida.

One provision in the bill’s current language would disqualify projects from using an existing commercial solar energy tax credit, unless project construction begins within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

Such an abrupt shift would breed an unpredictable, “horribly harmful” environment for companies and people working on commercial solar projects, according to Ben Pauluhn, founder and president of Optimus Energy Solutions. The Mount Dora-based company specializes in electric vehicle infrastructure and commercial and residential solar energy projects.

“The employment disruption on that 60-day provision will be massive, and it will not be painless, and it will be nationwide,” Pauluhn said. “It would really put a dampener on a whole lot of momentum that America is currently on with energy independence.”

An earlier version of the bill that would’ve gradually phased out the commercial tax credit over a period of six years made much more financial and logistical sense, Pauluhn said. But as it currently stands, the bill would derail his growing company, throwing it into “survival mode, essentially overnight.”

“Any business can plan for a six-year phase-out,” Pauluhn said. “It's an off-ramp. Agree or disagree with it; from a policy and a business standpoint, one can plan for that.

“If it is halted overnight, the employment disruptions … will be so disruptive that it will cause meaningful pain to people, communities and businesses that is probably not necessary,” Pauluhn said.

In Florida, more than 100,000 jobs are at stake if the proposed repeal of federal tax credits goes through, according to one third-party analysis commissioned by ConservAmerica, a conservative-leaning nonprofit. That report also estimates the average Florida household would pay about $83 more annually for energy costs.

There are more than 52,000 electric vehicles in Orange County alone, many of which were purchased using consumer credits that would be discontinued under the bill, according to Dory Larsen, Senior Electric Transportation Program Manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

“When we look at repealing these programs, it represents broken promises to American consumers,” Larsen said. “And the result would be higher energy costs that we would all be forced to pay.”

Regardless of the barriers, solar energy is here to stay, Pauluhn said — but the question is, at what cost? He’s hoping to see lawmakers engage in “more thoughtful discussion” on the bill’s clean energy provisions, especially the 60-day construction requirement for commercial solar projects.

“Building, maintaining the infrastructure to deliver electricity is going to continue to be more expensive, irrespective of where the electricity comes from,” Pauluhn said. “So we darn well better keep the cost of electricity down. One of the best ways to do that is deploying solar [energy].”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0308e99/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+139/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fb3%2F00ae5ccf4118a69af5211b81a9c7%2Flightbulb-energy-via-pexels-daniel-reche.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:14.301108

In Pennsylvania, residents living in the shadow of U.S. Steel’s plants have contended with air pollution caused by their operations for generations.
The United Steelworkers union endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has long opposed the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon.
“Nippon Steel could bring U.S. Steel workers certainty and hope for the future,” he said.
“If Nippon Steel extends this thinking to U.S. Steel, it could entrench coal for another generation.”","President Donald Trump returned to western Pennsylvania Friday to announce an ending to the months-long saga to decide who would own the Pittsburgh-based steelmaking company U.S. Steel.

But even as the deal moves toward a resolution, questions about what it will mean for public health, local economies and climate change linger. U.S. Steel’s coal-based steelmaking facilities are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania.

Nippon Steel of Japan agreed to buy the iconic American company for $15 billion in 2023. In 2024, the sale was opposed by former President Joe Biden and by Trump. Trump said that he was “totally against” the sale and vowed to “block this deal from happening” as president.

Now, Trump has changed his mind.

Speaking at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Trump said he was there to celebrate a “blockbuster agreement” with Nippon. He added that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25 percent to 50 percent. The increase would “further secure the steel industry in the United States,” he said. “Nobody is going to get around that.”

“We saved the company,” Trump added. His speech was short on details about the structure of the deal or Nippon’s investments in U.S. Steel’s facilities, and much remains unknown.

On May 23, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had approved the sale, calling it a “planned partnership” between U.S. Steel and Nippon that would add “$14 billion to the U.S. economy.” The deal had been held up by a national security review carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.

U.S. Steel praised Trump and said the company will “remain American” and “will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years.”

In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said the U.S. government would have a “golden share” that “will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members” and that $2.4 billion would be invested in the Mon Valley Works, U.S. Steel’s four facilities in western Pennsylvania.

Trump’s reversal comes at the same time that his administration is pushing for more coal power, and after he signed an executive order called “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The Department of Energy recently designated coal used in steelmaking as a “critical material.” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said coal is “a cornerstone of our industrial base” and a “key input for steel production.”

But that’s at odds with the current reality of American steel manufacturing. Less than a third of steel in the U.S. is still made using coal. The majority of American steel is made in electric arc furnaces using recycled scrap steel and natural gas.

On Friday, Trump said U.S. Steel will “maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years.”

“We have that as a commitment,” he said.

Older blast furnaces, like those at the U.S. Steel-owned Edgar Thomson steel mill in western Pennsylvania, are powered by coke, a concentrated and highly polluting form of coal. The Mon Valley Works plants, the oldest of which opened in 1875, include the Clairton Coke Works, which makes coke from coal.

“Most of the new mills, including U.S. Steel’s new mill in Arkansas, they’re not dependent upon coal, and that’s the worldwide trend,” said Matt Mehalik, the executive director at the Pennsylvania-based environmental nonprofit Breathe Project. “So a coal-based manufacturing policy is really a backwards-looking one. It’s sort of like saying, in 1903, ‘Steam engines are important, too. Why would we switch to a gasoline engine?’”

If Nippon spends money to keep U.S. Steel’s aging facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana dependent on coal for another generation, that decision could have long-term negative consequences for workers and residents.

Coal-based steelmaking is linked to serious health problems like cancer for people living nearby. In Pennsylvania, residents living in the shadow of U.S. Steel’s plants have contended with air pollution caused by their operations for generations. The company also has a long history of permit violations and financial penalties. In 2024, U.S. Steel agreed to a $42 million settlement related to faulty pollution control systems at the Clairton Coke Works.

U.S. Steel did not respond to a request for comment for this story but has maintained that it is committed to “safe and environmentally responsible steelmaking.”

The deal also has significant climate implications, said Mike Williams, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on climate policy and labor issues. Steel manufacturing is a substantial contributor to the climate crisis globally. “It’s really, really, really important that we get this right,” he said, of the need to decarbonize the industry.

Neither company has a good track record on climate, he said. And the involvement of the Trump administration in U.S. Steel’s decision-making could “portend very poorly” when it comes to modernizing the American steel industry.

“This administration has such an animus towards anything that fights climate change,” he said. “That’s terrible for the future competitiveness of our industries.”

If Nippon commits to coal, Williams said, it may save some jobs in the short term. But “there’s a strong chance they’re going to be just outstripped in terms of competitiveness” in the global market. Doubling down on coal in steelmaking “doesn’t particularly make sense” economically or environmentally, he said.

A website Nippon created to highlight the benefits of the U.S. Steel deal says the sale will drive the “global steel industry toward carbon neutrality and our shared commitment of decarbonization by 2050.”

The Mon Valley is familiar with promises to invest in its declining steelmaking infrastructure. Those promises have rarely panned out.

“This timeline goes all the way back to the 1970s,” Mehalik said, of a Breathe Project initiative to chronicle each of U.S. Steel’s pledges that failed to materialize. “It’s almost like every five years they promise to do something, and then they don’t.” In 2019, U.S. Steel said it would spend more than $1 billion to upgrade the Mon Valley Works. Two years later, the project was canceled.

U.S. Steel’s workers have similar fears about Nippon’s and the administration’s promises of more investment and jobs. The United Steelworkers union endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has long opposed the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon.

In his speech on Friday, Trump said “there will be no layoffs and no outsourcing” and said workers would each receive a $5,000 bonus. The deal “includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs at all facilities in the United States,” he said.

The union continued to express opposition to the deal this week. “Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs,” said David McCall, the president of USW, in a statement on Tuesday.

U.S. Steel’s workforce has shrunk from hundreds of thousands of workers in its 20th-century heyday to around 22,000 today.

Roger Smith, Asia lead at SteelWatch, a nonprofit focused on the decarbonization of the steel industry, said that Nippon could choose to invest in cutting-edge green steelmaking technology to dramatically lower pollution and cut emissions. “Nippon Steel could bring U.S. Steel workers certainty and hope for the future,” he said.

Smith said the global trend away from coal-based steelmaking will ultimately override the Trump administration’s “protectionist agenda for coal and its anti-renewable energy actions.”

“The question is really not whether the steel industry will decarbonize but how quickly,” he said.

But the Trump administration and Nippon could slow down that transition in the U.S. at a critical time. Nippon “has a paper commitment to achieve net zero emissions, but remains committed to existing coal-based blast furnaces in Japan, building new ones through its joint venture in India and continues to acquire shares in coal mines,” Smith said. “If Nippon Steel extends this thinking to U.S. Steel, it could entrench coal for another generation.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2217152392-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:10:02.974394

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects.
In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.
There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed.
The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.","Wyoming is the second windiest state, after Nebraska. It’s obvious why the wind power industry is investing $10 billion there. And it’s hard to see why any state politician would oppose this. But some have. Wyoming is one of those fossil-fuel producing states in which so-called conservatives feel obligated — or are paid — to stop competition from clean energy. Texas is another.

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects. “It does one thing: puts a moratorium on wind and solar for the next five years,” he said. “It’s a simple little bill.”

A “simple,” five-year plan? How do you say, “Aw, shucks” in Russian?

Hicks swiftly diverted blame to California: “Our friends on the ‘left coast’ with their renewable portfolio demands, eliminating fossil fuels and moving in a direction that’s unsustainable.”

We can’t untie this knot of confused ideology. But let’s point out that renewable energy is the only kind of energy that is, by definition, sustainable. Wyoming may have coal, oil and gas. But it has wind forever.

This hostility toward wind power is even weirder in Texas. Texas harvests more electricity from wind than any other state, or nearly 28% of all wind-generated electricity in the U.S. In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.

The key for these renewables is batteries that can store power when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Texas has been crowned “ground zero” for a U.S. battery boom. Last year it switched on more power stored in batteries than California did.

Texas was expected to double its storage capacity this year — that is, until Donald Trump slapped huge tariffs on China. More than two-thirds of imported batteries come from China.

In March, the Texas Senate passed a mandate that half of all new power capacity come from sources other than battery storage. In other words, at least 50% of all new power plant capacity had to be produced from coal, natural gas and oil. (The natural gas industry needed propping.)

Back in Wyoming, lawmakers wedded to fossil fuels are complaining that large wind and solar projects are fundamentally changing the look of Wyoming’s wide-open spaces. That’s ignoring the aesthetics of Wyoming’s coal pits, wide open craters that stretch for miles.

Wyoming is more than 63 times the size of Rhode Island, with less than half the population of the Ocean State. There are dozens of wind turbines in Rhode Island, onshore and off. More are planned with minimal complaint. Wyoming could easily accommodate new wind projects under its big sky.

There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed. Gov. Mark Gordon tried to bridge the differences by endorsing an “all of the above energy strategy.” He wants to keep Wyoming as “the energy state” but also to address climate change by developing clean renewables.

The far-right Freedom Caucus went after Gordon for acknowledging climate change. It introduced a bill designed to stop the state from pursuing any carbon reduction targets and titled it “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.”

A pragmatic Republican, Gordon called such proposals as “a little bit stupid.”

The bottom line is that Wyoming continues to develop wind energy projects. The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.

Much of what happens from here on in depends on Washington. The recently passed House bill strips away subsidies for renewables. How it fares in the Senate remains to be seen. Suffice it to say, slowing America’s move to cleaner and also cheaper energy is more than a little bit stupid.

Trump-appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts — likely to be officially introduced early next month to then be open for public comment — go against relevant expert scientific advice, public health considerations and basic logic. Nonetheless, they are key components of the Trump Administration’s — and Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 — larger ideologically and profit-driven push to dismantle decades of established U.S. and international science and policy progress to address the harms associated with GHG pollution.

Let’s briefly revisit the clear understanding of the interactions between GHGs, climate change and public health: carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs from fossil fuel-burning power plants drive human-caused climate change and threaten public health. These connections were firmly established through research in the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s that fed into clear statements in United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessments beginning in the 1990s (and every UN IPCC report since then).

Moreover, the power sector is responsible for 25-30% of GHGs in this country, with transportation as the leading source of GHG pollution in the U.S. These facts prompted U.S. policy action beginning over 50 years ago. Most prominent is the 1970 Clean Air Act, which was focused on local and regional air pollution as well as GHG emissions as they relate to environmental harms and public health threats.

About thirty years later — in the face of special interest efforts to not fulfill and to weaken CAA standards — twelve states (not including Colorado), along with several organizations (like the Environmental Defense Fund), petitioned the EPA to regulate GHGs from vehicles (transportation) and stationary sources (power plants). They argued that the EPA had failed to implement the terms and requirements laid out in the CAA. This culminated in a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that the EPA did have authority and responsibility to regulate GHG emissions under the 1970 CAA because GHGs were determined to be air pollutants that endangered public health and welfare.

While the 1970 CAA outlined requirements of the EPA to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution — including GHGs — the EPA under George W. Bush skirted these responsibilities, reasoning that there remained enough uncertainty about linkages between GHG emissions and climate change. This obstinance was formally supported by groups such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Utility Air Regulatory Group, as this would potentially increase their costs of doing business. The 2007 decision was a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court, and notably one of the dissenting justices was Chief Justice John Roberts. Yet, from this ruling, the EPA finalized an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that has set the stage for regulations on coal and gas-fired power plants since then.

Legislative decisions like these have been credited with the avoidance of thousands of premature deaths, lost school and work days annually, as well as declines in respiratory illnesses and other ailments that have saved health care costs and improved human quality of life in the U.S.

In Trump’s first term, he sought various rollbacks and stalled the EPA’s Clean Power Plan from the Obama Administration. But Biden reinstated these rules and further strengthened them through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In Trump’s second term, these EPA moves have come when there are concurrent threats to remove the U.S. from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and to strip California’s authority to set vehicle emissions standards and Electric Vehicle rules. And the Supreme Court of 2025 is more amenable to upholding these actions.

We are also mired in a time of rampant mis- and disinformation problems. The leaked plan argues that fossil fuel burning “does not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” clearly at odds with convergent agreement in relevant expert research communities going back many decades. Nonetheless, in March, Zeldin also laid out EPA and Trump Administration plans to challenge the 2009 “endangerment finding” among many related efforts to repeal and repel policy efforts to protect public health in the U.S.

That’s superior to the median for model-year 2024 EVs, which was reported at 283 miles by the U.S. Energy Department.

The abundant sunrays can provide juice for your EV, and they are applicable for tax breaks, as well.
“The performance breakthrough of sodium-ion batteries is a key development in the full scenario application of batteries,” the CATL statement said.","BEIJING – China-based Contemporary Amperex Technologies, or CATL, is mass-producing sodium-ion batteries, bringing to fruition a technology that has the potential to replace common lithium-ion chemistry, according to a news release from the company.

“With sodium’s inherent safety and abundant reserves, it efficiently reduces dependence on lithium resources and strengthens the foundation of new energy technologies, while promoting energy utilization from ‘single resource dependence’ to ‘energy freedom,'” CATL said in the statement reported by Yahoo News.

Experts worldwide are studying sodium-based batteries for those reasons and others. A lower energy density — or the amount of power the pack can store per pound — compared to lithium has been a holdup, CleanTechnica reported.

CATL’s Naxtra Battery, made for passenger EVs with a version for heavy-duty start-stop use, seems to solve the problem. The passenger pack can provide over 310 miles of range. That’s superior to the median for model-year 2024 EVs, which was reported at 283 miles by the U.S. Energy Department. Those rides are mostly all powered by lithium-ion cells.

The packs can also safely operate between minus 40 degrees and 178 degrees Fahrenheit while maintaining 90% of “usable power” at the coldest mark. It can function for more than 10,000 cycles, all per CATL. New Atlas added that it equates to 3.6 million miles driving before significant capacity loss.

On the heavy-duty side, Naxtra’s 24-volt product is meant to replace lead-acid packs in dirty combustion vehicles, with an eight-year life cycle. There’s also a 61% reduction in costs during that time compared to traditional types.

It’s built to handle frequent restarts for rigs with engines that stop when idling. It’s a fuel-saving trick that’s been in use for more than a decade. The tech made headlines in the April 2011 issue of Car and Driver, for reference. The Naxtra battery is said to be able to fire a start after being idle for a year, all per CATL.

“Compared to lead-acid batteries, it is more efficient, eco-friendly, and economical, driving commercial vehicles into a lead-free era where vehicle and battery age as one,” per the statement.

While that is impressive, fully electric and cleaner haulers are already on the road, including from Tesla. A 24-hour EV rig from Danfoss is being developed in Denmark, among other projects.

Naxtra’s passenger version ideally parks gas burners, preventing planet-warming tailpipe exhaust linked by medical experts to lung, heart, and other health risks, including dementia. Diesel exhaust is “thought to be a likely human carcinogen,” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Sodium chemistry is coming in all sizes, with a huge stationary storage unit recently going online in China. It can store enough renewable energy to power 12,000 homes a day.

Other breakthroughs in various stages of development include lithium iron phosphate and even cannabis cars. As you might guess, the chemistry for the latter pack is unique.

The experts are trying to reduce the tens of millions of tons of deposits that Sustainability by Numbers reported will need to be mined and processed to power clean energy goals by 2040. While that is a lot, it’s nowhere near the 16.5 billion tons of fossil fuels mined annually, per the findings.

Sodium’s abundance and easier extraction could limit the impact of battery-making even more.

However, lithium-ion batteries remain reliable and safe, with rides owned by more people than ever. And now is a great time to buy one stateside, as tax credits to offset the cost are still available. That’s in addition to the loads of cash you can bank annually by eliminating gas and/or maintenance expenses.

Adding a home solar panel system can increase your savings. The abundant sunrays can provide juice for your EV, and they are applicable for tax breaks, as well. EnergySage offers free online support to help you navigate the process and even find an installer.

For CATL’s part, company experts envision a salty future for EVs.

The proposed cuts, embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill, threaten to unravel a project that once symbolized American manufacturing's green-energy pivot. For investors, this is no longer a theoretical debate—it's a critical test of how policy instability is reshaping capital allocation in the EV supply chain. The stakes are high: Ford's Michigan plant, now 60% complete, embodies the risks of tying multibillion-dollar investments to shifting regulatory winds.

The Threat to Ford's Michigan Project: Policy Uncertainty Meets Geopolitical Tensions

The Senate's consideration of the One Big Beautiful Bill—which would end EV tax credits by 2026—directly imperils Ford's Marshall plant. Originally valued at $3.5 billion and poised to create 2,500 jobs, the project has already been scaled back to $2 billion and 1,700 jobs due to reduced state incentives and market headwinds. Now, the plant's viability hinges on whether lawmakers exempt it from the tax credit cuts. .

The plant's reliance on technology from China's CATL—a firm now classified as a “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) under the bill—adds another layer of risk. Ford's partnership with CATL, which provides advanced battery chemistry, has become a geopolitical flashpoint. If the Senate retains FEOC restrictions, the plant could lose eligibility for federal subsidies altogether, despite its strategic role in domestic EV production. Ford's warning that “retroactive policy changes undermine investment confidence” underscores the broader problem: policy instability is deterring capital from long-term EV projects.

Policy Chaos: A Recipe for Supply Chain Fragmentation

The Senate's dithering over tax credits reflects a deeper issue: U.S. energy policy lacks the coherence needed to sustain EV manufacturing competitiveness. The One Big Beautiful Bill's abrupt cuts contrast sharply with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) original vision of a decade-long transition to clean energy. This whiplash creates a high-risk environment for companies like Ford, which must now weigh the costs of U.S. manufacturing—already $2,000 per vehicle due to tariffs—against the possibility of losing subsidies.

The ripple effects extend beyond Ford. Automakers such as Hyundai and General Motors, which similarly depend on federal incentives to meet EV mandates, face production cuts if credits expire. Meanwhile, Tesla, with its brand loyalty and carbon-credit revenue streams, may weather the storm. .

Investment Imperatives: Prioritize Stability, Avoid Regulatory Whiplash

Investors must act decisively to mitigate exposure to policy reversals. Here's the playbook:

Favor Firms with Diversified Supply Chains: Companies like Tesla, which source critical minerals domestically or via stable partnerships, are better insulated from FEOC restrictions.

Advocate for Policy Certainty: Engage with firms pushing for stable incentives—such as those lobbying for IRA extensions or FEOC carve-outs.

Short-Term Plays on Senate Dynamics: Monitor the Senate's July deadline to finalize the bill. If amendments soften tax credit cuts or carve out exemptions for U.S. projects, EV equities could rebound.

Conclusion: Act Before the Senate Acts

The Senate's July vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill is a pivotal moment. Investors who wait risk missing the window to position portfolios for a post-tax-credit landscape. Prioritize firms like Tesla (TSLA) or those with geographically diversified supply chains, while avoiding automakers overly dependent on fading incentives. The Michigan plant's fate is a stark reminder: in the EV race, policy stability is as vital as battery chemistry.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.","On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Pennsylvania if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments in the commonwealth. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Pennsylvania has benefited from just under $3.5 billion in investments in 34 clean energy projects to create more than 7,900 jobs. That’s according to an analysis by Citizens’ Climate Lobby.

An outsized chunk of that investment is in the state’s 15th Congressional District, represented in Congress by Glenn Thompson. Nine projects — eight solar and one for electric transmission lines — have spurred $1.7 billion in investments in PA15 with an estimated 2,550 jobs to be created.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they have been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP.

That success story, however, could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects. Eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades such as rooftop solar is a blow to Pennsylvanians who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a giant boost to the commonwealth’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will be a $65 billion economic boost to our state in the next 10 years and support more than 35,000 in full-time jobs in Pennsylvania annually.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican Senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits work for Pennsylvania. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators David McCormick and John Fetterman to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/sxa7pe/picture307169911/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/37693e1d-71c5-489a-9ce3-3d0d0ee9a9a1,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:02.480858

Eguana Technologies Inc. (EGT:TSX.V; EGTYF:OTC)

In a release, BC Hydro said its new Peak Saver project will offer uninterrupted power to customers while strengthening the flexibility of the electricity grid.

The company said this spring, the installation of 200 Eguana residential batteries begins in Sun Peaks, near Kamloops, and Harrison Mills in Mission. The batteries are able to coordinate and switch to backup during power outages and supply stored energy to others during peak demand.

BC Hydro will manage the operation of the Eguana Technologies Evolve LFP 14kWh/5kW batteries remotely to ensure optimal performance during high demand.

""This important project will help us better understand how batteries can mitigate outages and help keep costs low for customers by potentially deferring the need for additional, costly capital infrastructure in certain constrained regions and areas,"" said Chris O'Riley, president and chief executive officer of BC Hydro. ""Virtual power plants are expected to play an important role in supporting electrical grids in the future, making electricity systems more resilient and flexible.""

VPPs use smart batteries at the edge of the grid (the homes and businesses that consume the energy) tied to software that helps distribute and store energy in the batteries when it's not needed and makes it available to the grid at peak times. ""The process is seamless to the consumer,"" Eguana Chief Executive Officer Justin Holland said.

'Groundbreaking Approach' to Energy Management

Adrian Dix, minister of Energy and Climate Solutions for the province, said VPPs are a ""groundbreaking approach to test the future of energy management and build a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable power grid overall.""

""This exciting Power Smart project reaffirms BC Hydro's dedication to expanding new and dynamic energy solutions and technology to redefine how communities manage and consume energy in the future,"" he said.

BC Hydro's Peak Saver programs have seen a surge in participation, the utility said, doubling since October 2024 to over 100,000 members today with Port Coquitlam, Kelowna, and Victoria leading the way in engagement. Collectively, participants have contributed to 40 megawatts (MW) in demand savings — equivalent to charging more than 40,000 electric vehicles.

Through its Peak Saver program, BC Hydro customers can also receive bill credits by reducing electricity use during brief periods of high demand, known as peak events.

""By adjusting energy consumption, participants help demand on the system while earning financial rewards,"" BC Hydro noted in its release.

Incentive options are also available, such as the Peak Saver Challenge and smart home device enrollment for things like smart thermostats, electric vehicle charges, load controllers, and home batteries.

Both the battery storage project and the Peak Saver program are part of BC Hydro’s CA$700 million expanded Energy Efficiency Plan, which increases investments in tools, technology, programs, and rebates for customers over the next three years.

Growing Interest Among Utilities for DERMS

Each installed system contributes monthly recurring revenue for Eguana through its integrated software and hardware platforms. The Evolve hardware is paired with Eguana's Exchange and Edge cloud platforms, which enable system-level control via a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS). The utility's DERMS software partner manages this grid support through coordinated charge and discharge cycles.

In addition to the progress in British Columbia, Eguana recently completed fleet-level demand response testing with a utility retailer in California. The company is also finalizing a summer rollout in Alberta to support a constrained feeder and has been invited to submit a proposal for an upcoming utility program in Ontario.

Holland has noted growing interest in integrated battery and DERMS solutions among utilities, stating, ""We can certainly feel a change in the air as more utilities move towards advanced batteries... to manage near term capacity and demand peak constraints on the grid.""

*""The rickety traditional centralized grid structure is at or close to its limits and requires transformation,"" wrote Technical Analyst Clive Maund about the company on March 24. ""The advantages of this transformation will be huge — a massive increase in capacity, vastly more efficient utilization of power generated, decreased demand on centralized power generation, and protection of the end user, corporate or private, from power outages.""

Maund said he viewed the stock as having an ""exceptionally positive risk/reward ratio"" and rated it a Strong Buy for all time horizons, with targets of CA$0.20; CA$0.60, CA$0.70, CA$1, or CA$2.

The Catalyst: Grid Stress

This summer, experts say Americans have a higher risk of finding themselves without power as extreme weather and increasing pressure from artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers could stress the grid, according to a report by The Washington Post's Evan Halper recently.

The nonprofit regulatory authority that monitors the electricity system, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., or NERC, is dedicated to reducing risks to power networks, he wrote. It said power demand is sharply up since last summer, increasing at more than double the rate it did between 2023 and 2024.

""The U.S. is now projected to need 10 gigawatts (GW) more electricity in the upcoming summer season than it did last summer — the equivalent amount of power it takes to keep the lights on in as many as 10 million homes,"" Halper wrote. ""The proliferation of energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing plants is a key cause. They are consuming energy faster than utilities can bring new power plants online. Additionally, scorching temperatures drive more air-conditioning use in homes and businesses, creating a major strain on electricity systems.""

An electrical transformer recently sent Europe's busiest airport into darkness, affecting nearly 300,000 passengers, diverting or canceling more than 1,400 flights, and costing airlines an estimated 100 million pounds in lost revenue and passenger care expenses.

Flights at London's Heathrow Airport were able to resume the next day. While the cause was ruled either human error or equipment malfunction, the incident drew attention to aging electrical grids.

Adding to the fears are recent reports that U.S. government officials have found undisclosed communication devices on the power inverters of some Chinese-manufactured solar panels that could switch them off remotely, according to a report published by Reuters.

That is what Laura Burke, the Director General of the EPA, said when she launched the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections Report last Wednesday.","Confirmation from the Environmental Protection Agency over the past few days that Ireland has gone backwards on its greenhouse gas emissions targets is hugely disappointing.

People are blue in the face, listening to government ministers and policy makers constantly highlighting the important of climate action and their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Now however, the EPA has let the cat out of the bag.

Despite all that talk, the gap to where Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions must be by 2030 is widening.

And it is not widening by a little. It is widening by a lot.

The legally binding target is for Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions to be 51% lower, in 2030, than they were in 2018.

A year ago, EPA analysis suggested that if every realistic climate policy in the Climate Action Plan was delivered on time, ahead of 2030, it might be possible to cut emissions by 29%, at most.

Now, after receiving updates from Government departments and agencies, the EPA says the maximum reduction achievable, is only 23%.

Either number - a cut of 23% or 29% - represents a massive failure.

There is the global warming potential, and the climate damage, caused by not cutting emissions fast enough.

But there is also a huge cost to the taxpayer.

Recent analysis from the Irish Fiscal Council and the Climate Change Advisory Council suggested it could cost the taxpayer up to €26 billion for carbon credits by 2030, to make up the shortfall envisaged last year.

But now that the emissions gap is bigger, the bill to the taxpayer will be bigger too.

This feels like some kind of disaster unfolding in slow motion.

The focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation

The key reason is that despite all the talk from politicians there is not enough focus on implementing and delivering the climate-related policies the government has signed up to.

That is what Laura Burke, the Director General of the EPA, said when she launched the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections Report last Wednesday.

""This highlights the economy-wide effort needed to decarbonise our society and the focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation.""

That was how she put it.

A key paragraph on page 10 of the EPA report, goes right to the heart of why we are going backwards.

Know first, that these latest emissions projections were done on the basis of the official ""Climate Action Plan 2024"", published at the end of 2023.

On page 10 the EPA report explains that: ""Climate Action Plan 2025 is not specifically referenced in this report as it had yet to be published during the preparation phase of the 2024-2055 projections. A review was undertaken and there are no significant additional measures in CAP 2025 therefore no major omissions in these projections.""

What this paragraph is saying is that, with so few years to go before the crucial 2030 deadline, an entire year has been allowed to pass without a single important climate initiative, or effort, having been added to the policy mix.

Yet there is no time to waste.

Notwithstanding the need to constantly come up with new policy initiatives, the number one thing should be to deliver, as quickly as possible, on the climate- related commitments already made.

Delaying difficult but inevitable changes only makes them harder to implement. It will not make them go away.

'Sustainable transport'

Climate Action Plan 2023 introduced a so-called ""Avoid-Shift"" policy on transport. The aim was to introduce behavioural change and sustainable transport measures to save 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Central to that was a commitment to increase the price of petrol and diesel out to 2030 to encourage people to choose other modes of transport.

So far there is no sign of any willingness by Government to follow through on that.

But if they are not going to do it, what are they going to do instead to deliver the promised emissions reduction?

Last year the target was 945,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030. This year the EPA says the maximum possible is 640,750.

Many observers doubt even that amount can be achieved - especially since tax incentives to encourage electric vehicle purchases have been reduced in recent years.

What will the Government do to address that?

There is also a commitment in the Climate Action Plan to use behavioural and sustainable transport measures to engineer a reduction in total vehicle kilometres travelled. We are still waiting for that, and very much more.

Time is running out for climate action. We have one year less to go to an immovable deadline in 2030.

The clear message from the EPA this week is that government inaction is the core of the problem and the potential bill for the public, which is already enormous, is rising by the day.",https://www.rte.ie/images/0014c4b3-1600.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 13:10:15.888275

were also plaintiffs in a climate suit filed against the state of Montana.","A group of young people — as young as 7 and as old as 25 — are suing the Trump administration to stop its assault on renewable energy and climate action.

Executive orders President Donald Trump signed to promote fossil fuels amount to an “unconstitutional” overreach of power, they allege in a complaint filed Thursday at a US District Court in Montana. The 22 plaintiffs also claim that by increasing pollution and denying climate science, the president’s actions violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty.

It’s the latest high-profile case brought against governments by youth concerned about how fossil fuel pollution and climate change poses risks to their health and ability to thrive as they grow up.

Two brothers, aged 11 and 7, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations”

Two brothers, aged 11 and 7 and named “J.K.” and “N.K.” in the suit, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations and which compromise their health,” the complaint says.

They grew up mostly in Montana but now live in Southern California, and the suit says wildfire smoke has encroached on their lives from state to state. J.K. was born with an abnormal mass of lung tissue and “experienced nosebleeds, sore throats, headaches, tiredness, coughing, trouble breathing, and eye irritation from wildfire smoke,” according to the suit. N.K. has “frequent” upper respiratory infections that have led to emergency room visits. They’ve both missed school days and camp because of feeling sick from smoke and soot in the air from wildfires, it says.

Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels trap heat, and rising temperatures have contributed to longer fire seasons in the western US. With hotter, drier conditions, the area burned by forest fires in the western US doubled between 1984 and 2015.

“Every additional ton of [greenhouse gas] pollution and increment of heat Defendants cause will cause J.K. and N.K. more days of poor air quality, more smoke, and thus, more harm to their lives, health, and safety,” the complaint adds.

In recent years, scientists have been trying to better understand the long-term health impact of wildfire smoke, which previously hadn’t been studied as thoroughly as pollution from other sources thought to be more consistent problems, like factories and highways. Now, chronic exposure to wildfire smoke is a growing concern. Wildfire smoke is considered a neurotoxin estimated to be more harmful than other common air pollutants, but its effects on the body can vary depending on what kinds of materials burn and how chemicals released by the fire interact with other substances in the atmosphere.

After campaigning on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and accepting more than $75 million in contributions from oil and gas interests, Trump signed executive orders on his first day in office declaring a purported “national energy emergency,” directing federal agencies to “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production and promote the use of gas-powered vehicles over EVs. He signed another executive order to “reinvigorat[e]” the coal industry in April. Coal releases more planet-heating pollution when burned than other fossil fuels and has struggled to compete with cheaper sources of electricity.

The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief to block implementation of those executive orders and to declare them unconstitutional. They also claim that Trump lacks the authority to erode environmental protections passed by Congress under the Clean Air Act. The administration’s efforts to impede scientific research and remove climate information from federal websites amounts to “censorship” and denies plaintiffs access to resources they might otherwise be able to use to minimize risks they face from climate change, the suit alleges.

In response to the lawsuit, White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said in an email to The Verge, “The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the lefts’ radical climate agenda.”

The plaintiffs, who hail from Montana, Oregon, Hawai‘i, California, and Florida, are represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which has also represented young people in similar climate cases. A federal appellate court dismissed another case that youth filed against the Obama administration in 2015 over fossil fuel pollution causing climate change, and the US Supreme Court ended that legal battle this year when it declined to hear an appeal.

But there have also been some wins. A group of youth reached a settlement last year with the state of Hawai‘i and its Department of Transportation that commits them to a plan to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 2045. J.K. and N.K. were also plaintiffs in a climate suit filed against the state of Montana. Last year, Montana’s Supreme Court upheld a district judge ruling affirming their right to a clean and healthy environment and rejecting policies that had barred officials from considering the consequences of climate change when permitting new energy projects.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_C.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-31 08:01:39.382486

John Curtis over his support for clean energy tax credits, raising the stakes for Republican leaders as they scramble to pass their massive tax reconciliation bill.

The fiscally conservative group will launch an ad series this weekend targeting a handful of GOP lawmakers over their policy stances at odds with President Donald Trump’s massive budget framework. The ad taking aim at Curtis specifically focuses on his support for preserving some green energy tax incentives passed under the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Republicans were elected up and down the ballot in 2024 to reverse disastrous Biden policies — not protect them,” said Club for Growth President David McIntosh. “If the tax cut bill fails because John Curtis is against it in order to protect Biden giveaways, every family in Utah will be hit with the largest tax increase in history. We are confident his constituents in Utah will remind Sen. Curtis how misguided his approach is.”

The 30-second ad, which will run statewide beginning on Sunday, claims Curtis is threatening Trump’s plans to reverse former President Joe Biden’s signature climate policies.

The commercial specifically refers to the 1,038-page megabill making its way through Congress seeking to advance Trump’s policies on the border, energy production, national defense and more. The budget resolution also contains extensions for a slew of tax cuts set to expire at the end of this year.

The budget package greenlights about $4.5 trillion to extend the tax cuts previously approved in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and make them permanent. To offset those costs, lawmakers must find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts elsewhere.

However, internal disagreements on where to cut spending has delayed progress on the bill as some Republicans push for deep cuts while others caution against them.

One of the most controversial provisions tucked into the budget resolution is language repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration with only Democratic support.

Curtis is among those pushing to preserve some of those policies, particularly those dealing with nuclear energy, net-zero emissions, battery storage and more. The first-term senator has long centered his climate policies on clean energy solutions, suggesting earlier this week he will push for those changes as the Senate considers the bill.

“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators,” a spokesperson for Curtis told the Deseret News. “Doing otherwise risks freezing investment, delaying domestic production, increasing costs, and forfeiting our energy edge and national security to China and Russia.”

The Club for Growth has previously targeted Curtis, spending millions of dollars on ad campaigns claiming the Utah senator is not conservative enough. But Curtis contends those big-money efforts by national groups have only boosted his message — arguing his victories over the last eight years have been a result of Utah voters rejecting out-of-state meddling in local elections.

The ad campaign targets other Republicans who have threatened to vote against Trump’s megabill, such as New York Reps. Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota, who pushed for expansions to federal deductions for state and local taxes paid, also known as SALT.

While LaLota and Lawler have outright said they would vote against the reconciliation package if it didn’t include those demands, Curtis has so far stopped short of saying he would reject the budget framework if it nixed green energy credits. Still, the Utah senator said he would fight to include them in the final bill.",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AYDJBAGBHNG2HNDDQLPUSFJCZA.JPG?focal=1498%2C609&auth=84ca080f00c1759126af5be6043a6bc261ad727cab9e0901287781cedf1a57ce&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-05-31 08:01:35.383555

The first is the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER).
All told, Shapiro’s climate plans would soak Pennsylvanians with more than $157 billion in higher energy costs.
And when job creators face higher costs, they must cut back on hires, wages, and benefits.
He was right when he expressed concerns about RGGI’s harm to Pennsylvania families.","Gov. Josh Shapiro is a classic political flip-flopper. And his latest energy proposals demonstrate his wishy-washiness.

When he ran for the state’s highest office in 2022, Shapiro said he had “real concerns” about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—the signature climate policy of his predecessor. He said he was worried the carbon-tax scheme could hit Pennsylvania families with higher costs, which it will. RGGI is expected to raise residential electric bills by 30% by 2030, killing at least 22,000 jobs in the process.

But three years later, the governor is singing a different tune. On May 13, in front of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, his administration and other environmental organizations argued that Shapiro should have the power to keep RGGI in place. So much for those “real concerns.” And forget the real damage RGGI will do to families and job creators across the commonwealth.

If Shapiro had meant what he said about RGGI’s harm, his administration would not have sought to reverse the lower court’s decision to strike it down. Instead, he proudly stands by RGGI. And that’s just the start of Josh Shapiro’s flip-flopping. Despite his worries that RGGI would make life more expensive, the governor is pushing his own Pennsylvania Green New Deal that would, just like RGGI, make life more expensive and threaten to undermine Pennsylvania’s energy leadership.

Even as he defends RGGI in court, Shapiro has called for two new climate-inspired plans. The first is the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER). PACER is essentially RGGI 2.0 and would enact a new system of carbon taxes that would still affect everyone in the state. The second is the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS), which is neither reliable nor sustainable. PRESS would force the state to expand its generation mix with more mandated unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.

RGGI is harmful to Pennsylvania, but the governor’s new plan is even worse. He’s doubling down on the unreliable and unaffordable energy sources that drive costs even higher.

In a new study from the Commonwealth Foundation, we estimate that PACER and PRESS would cause a 60% rate hike across all sectors over the next 10 years. By 2035, the typical family would see a 102% increase in their household electricity bills. All told, Shapiro’s climate plans would soak Pennsylvanians with more than $157 billion in higher energy costs.

This would be an unmitigated—and totally preventable—disaster. When families pay more for utilities, they have less to spend on the things that matter most to them: a new home, a better school for their kids, their grocery budget, you name it. And when job creators face higher costs, they must cut back on hires, wages, and benefits. They also cut back on innovations and investments, like the new and improved factories that Pennsylvania needs to stay competitive.

Shapiro is darkening the state’s future—both figuratively and literally. His climate-alarmist energy plans will limit the construction of needed power plants that produce affordable and reliable energy, forcing the closure of reliable plants already on the grid. All of this at a time when we have increasing energy demands across the region and nation.

None of this would have happened if the governor had abandoned his policy contradictions and embraced energy realism rather than climate alarmism. He was right when he expressed concerns about RGGI’s harm to Pennsylvania families. The governor should abandon his PACER and PRESS plans, based on his frequent claims that he’s trying to save families money and wants Pennsylvania to continue as an energy leader.

In contrast, Josh Shapiro can keep pushing for a Pennsylvania version of the Green New Deal that will hurt the commonwealth and everyone who calls it home.

It would be better to stop the flip-flopping and start putting Pennsylvania first.

With this law, Massachusetts joins leaders like California and New York in boosting clean energy adoption.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that effective energy storage can reduce system costs.
These solutions can also cut down land use and water needs, making clean energy more environmentally friendly.
Challenges Facing Massachusetts Energy Storage Deployment Challenges like technology readiness, interconnection delays, and permitting risks might slow progress.","Massachusetts has passed a bold energy storage mandate. It requires investor-owned utilities to secure 5,000 megawatts (MW) of storage by 2030. This includes 3,500 MW of mid-duration, 750 MW of long-duration, and another 750 MW for multi-day storage. The goal is to modernize the grid and integrate renewable energy fully.

The state’s Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and electric distribution companies (EDCs) have released a draft request for proposals (RFP), expressing interest to buy 1,500 MW of mid-duration battery energy storage systems (BESS).

By locking in contracts early, the state wants a resilient energy system to handle solar and wind power fluctuations. Since renewables generate power intermittently, storage systems are vital for grid stability. The new law urges utilities to secure agreements quickly and cuts red tape by streamlining permitting and siting processes.

How Energy Storage Will Maximize Renewable Energy in Massachusetts

This mandate aims to boost renewable energy use and reduce curtailment, which is wasted clean power. By investing in storage, the state can save renewable electricity produced during sunny or windy periods. It can then use that power when needed.

Data shows that states with clear storage mandates adopt renewables 25% faster than those without. With this law, Massachusetts joins leaders like California and New York in boosting clean energy adoption.

The streamlined approval process also helps speed up clean energy project construction. Stakeholders see this as a game-changing step toward increasing renewable use while maintaining grid reliability.

This law supports the U.S. goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. Long-duration and multi-day storage systems prevent waste of renewable energy when generation is low. Instead of relying on fossil fuels, utilities can use stored clean energy.

Storage cuts the need for “Peaker plants” that emit high carbon during peak demand. This rule, along with other clean energy investments, boosts the state’s climate action efforts.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that effective energy storage can reduce system costs. And this can be possible by improving the use of renewable energy. These solutions can also cut down land use and water needs, making clean energy more environmentally friendly.

Growth Opportunities for Battery and Long-Duration Technologies

This mandate sends a strong message to developers and investors. With a clear goal of 5,000 MW by 2030 and a solid procurement plan, Massachusetts stands out as a prime market for energy storage technologies like lithium-ion, flow batteries, iron-air systems, and thermal storage.

Experts predict U.S. storage capacity will triple by 2030. Massachusetts provides the policy certainty that attracts investment and encourages competition among developers. The state’s mixed approach to mid- and long-duration goals reflects a savvy understanding of energy demand and supply trends.

By combining firm storage targets with faster permitting, Massachusetts sets the stage for rapid deployment—a model for other states.

Challenges Facing Massachusetts Energy Storage Deployment

Challenges like technology readiness, interconnection delays, and permitting risks might slow progress. While the law cuts some bureaucratic barriers, stakeholders must balance speed with oversight.

Cost is another concern. Storage technology costs are higher than some traditional grid solutions. However, NREL expects prices to drop by 2030, especially for long-duration systems. Achieving this goal relies on innovation, market growth, and good investment conditions.

The law boosts Massachusetts’ role in the national clean energy shift. It also urges utilities to act quickly and effectively.

What Do Consumers and the Economy Gain?

Energy storage can lower electricity bills. It does this by stabilizing prices during peak demand. The law also brings economic benefits. It creates jobs in clean tech. This includes roles in manufacturing, engineering, installation, and maintenance as new projects start.

Massachusetts combines clean energy, grid reliability, and economic growth for lasting success. If done right, this policy can guide other states in modernizing their energy systems sustainably and cost-effectively.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1625103661-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:49.390640

The emergence of the EV sector and the subsequent popularity that companies like Tesla found on the global market place was all the evidence we needed.
The problems that most African nations face always comes back to the people suffering, in this instance its the infrastructure.
How have Ethiopia and East Africa become the global leaders in the EV sector?
It comes down to the fact that the African nations like Ethiopia have incentivized the EV sector heavily.","EAST AFRICA – The world’s first country to commit to 100% EVs has been unveiled and it does not come from where you expect. Of all the nations in the world that spend a lot of time talking about zero emissions and what we should be doing for the planet, Ethiopia is the last place on earth you would expect to ban the import of all gasoline powered vehicles.

Yet they have. East Africa overall has experienced a surge in investments and the nations are leaps and bounds ahead of their American or European counterparts at achieving the world’s zero emission goals.

What is the history of the electric vehicle in Africa?

Africa has always had the same problem with EV’s, infrastructure. In a continent where most people survive on a fraction of what the American earns, costs mean a lot to people. A vehicle that costs nothing to refuel and only needs the electricity from your house that you were already lucky to have was a no brainer. Africans love anything that can save money in their every day lives.

The emergence of the EV sector and the subsequent popularity that companies like Tesla found on the global market place was all the evidence we needed. The problems that most African nations face always comes back to the people suffering, in this instance its the infrastructure. With most African countries having dodgy electricity infrastructure at best, the EV struggled to find a home in Africa.

But all that is slowly(admittedly) changing. The world’s nations have all committed to a zero emission future and Ethiopia have gone further then any other nation at actually achieving it. The reason for this comes down to a few factors, chief among which is that the African economies are booming. Africa has a young population and the new generation expect different things from their governments and car manufacturers.

How have Ethiopia and East Africa become the global leaders in the EV sector?

It comes down to the fact that the African nations like Ethiopia have incentivized the EV sector heavily. They have seen the EV sector as an opportunity to lead the world. The thing is that Africa is not as dependent on gasoline as the rest of the world. In some African countries you might struggle to find gasoline even. So the opportunity is there to invest in the new infrastructure that was going to be built anyway, why not make it for EV’s?

That seems to be what Ethiopia have thought. They have officially announced that as of January 2024, they have banned the import of combustion-powered vehicles. A driving factor was certainly the countries heavy fuel bill. Ethiopia’s rapid economic growth is the fastest among all African countries south of the Sahara and this had led to huge foreign investments into the EV sector for the future.

Local African EV makers are emerging as well. Kiira Motors (Uganda), Kantanka (Ghana), and Innoson Motors (Nigeria) have all seen steady growth and will no doubt welcome the electrification of the roads in Africa. While America and Europe face the same old problems, Africa is leading the world in the embracement and implementation of the EV market.

Will Africa continue to lead the global electrification efforts towards zero emissions?

The world faces a very dark and slow future of we do not find a solution to the energy crisis, some countries have looked towards alternative fuel sources as a potential answer. The truth is that the world has the infrastructure already in place. The majority of the world have electricity in some form for their citizens, even if its only in the larger cities or built up areas, so why not improve it and use to for our mobility needs? The governments of the world treat their car owners very differently, and Ethiopia has just made their message clear, they will only except EV’s from this point onwards. And so should you.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-electricity-demand-for-EVs-to-skyrocket-630-by-2030-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:20:44.134914

Two years and $7.6 billion later, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America started production of the 2025 Ioniq 5 in Georgia, almost half a year earlier than expected.
The same is true for the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the second EV model produced at the Metaplant America.
Besides the car plant, Hyundai partnered with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to build a $4 billion battery plant, which should start supplying battery cells for the Ioniq models in 2026.
The tariffs that Trump has imposed on most imports will also make it harder to operate a car factory.","Hyundai is one of the legacy carmakers that has moved the fastest in the new EV era. The Ioniq 5 has been hailed as one of the most advanced EVs for the masses, thanks to its 800-volt E-GMP architecture. However, soon after Hyundai started exporting the Ioniq 5 from its home factory in Korea, the Biden administration announced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) with huge incentives for EV buyers and carmakers. However, the cars and most of their parts must be sourced from North America to qualify.

Hyundai suffered a lot, and sales of the Ioniq 5 dropped, even though many buyers used the lease loophole to access the tax credit. Luckily, Hyundai was already planning a new factory in the US, and the groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for October 2022, two months after the IRA was signed. Two years and $7.6 billion later, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America started production of the 2025 Ioniq 5 in Georgia, almost half a year earlier than expected.

The American-made Ioniq 5 has the NACS charge port pioneered by Tesla as its most distinctive feature. This allows it to charge at Tesla Superchargers, even though Hyundai E-GMP vehicles don't charge very fast at 400-volt chargers. The same is true for the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the second EV model produced at the Metaplant America.

Besides the car plant, Hyundai partnered with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to build a $4 billion battery plant, which should start supplying battery cells for the Ioniq models in 2026. Hyundai is not putting all the eggs in one basket, which is why it will open a second battery plant in Georgia, this time in partnership with SK On, following a $5 billion investment. All these plants are part of a massive $21 billion investment plan, most of the investments pledged during the EV-friendly Biden administration.

However, things are changing fast, and although Trump still says he wants businesses to set up production facilities on US soil, his actions point to the opposite. The administration is now working to scrap IRA from 2026, meaning that many of these investments will be much more difficult to recover, if not impossible.

The tariffs that Trump has imposed on most imports will also make it harder to operate a car factory. Vehicle manufacturing is incredibly complex, and no company, not even Tesla, can produce a car without some share of imported parts. The added costs will put pressure on Hyundai's bottom line and raise car prices for everyone.

Hyundai has an important advantage here, as its Metaplant is almost fully operated by robots. Only 1,340 employees work at the plant, with initial plans to hire up to 8,500 at full capacity. Local suppliers and businesses will require another 7,000 jobs. However, things might change, and Hyundai might need fewer workers instead of more. To compete in current conditions, Hyundai will accelerate the adoption of robots, while the factory will be mostly operated by artificial intelligence.

Hyundai bought Boston Dynamics in 2020 and already uses Spot robotic dogs to enforce quality control. Soon, these will be joined by Atlas humanoid robots, able to work tirelessly, 24 hours a day. However, the robot revolution is already obvious at the plant. The welding shop uses 475 industrial robots, and many more work at the steel stamping plant, while robotic arms install car doors on the final assembly line.

This makes Hyundai's factory less of a boon for employees or even Georgia state, which invested taxpayers' money thinking about the jobs it could create. Despite plans to build 500,000 cars at the factory, far fewer jobs than expected will be needed. Ultimately, Hyundai will face a daunting job to make everyone happy while still running a successful business. However, it's more likely that everyone will be unhappy with the outcome.

To be fair, this is the direction every carmaker will take if it wants to survive, although it will be easier for some than others. Robotic production lines are nothing new, but humanoid robots will turn car factories, or any factory for that matter, into human-unfriendly environments. Carmakers may take different routes, but the destination is the same.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/hyundai-invested-76-billion-in-a-state-of-the-art-plant-that-will-make-nobody-happy-252147_1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-31 11:03:32.783368

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending Prototype 2.0 successfully restored 100% of imbalance-related capacity on a real-world 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, demonstrating precise cell-level voltage alignment and effective capacity recovery.

1.95 ampere-hours (Ah) of capacity was restored, representing a 3.9% increase in effective capacity on a battery pack that was relatively well-balanced, underscoring the system's potential on more degraded packs.

All 96 battery cells were rebalanced to 4.20 volts, the industry-recognized full charge state for lithium-ion batteries, validating the system's accuracy and performance.

Results support the potential scalability of Prototype 2.0 across high-volume EV platforms. The next phase of validation includes full charge/discharge testing to confirm capacity gains and assess long-term battery lifespan extension.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that, further to its news release dated May 2, 2025 confirming the delivery of its second-generation, patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") by its wholly owned subsidiary Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), and its news releases dated May 23, 2025 and May 27, 2025, regarding expanded development efforts to achieve compatibility with the Nissan Leaf -the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle (EV) in the United States-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has achieved full capacity recovery in a preliminary trial (the ""Trial"") on a retired real-world imbalanced 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, composed of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium nickel oxide (LNO) materials (the ""Nissan Leaf Battery Pack"").

The Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Prototype 2.0 on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack, The Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was first charged at 12 amperes using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' cycling module to simulate a standard electric vehicle charging cycle. Once the first cell reached the voltage target of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""), a rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was applied individually to the remaining cells until all 96-battery cells successfully reached the Voltage Target. The Voltage Target lies within the standard operating range for LMO and LNO lithium-ion cells of 3.0 volts to 4.20 volts, with 4.20 volts commonly recognized as the full capacity in the industry¹.

According to the diagnostic report provided by the vendor of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack (the ""Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report""), the reported measured effective ampere-hour capacity of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack prior to rebalancing was 50.34 ampere-hours (Ah). This served as the baseline capacity for the Trial. Following the Trial, Prototype 2.0's integrated software determined that 1.95 Ah of additional capacity had been successfully restored. While the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report did not quantitatively indicate a loss of capacity, it indicated that the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was operating at 50.34 Ah with minor voltage imbalance that placed the voltage below the Voltage Target. Rebalancing the cells to the Voltage Target achieved a 3.9 percent improvement in usable capacity.

The restored 1.95 Ah corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing increase based on the Voltage Target achieved, and represents full recovery of the minor voltage imbalance indicated on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report. These results were determined by the Trial based on achieving the Voltage Target across all 96-battery cells, along with a software feature of Prototype 2.0 that shows the ampere-hours (Ah) capacity restored through rebalancing for each individual cell, with the largest discrepancy being 1.95 Ah, based on the Voltage Target. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets this result as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing.

Results

Next Steps

To further validate the Results, the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies intends to conduct further trials to complete a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm whether the 50.34 ampere-hour capacity reported in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report remains consistent following rebalancing. Given that all 96-battery cells have been rebalanced to the Voltage Target, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies does not anticipate any material variance, and remains confident in its ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack. However, this process will provide definitive confirmation.

Additionally, the full charge/discharge cycle will help identify any potentially defective battery cells within the pack that may require replacement. While there is currently no indication of any defective cells, this diagnostic step will serve as a further safeguard in confirming the measured effective ampere-hour capacity stated in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies continues to rely on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report as a credible third-party baseline and has no reason to believe it is inaccurate. Nevertheless, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to validate the report through its own independent testing protocols to ensure accuracy.

Developing Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

""This Trial marks a significant milestone in validating Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' technology under real-world conditions,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""Even with a relatively well-balanced Nissan Leaf battery pack, the system was able to recover nearly 2 ampere-hours of capacity - an improvement that underscores the precision and potential of our patent-pending lithium-ion rebalancing solution. As we expand testing to more aged and imbalanced battery packs, we expect to identify greater capacity losses that this technology is specifically designed to address. This is just the beginning of what battery rebalancing can offer the EV ecosystem - extending battery life, improving performance, and reducing waste.""

As disclosed in the Company's May 9, 2025 news release, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies entered into a non-commercial, collaborative scope of services agreement (the ""Factor E Agreement"") with Factor E Motors, an automobile service centre specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles. The collaboration is focused on advancing the Company's patent-pending rebalancing software and hardware, with initial efforts targeting Tesla Model 3 and Model X battery packs in Factor E's possession.

Further to the Company's May 23, 2025 news release, development efforts were expanded to include functionality for the Nissan Leaf-the second most common out-of-warranty EV model in the United States. The Results were attained from Trials performed on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack acquired from an arm's-length third party for $1,120.

The Trial was performed in collaboration with Factor E Motors, and in addition to conducting a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' is now focused on ongoing validation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and post-rebalancing processes.

News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending Prototype 2.0 successfully restored 100% of imbalance-related capacity on a real-world 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, demonstrating precise cell-level voltage alignment and effective capacity recovery.

1.95 ampere-hours (Ah) of capacity was restored, representing a 3.9% increase in effective capacity on a battery pack that was relatively well-balanced, underscoring the system's potential on more degraded packs.

All 96 battery cells were rebalanced to 4.20 volts, the industry-recognized full charge state for lithium-ion batteries, validating the system's accuracy and performance.

Results support the potential scalability of Prototype 2.0 across high-volume EV platforms. The next phase of validation includes full charge/discharge testing to confirm capacity gains and assess long-term battery lifespan extension.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that, further to its news release dated May 2, 2025 confirming the delivery of its second-generation, patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") by its wholly owned subsidiary Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), and its news releases dated May 23, 2025 and May 27, 2025, regarding expanded development efforts to achieve compatibility with the Nissan Leaf -the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle (EV) in the United States-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has achieved full capacity recovery in a preliminary trial (the ""Trial"") on a retired real-world imbalanced 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, composed of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium nickel oxide (LNO) materials (the ""Nissan Leaf Battery Pack"").

The Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Prototype 2.0 on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack, The Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was first charged at 12 amperes using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' cycling module to simulate a standard electric vehicle charging cycle. Once the first cell reached the voltage target of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""), a rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was applied individually to the remaining cells until all 96-battery cells successfully reached the Voltage Target. The Voltage Target lies within the standard operating range for LMO and LNO lithium-ion cells of 3.0 volts to 4.20 volts, with 4.20 volts commonly recognized as the full capacity in the industry¹.

According to the diagnostic report provided by the vendor of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack (the ""Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report""), the reported measured effective ampere-hour capacity of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack prior to rebalancing was 50.34 ampere-hours (Ah). This served as the baseline capacity for the Trial. Following the Trial, Prototype 2.0's integrated software determined that 1.95 Ah of additional capacity had been successfully restored. While the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report did not quantitatively indicate a loss of capacity, it indicated that the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was operating at 50.34 Ah with minor voltage imbalance that placed the voltage below the Voltage Target. Rebalancing the cells to the Voltage Target achieved a 3.9 percent improvement in usable capacity.

The restored 1.95 Ah corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing increase based on the Voltage Target achieved, and represents full recovery of the minor voltage imbalance indicated on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report. These results were determined by the Trial based on achieving the Voltage Target across all 96-battery cells, along with a software feature of Prototype 2.0 that shows the ampere-hours (Ah) capacity restored through rebalancing for each individual cell, with the largest discrepancy being 1.95 Ah, based on the Voltage Target. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets this result as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing.

Results

Next Steps

To further validate the Results, the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies intends to conduct further trials to complete a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm whether the 50.34 ampere-hour capacity reported in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report remains consistent following rebalancing. Given that all 96-battery cells have been rebalanced to the Voltage Target, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies does not anticipate any material variance, and remains confident in its ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack. However, this process will provide definitive confirmation.

Additionally, the full charge/discharge cycle will help identify any potentially defective battery cells within the pack that may require replacement. While there is currently no indication of any defective cells, this diagnostic step will serve as a further safeguard in confirming the measured effective ampere-hour capacity stated in the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies continues to rely on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report as a credible third-party baseline and has no reason to believe it is inaccurate. Nevertheless, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to validate the report through its own independent testing protocols to ensure accuracy.

Developing Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

""This Trial marks a significant milestone in validating Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' technology under real-world conditions,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""Even with a relatively well-balanced Nissan Leaf battery pack, the system was able to recover nearly 2 ampere-hours of capacity - an improvement that underscores the precision and potential of our patent-pending lithium-ion rebalancing solution. As we expand testing to more aged and imbalanced battery packs, we expect to identify greater capacity losses that this technology is specifically designed to address. This is just the beginning of what battery rebalancing can offer the EV ecosystem - extending battery life, improving performance, and reducing waste.""

As disclosed in the Company's May 9, 2025 news release, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies entered into a non-commercial, collaborative scope of services agreement (the ""Factor E Agreement"") with Factor E Motors, an automobile service centre specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles. The collaboration is focused on advancing the Company's patent-pending rebalancing software and hardware, with initial efforts targeting Tesla Model 3 and Model X battery packs in Factor E's possession.

Further to the Company's May 23, 2025 news release, development efforts were expanded to include functionality for the Nissan Leaf-the second most common out-of-warranty EV model in the United States. The Results were attained from Trials performed on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack acquired from an arm's-length third party for $1,120.

The Trial was performed in collaboration with Factor E Motors, and in addition to conducting a full charge/discharge cycle to empirically confirm the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' is now focused on ongoing validation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and post-rebalancing processes. This includes conducting pre- and post-rebalancing diagnostics and supporting the execution of the rebalancing process. These efforts are intended to refine commercial workflows and further enhance Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing technology in preparation for broader deployment.

These Results mark a critical step in validating system compatibility across diverse battery chemistries and configurations, particularly in high-volume EV models nearing or beyond the end of their manufacturer warranties. Management believes the Results demonstrate both the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending rebalancing platform.

Read also: Challenges and Alternatives in President Trump’s Tariff Strategy

Various EOs are relevant to the propane industry. As global economics is a key market condition that will influence changes in the price of products like propane, commercial propane supplier DCC Propane, LLC, has analyzed the initial reaction to the announcements:

The EOs which will be felt by the propane industry

Of the dozens of EOs released by President Trump, those that will grab the attention of businesses tied to the propane industry and their consumers, in particular, include actions to:

Adjust the tariffs that affect the energy sector to increase the competitiveness seen within both domestic and international markets.

Declare an energy emergency in which high energy prices have been put under the spotlight.

Increase and streamline energy infrastructure and production domestically by simplifying permitting processes and reducing regulatory barriers.

Promote energy choice and appliance neutrality by introducing policies that aim to prevent favoritism toward a single energy source or appliance to create a level playing field in the market.

Reallocate federal grants that were previously only focused on electric vehicles to create more opportunities for the research and development of alternative energy initiatives.

How President Trump’s EOs could affect the propane market for the better

Another EO to note is President Trump’s signing establishing the National Energy Dominance Council. A fact sheet on the official White House site details how this move can be positive for the USA.

Detailed as a means for “positioning American energy for the next century,” this EO looks to develop American energy resources in a way that will allow the nation to rely less on foreign entities.

According to another section of the fact sheet, “American energy dominance is the most reliable way to ensure the stability and affordability of American energy prices.”

Recent history should provide some comfort for how President Trump can empower energy production in the USA. After all, during President Trump’s initial term in the White House, the country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in almost 70 years.

President Trump’s first term saw millions of acres of land across the USA opened up for the development of domestic energy, many new energy jobs created throughout the nation, and American families saving $2,500 on average per year on their gas and utility costs.

Speaking recently at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged that the USA’s abundant natural resources significantly outweigh the $36 trillion that the nation is in debt.

Mr. Burgum went on to claim that the country’s 10-year long-term interest rate would decrease if financial markets were given the opportunity to understand the value of the USA’s natural resources. He pointed out: “The interest rates right now are one of the most significant expenses we have as a country.

“So, one of the things that we have to do is unleash America’s balance sheet, and President Trump is helping us do that.”

Concerns in the propane industry about the EOs

There are some trepidations surrounding the introduction of these EOs though.

The National Propane Gas Association (NPGA), which is going to be working to make sure the EOs are implemented throughout each sector that the organization works in on behalf of the propane industry, had a pair of primary concerns.

As outlined by NPGA’s President and CEO Steve Kaminski and reported on by LP Gas Magazine, one of these concerns is the tariffs which will be placed on equipment and parts that arrive in the USA from across the globe to then be used by businesses in the propane industry.

“Steel tanks and cylinders manufactured outside of the United States and sold into the United States will get slapped with this 25 percent tariff. This is impacting a number of manufacturer members.”

Another concern of the NPGA is going to be the tariffs on propane that is coming into the USA from Canada. This is because the association lists annual cross-border propane sales from Canada into the USA to amount to $1.9 billion, but a ten percent tariff will work out at $190 million per year.

President Trump’s increase in tariffs on goods from China to 125 percent and Beijing’s imposing tariffs of 84 percent on US imports at the start of April have also led to speculation about how these moves may impact the US propane industry.

As reported on by Reuters, industry insiders have commented that Chinese petrochemical makers, which currently purchase $11 billion of US propane per year, look set to reduce output or shut for maintenance in the very near future because of tariffs on US imports driving up costs.

NPGA stated that it will monitor how President Trump and his administration approach tariffs. Though Kaminski did add: “This is one of our top priorities, but we also have a massive opportunity with this new administration, with the new appointees to the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation and EPA, which are all pro-energy choice, and with the new Congress.

“We have as good of an opportunity over the next several months as we’ve had in a long time to position propane very well in the future.”

Next steps for businesses and consumers

As propane has become one of the talking points following the announcement of President Trump’s EOs, Chris Daly, COO at DCC Propane, LLC, believes that businesses and consumers should investigate the benefits of using this gas without delay.

He advised: “Start by evaluating your energy needs. Switching to propane can assist with many business operations and provide heating solutions around facilities. Getting in touch with a propane supplier will also help you understand the cost-saving options of switching or expanding the use of propane.

“As domestic energy infrastructure and production is set to increase and be streamlined through President Trump’s EOs, make sure you are keeping up to date about any legislative changes and incentives that could be introduced across the nation which will affect the price and availability of propane.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PropaneShipped.jpg?fit=1000%2C666&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:28.982155

Climate change is even jacking up your grocery bill as farmers struggle to grow crops in fluctuating conditions.
Tallying Up the Bill: The most acute losses caused by climate change are typically related to storms and wildfires.
During former President Joe Biden’s term, it was upped to $190 per ton to reflect inflation and worsening climate change.
“Prioritizing policies like forest management and flood mitigation is far more impactful than obsessing over vague climate change goals.","The price of climate change is high—and the bill is only getting steeper as temperatures continue to rise, economists say.

A recent report compiled by risk management experts with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the University of Exeter in England found that the global economy could experience a 50 percent loss in gross domestic product between 2070 and 2090 due to climate change, based on current emissions trends.

But this isn’t just a far-off risk. Economic shocks from climate change are already rattling markets around the world.

In the U.S. alone, extreme weather costs roughly $150 billion each year from direct impacts such as damage to infrastructure, agricultural losses and widespread injuries, according to a 2023 federal assessment. The impacts of warming trickle down to a number of industries, from insurance to healthcare. Climate change is even jacking up your grocery bill as farmers struggle to grow crops in fluctuating conditions.

Despite mounting evidence of this staggering price tag, the Trump administration released a memo earlier in May directing federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when writing regulations, unless it is explicitly required by law. When countries don’t account for these economic costs, it has dangerous consequences for their citizens, warns André Corrêa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat who will head this year’s UN climate summit.

Tallying Up the Bill: The most acute losses caused by climate change are typically related to storms and wildfires.

Let’s take a look at the numbers: When Hurricane Helene hit the Southern U.S. last September, the damage was catastrophic. Severe flooding, landslides and their aftermath killed at least 250 people, damaged tens of thousands of homes in western North Carolina and hindered businesses across the region that rely on tourism dollars. Shortly after, Hurricane Milton hit Florida and tore through agricultural areas and buildings, including Tropicana Field, where the stadium’s fabric roof was ripped clean off by high winds.

Combined, the two storms caused an estimated $113 billion in direct damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The fires that burned through Los Angeles County early this year caused an estimated $250 billion in direct damages, one of the costliest weather-related disasters in U.S. history, The Los Angeles Times reports. In response to increasingly severe hurricanes and wildfires, insurance companies have jacked up premiums across the country for homeowners in recent decades, which I wrote about in April. Meanwhile, longer-term climate risks such as the spread of ticks and mosquitos, which carry illnesses such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus, have triggered a rise in costly medical visits, research shows.

As these impacts unfold, economists and actuaries are sounding the alarm. Since climate change pervades nearly every facet of society, it can be difficult to calculate warming’s exact economic impacts over the long term. But in recent years, financial experts have developed complex models and analyzed historical data to start adding up the bill.

The January report authored by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and University of Exeter found that the world is facing an increasing risk of “planetary insolvency,” when ecosystems become so degraded that they can no longer help prop up human society.

“You can’t have an economy without a society, and a society needs somewhere to live,” lead author Sandy Trust, former chair of the IFoA’s sustainability board, said in a press release. “Nature is our foundation, providing food, water and air, as well as the raw materials and energy that power our economy. Threats to the stability of this foundation are risks to future human prosperity which we must take action to avoid.”

Another key metric in climate economics is known as the social cost of carbon. This calculation measures the dollar cost of damages that ensue when one extra ton of carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. The Obama administration formally introduced this concept into U.S. regulatory policy, measuring the social cost of carbon at about $40 a ton.

So what does that look like in practice? One example is fuel efficiency standards. Though they can be costly to enact, the social cost of carbon analysis shows that the benefits to society outweighed the expense. That calculation was part of the rationale behind the Obama administration’s decision to finalize efficiency standards at 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025.

Shifting Policies: Not every president has the same approach when it comes to the social cost of carbon. During the first Trump administration, the social cost of carbon was dropped to less than $5 per ton. During former President Joe Biden’s term, it was upped to $190 per ton to reflect inflation and worsening climate change.

Now, the White House has ordered federal agencies to scrap the metric altogether, unless it is “plainly required” by law, according to a recent memo issued by Jeffrey B. Clark, the acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In the memo, Clark said too many uncertainties come with this metric, including “whether and to what degree any supposed changes in the climate are actually occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.”

A number of economists and environmental groups condemned the move and this rationale, which they say goes directly against the abundance of data that reflects the economic hits countries have taken in the face of global warming, E&E News reports. Ignoring the social cost of carbon in regulatory decisions could have major real-world consequences, David Cash, the former New England regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said in a recent interview with the public radio program Living on Earth.

“It would allow the [EPA], for example, to diminish the effectiveness of regulations so that cars could pollute more, factories could pollute more,” he said. “Gas plants and coal plants could produce more. All of which would increase the chance of greater storms, greater flooding, greater wildfires, greater drought, greater incidence of incredibly hot days in the summer where people will get more cases of asthma, more respiratory disease—all of those kinds of things. It will have a real world impact.”

I reached out to the White House to ask about the motivation behind this decision.

“For decades, the federal government has prioritized vague climate change goals over real disaster resilience and mitigation – policies that can prevent devastating tragedy during natural disasters,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in an emailed statement. “Prioritizing policies like forest management and flood mitigation is far more impactful than obsessing over vague climate change goals. The Trump administration is preventing short and long-term damage to families, communities, and our economy.”

Since Inauguration Day, the Trump administration has made cuts to programs that help support state efforts to protect homes and other buildings from extreme weather. That includes the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has helped cities and towns prepare for disasters through measures such as raising roads to protect against flooding, The Associated Press reports.

On the forest front, President Donald Trump issued an executive order in early March to increase domestic timber production, which my colleague Kiley Bense covered. Conservation groups warn that this move—which will expedite the permitting process—could increase wildfire risks and hurt ecosystems’ ability to absorb carbon emissions.

Meanwhile, NOAA announced earlier this month that it will no longer update a database that tracks the economic toll of climate-related weather events that cause billions of dollars in damages. A NOAA spokesperson told me that the decision was made in “alignment with evolving priorities and staffing changes.”

At times, Trump has argued that climate impacts could be positive for people in the U.S.

“The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years … and you’ll have more oceanfront property,” Trump said in an August discussion with Tesla owner Elon Musk. The Hill pointed out that sea levels are projected to rise between 10 to 12 inches over the next three decades, according to a 2022 federal report.

Other countries such as Australia and Russia have also failed to comprehensively incorporate climate change’s costs into national policies, environmental groups say.

Corrêa do Lago said in a recent interview with The Guardian that “economic denial” is the latest opposition strategy to climate action. He plans to make a push for governments to remodel the economy to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy, partially to avoid economic hits.

“Most of the answers have to come from the economy,” Corrêa do Lago told The Guardian. “Because we have now enough science, enough demonstration of how climate change can affect people’s lives. Now we need answers [in the form of policy measures]. We need economists to rally.”

On Wednesday, a large piece of rock and ice from a glacier collapsed in Switzerland, triggering a landslide that smothered most of a hillside village, Tammy Webber reports for The Associated Press. Scientists say the rock above the Birch Glacier had become unstable as permafrost on the mountain melted, making the formation too heavy to hold. The local government in this area had evacuated the village, located in the Valais region, earlier this month as a precaution, but authorities say that a man is still missing in the wake of the landslide.

The collapse occurred on the same day a regional civil court in Germany dismissed a Peruvian farmer’s claim that he and his community—threatened by melting glaciers—have been harmed by climate change driven by a German energy company’s emissions. But the court said German law does permit these types of claims.

A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Thursday could narrow the scope of environmental reviews required for major infrastructure projects such as pipelines and railways, my colleague Lisa Sorg reports. The case centered around a proposed 88-mile railway in Utah, which was approved by the Surface Transportation Board in 2021 after they conducted a review of its potential harms to the environment, a requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act. Environmental groups and a Colorado county sued the agency, claiming that their assessment did not consider all the risks to nearby ecosystems, such as oil spills and wildfires.

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion for five of the justices. (Three others signed on to a concurring opinion.) “Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line.”

Environmental groups such as Earthjustice and the Sierra Club are dismayed at the outcome and say it could open the door for more projects that hurt the environment and local communities.

Pharmaceutical company Moderna announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration canceled a $590 million federal contract to develop a bird flu vaccine for humans, Reuters reports. The contract was awarded by the Biden administration in January to prepare response efforts to the rapidly spreading, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza, which has transferred from animals to humans several times within the past year.

A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, headed by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told Reuters that the project had not met scientific standards or safety expectations.

Those two projects were worth a combined $102.4 million.
The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology.
It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.
Also eliminated was $270 million to Calpine subsidiary Sutter CCUS for another carbon capture project near Yuba City, California.","The Energy Department is canceling some $3.7 billion in government support for clean energy projects, including two in Ohio, that it said did not warrant continued backing from the Trump administration.

The agency said the move came after it found the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Ohio projects canceled were from Libbey Glass in Toledo and Owens-Brockway Glass Container in Zanesville. Those two projects were worth a combined $102.4 million. (The full list is below.)

Sixteen of the 24 projects were awarded during the Biden administration between Election Day and President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, the department said in a statement.

Among the canceled awards was $331 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. for a project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas at the company’s Baytown, Texas, Olefins Plant; $170 million to Kraft Heinz Co. for a series of clean energy projects; and $500 million to Heidelberg Materials AG for a low-carbon cement project, according to a list provided by the Energy Department.

The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology. Under an audit policy announced May 15, the department told beneficiaries of agency grants and support that they must quickly comply with requests for information or risk cancellation.

It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.

Under an internal plan to eliminate the agency, billions of dollars for hydrogen hubs would have been eliminated as well as carbon capture and battery storage projects. Also slated for termination was a direct air capture project by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. that had been selected for an award of as much as $1.2 billion by the Biden administration.

Other canceled awards announced Friday included $375 million to Eastman Chemical Co. for a molecular recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $270 million to a subsidiary of Calpine Corp. for work on a carbon capture project at Exxon’s Baytown facility. Also eliminated was $270 million to Calpine subsidiary Sutter CCUS for another carbon capture project near Yuba City, California.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the statement.",https://s3-prod.crainscleveland.com/styles/1200x630/s3/433914432.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 15:05:42.145519

Toyota Boshoku America (TBA) worked with Onyx Renewables to create the ground-mounted solar array on 17 acres adjacent to TBA’s manufacturing facility in Lawrenceville, Illinois. The manufacturing facility creates automotive interiors, particularly doors and seat assembly components, for the Toyota Highlander and Sequoia models.

The newly completed solar array is expected to fulfil 85% of electricity needs of the TBA Lawrenceville plant. Onyx Renewables is owner and operator of the solar farm, while Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy also participated in the collaborative effort.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables, in a statement. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

Nelnet Renewable Energy handled engineering, procurement and construction contractor duties on the Toyota Boshoku distributed energy project. The solar array could generate up to 9.5 million kWh of electricity in its first year, project developers say.

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, vice president of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Sol Systems originated and mobilized the on-site power project. Sol also will plant a pollinator-friendly habitat around the solar system.

Onyx worked with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources on choosing the types of plants and seeds for the habitat.

Toyota Boshoku America is hardly the first automobile industry firm to embrace on-site power. Sprocket Power completed microgrids at five New York dealerships with Honda, Toyota and GMC affiliations.

TBA employs more than 14,000 people in 23 manufacturing locations around the U.S.

“Based in part on initial public input, USACE determined that the proposed Project could

significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and that the Department of the Army permit decision is a major federal action requiring preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement,” read the released statement.

“The EIS identifies and assesses a reasonable range of alternatives, as well as the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental consequences of those alternatives, in order to identify options to avoid and minimize detrimental effects on the quality of the human environment.”

“The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan,” said Carrie Fox, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

“The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.”

The Environmental Impact Statement is meant to assess potential impacts of building a tunnel around Line 5 across the Straits, as well as potential impacts of project alternatives such as installing a layer of gravel over the existing pipeline.

The potential impacts being considered are to land use and recreation, aesthetics, water resources, biological resources, cultural resources, geology, soils, transporation and navigation, air quality, noise and vibration, socioeconomics, reliability and safety.

“In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” said Fox.

“The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.”

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” said Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff. “These processes will inform the District’s permit decision.”

This Draft Environmental Impact Statement has been released after years of talk and initial comments, a summary of which can be found in Appendix B of the DEIS, which is linked at the bottom of this article. Common themes of public comment include concerns about pipeline safety and spills, public health and safety and greenhouse gas emissions.

“Enbridge has a long history of accidents, spills, and inadequate cleanup,” reads one of the comment summaries under the topic heading of “Comments on the Applicant (Enbridge)” in the released Draft Environmental Impact Statement. “Degradation of their systems has gone unreported. Enbridge is responsible for the two largest inland oil spills in U.S. history, and has a long record of negligence, regulatory violations, and cover ups.

We thought they were scary because they didn’t make any noise. Those electric cars had a very small range and gradually disappeared by the mid 1930s.

Now, my daughter and her husband have two cars, one electric and one gasoline. The electric car is for local trips and the other for longer excursions. They have installed a level 2 charger in their garage.

A trip of 100 miles with the Bolt costs $3.07, a little less if charged at night.

The Spark, a gasoline powered Chevrolet with a similar body, costs $9.69 for the same trip, at 33 miles/gallon at $3.20/gallon. Using these present rates for electricity and gasoline, the electric vehicle reduces travel costs by 68%.

Furthermore, in five years there has been no maintenance or repair costs on the Bolt, while regular maintenance of the gas-powered car has been about $100/year. I conclude that electric cars are an excellent choice for commuting or other local uses; the limitation is the availability to high-speed charging stations in Montana.

Now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle, with a government incentive of up to $7,500 for a new electric car and up to $4,000 for a used one.

Ask Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Rep. Ryan Zinke to keep the EV credits in the reconciliation package so more people can drive electric and save money.

""This so-called 'big, beautiful bill' is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America's clean energy economy and a huge amount jobs across the country,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D- N.Y.

""If Republicans succeed in gutting these tax credits, it will mean higher monthly energy bills for families and small businesses, fewer jobs for hardworking Americans, and a dangerous step backward in innovation on energy.""

In April Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of N.C. and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., cautioning against the full-scale repeal of current green energy credits.

Municipal bond issuers and the public power industry have been tapping green energy credits and turning them into cash thanks to provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that allows non-profit organizations to access the elective pay program.

OBBBA also contains an increase of the SALT cap deduction to $40,000 for people making under $500,000 with annual 1% increases through 2033. The current limit is $10,000 and is set to expire at the end of the year with the rest of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Buying a car: Bottom line Even if the proposed car loan tax deduction becomes law, car buyers shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger financial picture.","Last year, data show Americans drove away from dealerships with more than 15 million new vehicles, with roughly 80% of buyers reportedly relying on financing to purchase. So far in 2025, average car prices are about $48,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, with interest rates for car loans hovering around an average of 8.64%.

For a 5-year loan, that roughly translates to $187 a month just in interest. For those who need a new car, those costs can strain budgets.

Now, a new proposal out of the U.S. House of Representatives would, if approved, ease that burden by allowing borrowers to deduct auto loan interest from their taxes. In its version of Trump’s One Big, Beautiful bill, the House GOP offers a tax deduction for car loan interest.

But while the plan sounds like it would provide savings, it’s important to note that not every car or buyer would qualify for the tax benefit. So, if you’re thinking about buying a new car, here’s what you need to know.

‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ car loan interest deduction proposed

Last week, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

That mega legislation, which now advances to the U.S. Senate for approval, is designed primarily to extend or make permanent tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

Here’s how the proposed auto loan interest deduction in the House GOP bill would work:

If passed, the measure would temporarily let car buyers write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans

The tax break would start with purchases made in 2025 and run through 2028.

You wouldn’t have to itemize to claim the deduction.

But not every buyer or vehicle would qualify for the tax break.

To qualify, the car must be assembled in the United States — a rule some industry manufacturers say would exclude many popular imports. (Think popular models from Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, and Toyota.)

The deduction would also start to phase out for individuals earning more than $100,000 or couples making over $200,000.

Higher-income households would see less benefit.

If the bill becomes law (the House passed its version of the legislation, but the Senate and the President must also approve the proposal), these changes would apply to loans taken out in 2025 and after, but just for three years, through 2028.

Who benefits from the auto loan deduction?

Supporters of the deduction argue it would provide direct financial relief to car buyers at a time when both vehicle prices and interest rates remain high.

Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), who introduced the Made in America Motors Act, which proposed a similar but lower tax break, called the deduction “a win for American taxpayers, auto workers, and Michigan.”

Huizenga noted in a statement that making car loan interest tax-deductible fulfills a Trump presidential campaign promise and “provides financial motivation for individuals and families to purchase American-made vehicles.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) sponsored a bill with a similar proposal, the USA CAR Act.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are finally ensuring every car sold in America is made in America and that working Americans can actually afford to buy a car in the first place. I’m proud to lead the way in the Senate,” Moreno said when introducing his bill.

Proponents also stress that, as mentioned, the deduction is structured as an above-the-line benefit, so taxpayers can claim it even if they claim the standard deduction on their federal returns.

Some advocates also see the measure as a way to incentivize buying U.S.-assembled vehicles.

Meanwhile, others question how much relief the deduction would actually provide and whether it is the most effective way to help car buyers.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at automotive services and technology provider Cox Automotive, and his team reportedly analyzed the proposed auto loan interest deduction. They found that if the average car owner pays $2,000 in interest over a year, they could save about $400 on their taxes under the House proposal.

However, given the overall costs of buying a car, Smoke told Bankrate the company doesn’t “think [the car loan tax deduction is] as exciting a proposition for driving more vehicle sales.”

There are also concerns about the deduction’s fairness and fiscal impact.

The benefit phases out for higher-income households, but some analysts argue that those with the means to buy new cars, especially more expensive models, are more likely to benefit.

On the other hand, many lower-income buyers and those purchasing used or imported vehicles could be left out.

And then there’s the cost: the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the provision would cost over $57 billion in lost federal revenue, raising questions about its broader economic trade-offs.

EV tax credit 2025?

It looks like electric vehicles could qualify for the proposed car loan interest deduction, provided they meet the same requirements as other vehicles under the House bill.

Also, the deduction doesn’t seem limited by vehicle type, so qualifying EVs and plug-in hybrids would likely be eligible if they are U.S.-assembled and the loan meets the bill’s other requirements.

But it’s worth noting that while the House GOP tax bill proposes a new tax break for U.S.-assembled vehicles, the legislation would end the up to $7,500 federal EV tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs after this year.

That is much earlier than the 2032 expiration initially set by the Inflation Reduction Act, passed during the Biden administration.

If the provision becomes law, only a small number of new EVs from manufacturers that haven't yet sold 200,000 qualifying vehicles would remain eligible for one additional year.

In addition to ending these credits, the bill would introduce new annual fees: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

Remember: The Senate will likely make changes to the House version of the legislation, but if these EV provisions become law, they would increase the cost of ownership for those vehicles.

What about auto tariffs under Trump?

Data show that Trump’s auto tariffs introduced in 2025 are already driving up car prices across the U.S.

The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts has reportedly pushed the price of an average new vehicle up by 2.5% in April.

That’s more than double the typical monthly increase for this time of year, according to Cox Automotive and Kelley Blue Book analyses.

True Car reports that some foreign models have seen increases of $5,000 to $10,000. Global supply chains also affect domestically produced automobiles, some facing added costs of about $2,000 to $3,000.

Note: When it comes to the proposed car loan interest deduction, most imported vehicles, subject to the new 25% tariff, wouldn’t meet this U.S. assembly requirement and would not be eligible for it.

However, some U.S.-assembled vehicles may still include imported parts affected by tariffs. As a result, higher parts costs from tariffs could still push up prices for some qualifying models.

Buying a car: Bottom line

Even if the proposed car loan tax deduction becomes law, car buyers shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger financial picture.

The price of the car, interest rates, insurance, upkeep, and any new fees all add up quickly. It’s also important to keep tabs on your credit score, since that can make a big difference in what you pay over the life of your loan.

Recent tariffs could also play a role: a 25% tariff on most auto parts could push prices even higher, even for models assembled in the U.S. Though two court rulings issued in late May, have at least temporarily halted some of Trump's tariffs.

No matter what tax breaks could be on the table, it’s worth taking the time to run the numbers, shop around for the best financing, and make sure your car purchase truly fits your needs and budget.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ev-tax-credit-elimination-what-could-mean-tesla-us-auto-industry-ends

The reconciliation bill working its way through Congress would eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit created under the Inflation Reduction Act. The removal of the credit, created to incentivize U.S. consumers to purchase electrified vehicles, would likely lead to a drop in EV sales and production. However, Tesla sales would likely remain largely unaffected, one expert predicts.

""Getting rid of this $7,500 tax credit should not impact [Tesla] sales,"" automotive expert Lauren Fix told FOX Business. ""People buy Teslas because they like the product… They know what their customers want, and those that like Teslas will continue to purchase that product.""

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" was approved by the House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote. If the measure passes the Senate and is signed into law by President Donald Trump, the $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and $4,000 used-vehicle tax credit incentives on EVs would be killed, along with subsidies for battery manufacturing, the text of the bill says. The EV tax credit, which started during the Obama administration, is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The new provision ""accelerates the expiration to December 31, 2025.""

Ending the clean vehicle tax credit would result in a sharp decrease in EV sales in the U.S., Fix said.

""Once that tax credit goes away, I'm expecting [electric vehicles] to be about 2% of sales,"" Fix said, noting that EVs currently account for around 8% of total car sales in the U.S. ""There will still be electric vehicle sales, Tesla will still survive and [Elon Musk] will do well. And other brands will make what consumers want.""

Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer in the U.S., has focused more on selling carbon credits to other automakers than it has on consumer tax incentives. The company, which has moved the bulk of its production to Texas, has also become ""more efficient and effective"" in its manufacturing, according to Fix.

""What Tesla has done, and they don't really care about the $7,500 tax credit, is they were selling carbon credits to all the other car manufacturers,"" Fix said. ""That's where they've made their profits.""

Meanwhile, other leading EV automakers like Hyundai and Ford may decide to reduce production of electrified vehicles if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is signed into law, she said.

""You're going to see their production quantities drop dramatically,"" Fix said. ""The only reason the manufacturers are building electric vehicles to begin with is because they were mandated to do so.""

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization (Lander County): The project will expand three existing power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15-MW solar PV field—potentially increasing output beyond the current 193-MW capacity.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio): Exploration and test drilling on public lands to evaluate geothermal energy potential.

BLM To Complete Reviews in 14 Days

Under the new process, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will complete environmental assessments in just 14 days—a sharp drop from the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.

The expedited permitting reviews apply to a broad range of traditional energy developments, including oil and natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal energy, kinetic hydropower, and critical minerals.

Ormat’s Journey

Ormat was established in 1965 by Lucien Y. Bronicki and his wife, Dita, according to the company’s website. Building upon Bronicki’s patents and research performed at the National Laboratory, the aim was to continue the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of a small solar turbine following the discontinuation of the project in the laboratory due to budget constraints. In 1966, Ormat’s first 600-W solar-powered Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit, which drove an electric water pump, was installed in Mali.

Fast forward to the 1980s when Ormat transitioned from a supplier of power equipment to a power plant turnkey provider, which expanded to owner and operator of geothermal plants, including exploration, development, and operation of geothermal fields. In 1984, the Wubaska (Nevada) 700-KW ORC geothermal power plant was the first commercial ORC in operation in the US. In 1986, the 30-MW Ormesa 1 (geothermal power plant in Holtville, California) was put in operation, according to Ormat.

In 2011, the US Department of Energy issued a $350 million partial loan guarantee under the Financial Institution Partnership Program to finance Ormat's three geothermal power plants across northern Nevada.

Last year, Ormat and SLB agreed to a strategic collaboration to develop and deliver integrated geothermal projects. SLB said in a press release that it has been involved in 80% of the world’s geothermal power projects. Combined with Ormat being the largest manufacturer of geothermal binary equipment and the largest owner and operator of geothermal fields and power plants under management, the companies see benefits to be gained by their complementary strengths.

Earlier this month, a subsidiary of Ormat Technologies signed an agreement to acquire the 20-MW Blue Mountain Geothermal Project in Nevada from Cyrq Energy LLC for $88 million. Closing is expected at the end of June, Ormat said in its Q1 2025 presentation. The plant was originally built by Ormat in 2009. Planned upgrades include 3.5 MW additional capacity by 2027 and 13 MW of solar PV for the geothermal auxiliary.",https://assets.spe.org/dims4/default/202a71d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+136/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fspe-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F30%2F1e9130cb499b80ae60676cf73b8b%2Format-geothermal-mcginness-hills-complex.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 05:01:02.269365

“I think the toothpaste is out of the proverbial tube.” EV Updates Greenfield said electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to increase.
According to BloombergNEF, global passenger EV sales are forecast to rise 30% to 22 million in 2025.
He provided data from Cox Automotive focusing on the market share of U.S. car and truck sales by vehicle type.
Repair and Service Implications In terms of repair and service implications, Greenfield noted that franchise dealers have been consistently losing market share for vehicle maintenance.","During the Equipment and Tool Institute (ETI) ToolTech conference in April, an automotive industry update was provided by Steve Greenfield, general partner at Automotive Ventures and author of “The Future of Mobility,” “The Future of Automotive Retail” and the weekly “Intel Report.”

Greenfield pointed to the current migration toward purchasing larger vehicles, pickup trucks and SUVs. As an example, the top three selling light vehicles in 2024 were the Ford F-Series (765,649), the Chevrolet Silverado (549,945) and the Toyota RAV4 (475,193).

Looking back to the mid-1970s, Greenfield noted that sedans and wagons were the dominant cars on the road. Fast forward to today, and many U.S. vehicles are similar in weight, although their miles per gallon and horsepower have doubled.

“With lightweighting technologies, we've been able to bring the weight equal to what the weight was back in 1975 and found a lot more efficiencies with drivetrains,” he explained. “That’s why we’ve had this creeping up in size and weight.”

As a result, he said automobiles have never been heavier, more powerful, less polluting or more efficient.

He also shared the reason why many prefer to have their loved ones in heavier cars.

“The fatality rate is roughly seven times higher when colliding with a heavy pickup truck than with a compact car,” he shared. “As the weight of your car increases, the risk of killing others increases dramatically.”

Greenfield forecasted the trend will continue. “It’s an interesting philosophical argument to say, ‘How do we convince the American consumer to go back to smaller and lighter-weight vehicles?” he said. “I think the toothpaste is out of the proverbial tube.”

EV Updates

Greenfield said electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to increase. According to BloombergNEF, global passenger EV sales are forecast to rise 30% to 22 million in 2025.

“However, the rate of change is coming down,” said Greenfield. “In the U.S. especially, we've topped out on battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We're hovering around 8% to 9%, even with the tax incentives, which haven't yet been repealed but are likely to get repealed at some point.”

Currently, China has the largest share of EV sales, while Western countries, including the U.S., have slowed down.

With EVs losing ground, Greenfield said hybrid sales are rising, which will have implications on repairability. He provided data from Cox Automotive focusing on the market share of U.S. car and truck sales by vehicle type. EV sales have softened and are currently at 6.2%. Non-plug-in hybrids make up 8.5% and plug-in hybrids account for 2.3%.

BloombergNEF expects slow growth in EV market share this year in the U.S., followed by an acceleration in the years to come.

Greenfield said EV growth would likely be dependent on advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries and inductive (wireless) charging, which provide faster charging, improved safety and better range.

He forecasts that, ultimately, EVs will be the dominant drivetrain. However, in the interim, especially if the tax credits get repealed, he said, “We've got a world of hurt and a lot of noise between now and that vision in the future.”

In the meantime, he said, “balancing this is very, very hard for legacy automakers,” which are evaluating when to build battery plants and anticipating when consumers will be ready to purchase EVs.

He used the example of Ford’s lack of profitability in EVs.

“All this noise about consumer adoption means that Ford believes there will be a future where EVs are dominant, but in the meantime, they're eating a lot of losses with their business.”

He said it would be easy to say, “Stop building EVs. We're going to go all in on ICE.” However, that would be shortsighted if automakers believe that batteries will be the dominant drivetrain in the future.

Implications of U.S. Tariffs

Greenfield also discussed the impact of tariffs on car purchases. From the conversations he has had with dealerships, Greenfield has found they are experiencing strong sales.

“If I give you any hint today, buy a car soon because when these tariffs hit, you're going to see a massive increase in MSRP and the used car market will react almost immediately like it did during COVID,” said Greenfield.

As a result, he said consumers will face higher prices and likely slow down purchasing due to shell shock. This dynamic, according to Greenfield, will not be beneficial for inflation or consumers.

China Perspective

After two centuries of the West leading five successive technological waves — the Industrial Revolution, the Age of Steam & Rail, the Age of Steel & Electricity, the Age of Oil & Mass production and the Information Age — Greenfield said that China is poised to lead the world into the sixth major technology revolution: the Renewable Age.

Data from BloombergNEF illustrates that China dominates the battery value chain, with 95% of all battery technology. In addition, Chinese car production shares have risen from 1% to 39% over the past 20 years, according to Bloomberg/BofA Global Research.

Greenfield said China’s car production capacity has risen faster than sales due to lower production costs.

“China now comprises 40% of all vehicles built,” he said.

With approximately 150 Chinese automakers, Greenfield said the country is experiencing overproduction.

“The Chinese are pushing very aggressively to export cars elsewhere,” he explained.

However, he said the dynamics are unsustainable and forecasted there will be fewer automakers and franchise dealers, as well as less capacity, as a result.

“I think you are going to see more pressure on the legacy automakers, for lack of any other strategy, to consolidate,” Greenfield predicted.

Repair and Service Implications

In terms of repair and service implications, Greenfield noted that franchise dealers have been consistently losing market share for vehicle maintenance. In the 1960s, they had about 45% market share, according to a study by Cox Automotive Maintenance and Repair. Today, that percentage has fallen to about 30% of consumers who use franchise dealers to service their vehicles.

Greenfield attributes this to the reduced number of components in EVs. An ICE vehicle, for example, has about 2,000 moving parts, whereas an EV has 20.

“The fewer the parts, the less frequent service,” Greenfield acknowledged.

Greenfield said the rise in hybrids provides more opportunities for repair and service centers due to the vehicles’ two drivetrains.

“You're going to need the service intervals for the battery, but you're also going to need the service intervals for the ICE engine,” he noted.

With hybrids, there are more chances for components to fail, additional maintenance and potential recalls, which provide the opportunity to see consumers more frequently.

“I think franchisors should be feeling pretty confident now as opposed to a few years ago,” said Greenfield.

With vehicles becoming more complex, Greenfield acknowledged it will be challenging for technicians to keep up with the various OEM certification programs and specifications. In addition to new skill sets that will be needed, there will be specific tools and equipment required by automakers.

He forecasted a movement toward a national Right to Repair Act that would enable independent repair shops to obtain the schematics and telematics data needed.

Looking ahead, Greenfield predicted OEMs will do everything within their power to drive loyalty back to franchise dealers.

Greenfield cited data from Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing the cost of vehicle repairs has increased by almost 50% since the start of the pandemic, far exceeding regular inflation.

“We had supply chain issues all of us lived through. You couldn't get parts. You couldn't get technicians to show up,” he recalled. “As a result, all of that meant very much higher cost to repair vehicles overall.”

He predicts this will continue.

Greenfield also provided a comparison of EV vs. ICE construction based on information from Mitchell.

“EVs are comprised of a higher percentage of lighter-weight materials such as aluminum, carbon fiber and composites,” he explained. “These substrates respond differently than mild steel after an accident and are much more likely to require replacement than mild steel major component parts.”

The average number of replacement parts per estimate has grown by more than 15% since 2019 in the U.S. and Canada, according to Mitchell data. Replacement parts account for more than 51% of the overall repair cost.

As a result of these changes, Greenfield said the average repair bill for a vehicle after an accident will increase severity. Higher repairability costs will also likely manifest in higher insurance premiums.

“There has to be a reconciliation at some point,” said Greenfield. “I don't really hear ever that consumers are pushing back around buying a car because of the insurance premiums in the car, but maybe that's going to be more of a topic of conversation going forward.”",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/Nov_24/Steve_Greenfield_web_full.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 07:05:06.256112

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act. This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “waiver” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30% of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3% of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2% of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things, either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA.

Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House — the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans — to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a senator in the majority and as a senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

Dive Brief:

Eight of the top 10 states for utility-scale clean energy deployment in the first quarter of 2025 voted Republican in last year’s Presidential election, the American Clean Power Association said on Thursday.

Texas was the runaway leader with more than 1,700 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage deployments and a 20% year-over-year increase in total clean energy capacity. Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Wyoming rounded out the top five, ACP said.

The 7.4 gigawatts of new clean power capacity in the U.S. was the second-strongest Q1 on record. Energy storage was the fastest-growing segment, with nationwide battery storage capacity increasing 65% year over year.

Dive Insight:

Total utility-scale clean energy deployments in the first quarter of this year came in 9% shy of the record-setting first quarter of 2024, when developers commissioned 8,089 MW of wind, solar and storage capacity, ACP said.

ACP’s data reflects the increasingly broad geography of utility-scale solar and storage deployments. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity, adding 435 MW, while Illinois, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Ohio all deployed far more solar than California. Total U.S. clean energy capacity sits at about 320.9 GW — of which, 80.7 GW is in Texas, ACP said.

The clean power development pipeline expanded as well, growing 12% year over year to reach about 184.4 GW and an estimated $328 billion in completed value. But that marks a slowdown from a year ago, when fully permitted clean power capacity under construction or in advanced development rose 26% from Q1 2023.

Developers have canceled more than $14 billion in clean energy projects so far this year amid uncertainty over the future of federal tax credits for clean energy investment, production and manufacturing, according to the consulting group E2.

ACP’s latest report hinted at the scale of the potential risk to state and local economies if the House GOP’s proposed rapid wind-down of energy tax credits remains in the final budget reconciliation bill that now sits before the Senate.

Domestic manufacturing and energy production investments now generate $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and landowner payments in rural communities and have created nearly 650,000 jobs, ACP said.

“We have the technology, investment capital and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline,” Grumet said, describing those projects as shovel-ready. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Utilities and independent power producers across the South, Midwest and West have proposed dozens of gigawatts of new gas-fired generation projects since 2023, including an up to 4.5-GW project in western Pennsylvania that could begin operations next year and eventually become the United States’ largest gas power plant.

Clarios is in talks with officials from Indiana, Texas, and Utah about possible locations, the release said. The project is the first under the company’s $6 billion U.S. energy manufacturing plan, which includes $1.9 billion for critical minerals processing and recovery.

“We have a number of other investments we're actively exploring and anticipate additional announcements in the future,” Adam Muellerweiss, Clarios chief sustainability officer, said in an email to Supply Chain Dive.

The planned facility would extract metalloid antimony from used batteries collected across the U.S. to bolster domestic battery production, Muellerweiss said at the Securing American Battery Technologies Summit, held the same day as the plant announcement.

In December, China banned the export of antimony and other critical minerals used in military and civilian applications to the U.S. That action significantly raised the need for Clarios’ recycling plant, Muellerweiss said, noting that recycled batteries ""have the most antimony of any source here in the United States.”

In an email, Muellerweiss said actions taken by Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have made it possible for Clarios to invest in bolstering the nation’s critical mineral supply.

Since January, Trump has issued nine executive orders that affected critical mineral processing, refining and deployment, Muellerweiss said. In 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which established the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. The AMPTC is also known as the 45x tax credit.

Why are Republicans ostracizing renewable energy and biting their noses to spite their faces?","It has become obvious that the Trump administration as well as Republicans in Ohio and West Virginia no longer believe their own mantra “all of the above” when it comes to energy sources. Instead, this administration has put a halt to as many renewable energy projects as possible and is now taking us back to the good ole’ days where fossil fuels were our only choice.

West Virginia politicians and the Trump administration want to revive the coal industry while ignoring the negative environmental and health impacts, the costs, and the fact that the average age of coal plants is over 50 years. Coal states like West Virginia are getting help from Trump in the form of several executive orders. The first, Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid executive order (EO), permits the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to favor fossil energy over renewable energy and to use its emergency powers under Section 202 of the Federal Power Act to prop up old, uneconomic coal-burning power plants “even if there are cheaper alternatives that could replace them.”

The second EO, Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry, will permit the expansion of coal leasing on federal lands and offer loans as well as expedite permitting. The third directive, Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Energy, will exempt coal plants from complying with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) updated Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Research shows that local communities have had to pay $236 billion in overall added health costs between 2015 and 2023 attributed to coal mining and coal power plants.

The fourth EO, Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, “directs the U.S. Department of Justice to harass state and local governments by challenging climate, climate justice, and energy laws and policies.” Coal mining and coal power plants contribute to climate changing gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Coal extraction also creates coal-ash dumps; West Virginia has 48. They “contain hazardous pollutants including arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, mercury, molybdenum, radium, selenium, and other heavy metals. These are linked to cancer, heart and thyroid disease, reproductive failure, and neurological harm.”

Ohio, citing the need for more energy to power AI, cryptocurrency, and other technologies, wants to expand fracked methane gas production across the state. John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy said of this methane gas buildout, “we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period.”

Renewable energy like wind has been touted as being clean, cheap and reliable, but the Trump administration “directed agencies to stop all permits for wind farms pending federal review.”

West Virginia is also pushing back on wind energy as Sen. Chris Rose introduced SB 439 which would repeal WV law §11-6A-5a. This law allows wind turbine projects to be taxed at a lower level because they are classified as “pollution control facilities.” Sen. Joey Garcia said of SB 439, “It’s kind of a slap and an affront to those businesses in West Virginia, including those energy businesses that want to bring new investments to the state of West Virginia.”

Ohio has some of the most stringent set-back laws in the USA for wind turbines; 1125 feet from the blade tip to boundary line. However, fracking well pads can be located within 150 feet of a property boundary. Ohio’s SB 52 “grants county commissioners the power to designate areas where wind and solar development can be restricted or prohibited.” But, private land can be taken for fracking using “mandatory pooling laws.”

“There are more than 100,000 acres of former mine lands and other brownfields in West Virginia that could be suitable for solar development.” West Virginia had plans to build solar arrays in these types of areas where extractive industries were once located. But, West Virginians still aren’t able to subscribe to community solar programs in the state, and HB 2568, introduced in February this year, will do away with net metering for public utilities. This is a process which allows citizens with solar panels to sell excess energy back to the grid.

Using SB 52, Ohio counties have stopped several solar projects which would have provided substantial benefits to the communities as well as cheap power for the grid. Recently, Open Road Renewables’ Grange Solar Grazing Center in Logan County withdrew its application for a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need from the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB). It would have provided thousands of dollars in taxes to the local community along with starting a local sheep grazing industry.

Local opposition stoked by dark money groups and “anti-solar propaganda” were cited as some of the reasons the project (which was an agrivoltaics project) was abandoned. Some claim solar panels are toxic. To address these claims the Ohio Department of Health did a study in 2022 on the safety of solar energy which included: solar materials (Silicon and Tellurium), disposal and storage, heat, noise, electromagnetic fields, and battery storage. For all categories, no public health burden was found, unlike health studies performed for gas fracking by the Physicians for Social Responsibility which found multiple health issues with the process.

“According to Lazard’s 2023 analysis of unsubsidized Levelized Cost of Electricity in the U.S., both onshore wind and utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies are more cost-effective than combined cycle natural gas power plants” and in 2024, solar and wind provided 17 percent of USA electricity, exceeding coal’s 15 percent. Why are Republicans ostracizing renewable energy and biting their noses to spite their faces?

In a new research note, the analyst highlighted a year of “divergence” and “a bifurcated global EV industry,” noting “distinct implications for OEMs, suppliers, energy players and investors.”

“While China’s EV market pushes ahead with scale and innovation, the West is slowing, facing demand headwinds, policy uncertainty, and rising costs,” the analyst said.

Regarding EV penetration in the United States, Roeska stated that, year to date, “9.9% of new car sales in the U.S. have been EVs,” up from 9.6% in the same period last year.

The analyst noted, however, that the rate of growth was slower from 2024 to 2025, when compared to the “2.9% of growth seen from 2023 to 2024.”

“However, despite a period of slower growth, we forecast EV sales growth to continue,” the analyst stated.

By 2030, the firm expects that 25% of new car sales will be battery electric vehicles (BEV), and 11% will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV).

In so doing, the Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court’s ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado (Seven County), finding that the Board erred in failing to consider potential upstream and downstream environmental effects of a proposed rail line in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The decision marks a notable shift in the scope of NEPA obligations, particularly in contrast to the D.C. Circuit’s earlier reliance on Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations and Sierra Club v. FERC (Sabal Trail), which held that an agency conducting NEPA review must consider greenhouse gas emissions that may occur downstream of an authorized project if those emissions are “reasonably foreseeable” when such emissions are an indirect environmental effect of the approval.

In Seven County, a group of Utah counties applied to the Board for approval of an 88-mile railroad line to facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in other states. The Board prepared an EIS and, based on the conclusion that the project’s transportation and economic benefits outweighed its environmental effects, approved the railroad line. Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups challenged the EIS in the D.C. Circuit arguing that the EIS should have considered the environmental impacts from upstream oil drilling in the Uinta Basin and downstream oil refining projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Relying on Sabal Trail, the D.C. Circuit agreed and found that the Board had wrongfully limited its analysis of the environmental effects of the railroad line project. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit’s findings.

NEPA Is a Procedural Cross Check and Not a Substantive Roadblock to Agency Decision-Making

Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, characterized NEPA a “procedural crosscheck and not a substantive roadblock.” The Court was highly critical of litigants using NEPA to delay or block infrastructure projects based on downstream environmental effects over which a permitting agency had no legal authority. It stated that as long as an EIS addresses environmental effects of the project at hand, courts should defer to the lead agency’s decision regarding the scope of review. This includes in the extent to consider its indirect environmental impacts, and whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects that were separate in time or place, or subject to a different regulatory scheme. It repeatedly emphasized its holding in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, a 2004 decision finding that an agency’s NEPA analysis need not consider effects for which it is not the proximate cause. In other words, simply because “the effects from a separate project may be factually foreseeable,” this “does not mean that those effects are relevant to the agency’s decision-making process or that it is reasonable to hold the agency responsible for those effects.”

The Court espoused a “rule of reason,” noting that courts should not substitute their judgement for that of the agency. Finally, the Court found that the D.C. Circuit erroneously had required the Board to consider environmental impacts of projects that were separate in time and place from the rail project that the counties were proposing to construct, were outside the Board’s jurisdiction and if they were to move forward in the future would be undertaken by third parties.

In a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Sotomayor (joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson) agreed that the D.C. Circuit had required too much of the Board under NEPA. But they reached that conclusion simply because the Board indisputably lacked authority to deny approval of the railroad line based on the environmental concerns at issue.

Potential Impacts of Decision

Seven County is the latest action to restrict project opponents’ use of the NEPA process to defeat infrastructure projects. Indeed, the opinion observes that NEPA challenges not only prevent projects from crossing the “finish line,” but discourages some from approaching the “starting line.” The Court’s interpretation of NEPA, and its differentiation between effects that are factually foreseeable versus legally relevant, is at odds with the NEPA regulations implemented last year under President Biden, which had emphasized consideration of downstream impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, as explained by Akin in an earlier alert. While CEQ used an interim final rule to remove those regulations in February of this year, the Seven County decision is likely to blunt future challenges to the NEPA regulatory scheme, as we anticipate changes will be made in response to forthcoming CEQ guidance and congressional NEPA reform efforts. The decision also follows a November 2024 D.C. Circuit decision, Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration (Marin Audubon), that held CEQ lacked statutory authority to issue any regulations, further weakening the NEPA regulatory scheme.

The Court’s focus on agency deference and clarification that agencies are not required to consider upstream and downstream impacts of a project may further expedite NEPA reviews and streamline permitting by lessening the types of legal challenges to agency decision-making. The Court also emphasized the importance of clarity and predictability in cases involving the American economy, which may signal a shift to jurisprudence that champions economic opportunities over environmental considerations. It remains to be seen how this may impact ongoing debates in Congress on permitting reform and changes to the NEPA statute, including how it may affect discussions underway regarding a potential provision that would allow project sponsors to pay for expedited NEPA review in favor of agency deference.",https://www.akingump.com/a/web/6TJqJKWbi7h1tpz46Eani/aqjviA/mind-over-matter-executive-order-seeks-to-reframe-regulatory-crime.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 02:01:00.447215

Associated Press

More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump‘s pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

Despite that ban, the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) launched a new agriPV tender to boost project development in April this year.
Additionally, MASE issued the “suitable areas” decree in June 2024, outlining guidelines for identifying land appropriate for ground-mounted renewable energy installations.
In its ruling, the Regional Administrative Court in Lazio also questioned the constitutionality of the DL Agricoltura, which banned ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land.
Furthermore, Italy saw a 16% year-on-year drop in new solar PV installations in Q1 2025, adding 1.4GW, according to trade association Italia Solare.","Covering an area of about 100 hectares, the project combines power generation and agriculture. Crops will include olives trees, aromatic herbs and cultivars like garlic, celery, parsley, several types of salad, spinach and legumins.

“This is our first project to have reached the construction phase in Italy,” said Alberto Arcioli, head of development at Aquila Clean Energy Italy.

This news comes against the backdrop of the Italian government introducing a nationwide ban on ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land last year. In May 2024, the government announced the ban in a bid to protect farmland and curb what officials described as unchecked solar development.

Despite that ban, the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) launched a new agriPV tender to boost project development in April this year. Managed by the national energy agency Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), the tender would distribute €323 million (US$349 million) to support agriPV initiatives.

Additionally, MASE issued the “suitable areas” decree in June 2024, outlining guidelines for identifying land appropriate for ground-mounted renewable energy installations. The decree granted regional authorities the power to establish their own regulations, however, the decree was partially annulled by an Italian court earlier this month. In its ruling, the Regional Administrative Court in Lazio also questioned the constitutionality of the DL Agricoltura, which banned ground-mounted solar PV installations on agricultural land.

Furthermore, Italy saw a 16% year-on-year drop in new solar PV installations in Q1 2025, adding 1.4GW, according to trade association Italia Solare. Utility-scale projects contributed nearly half of this with 684MW – up from 553MW in Q1 2024 – indicating a rise in average project size.

The country’s total installed solar capacity stands at 38.5GW at the end of March 2025, with the commercial and industrial segment leading at 17.5GW (45%), followed by residential at 10.7GW (28%) and utility-scale at 10.3GW (27%).",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Planta-Solar-FV-Aquila-Clean-Energy-Jaen-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:20:16.949100

Wind and solar capacity in California increased from 9.7 GW in 2014 to 28.2 GW by the end of 2024, EIA said. California curtails solar and wind generation to keep the grid stable and to leave room for natural gas generation, in order to comply with North American Electric Reliability Corp. requirements and “have generation online in time to ramp up in the evening hours,” according to the report.

CAISO is responding to increased curtailments by “trading with neighboring balancing authorities to try to sell excess solar and wind power, incorporating battery storage into ancillary services, energy, and capacity markets, and including curtailment reduction in transmission planning,” according to EIA.

Later this year, companies in the state are also planning to start using excess renewable energy to “make hydrogen, some of which will be stored and mixed with natural gas for summer generation at the Intermountain Power Project’s new facility scheduled to come online in July,” the report said.

One of those companies, SoHyCal, said that once it begins using solar energy for this purpose, it “[expects] to produce a total of three tons per day of green hydrogen powered by PV by Q2 of 2025. This amount of hydrogen will fuel up to 210,000 cars per year or 30,000 city buses.”

In Georgetown, Kentucky—Toyota’s biggest plant globally—the upcoming electric vehicle will join an existing lineup that includes the hybrid-only Camry, the RAV4 (soon dropping its gas-only version), and the Lexus ES.

In Princeton, Indiana, Toyota will produce another all-electric model alongside larger vehicles like the Sienna, Highlander, and Grand Highlander. The company hasn’t yet disclosed what that new EV will be.

How many electric vehicles will Toyota offer by 2027?

The backstory:

Toyota currently sells two all-electric models in the U.S.: the bZ4X, which will be renamed simply ""bZ,"" and the Lexus RZ. By mid-2027, five more will join the lineup:

Two new EVs built in the U.S.

Three imported EVs: the bZ Woodland, a new all-electric CH-R crossover, and an EV version of the Lexus ES.

That expansion reflects a growing, though still measured, embrace of full electrification. In 2024, EVs made up just 8% of U.S. auto sales, and Toyota sold fewer than 30,000 fully electric vehicles domestically.

How is Toyota powering this EV push?

A key driver of the strategy is Toyota’s new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina. The massive facility spans 1,850 acres and will begin shipping lithium-ion cells later this year.

Ten of its 14 production lines will serve electric vehicles, with the rest focused on hybrids. At full capacity, it will support 30 gigawatt-hours of annual output—enough for:

300,000 fully electric vehicles

150,000 plug-in hybrids

800,000 traditional hybrid vehicles

The first hybrid battery line is set to go online next month, with the rest rolling out through 2034.

Why is Toyota still hesitant about EV demand?

The other side:

Despite its expanded EV roadmap, Toyota remains cautious. Executives are wary of weak U.S. demand, especially compared to markets like China and Europe. To safeguard production targets, Toyota will rely heavily on exports—only committing to full-scale production once a vehicle is expected to move 100,000 to 150,000 units annually.

However, that plan could face new headwinds. President Trump’s proposed tariffs could trigger trade tensions and disrupt Toyota’s global export strategies, which are key to absorbing any U.S. oversupply.

What they're saying:

Toyota officials have repeatedly emphasized their preference for letting the market—not mandates—dictate EV adoption. While some automakers are going all-in on battery electric vehicles, Toyota continues to highlight the role of hybrids and the need for flexible, diversified strategies.

Executives have argued that hybrids remain a more affordable and scalable solution for many consumers, especially amid high EV sticker prices and limited charging infrastructure in parts of the U.S.

Why you should care:

Toyota’s pivot could reshape the American EV landscape. As one of the world’s most influential automakers, its decisions carry weight.

To date, E2 has tracked 390 major clean energy projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022.","More than $14 billion in US renewable and EV investments and 10,000 new jobs have been scrapped or put on hold since January, according to a new analysis from E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. The reason: growing fears that the Republican-majority Congress will pull the plug on federal clean energy tax credits.

In April alone, companies backed out of $4.5 billion in battery, EV, and wind projects right before the House passed a sweeping tax and spending bill that would gut the federal tax incentives fueling the clean energy boom. E2 also found another $1.5 billion in previously unreported project cancellations from earlier in the year.

Now, with the Senate preparing to take up the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” E2 says over 10,000 clean energy jobs have already vanished.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Ironically, it’s Republican-led congressional districts – the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 – that are feeling the most pain. So far, more than $12 billion in investments and over 13,000 jobs have been canceled in GOP districts.

Through April, 61% of all clean energy projects, 72% of jobs, and 82% of investments have been in Republican districts.

Despite the rising number of cancellations, some companies are still forging ahead. In April, businesses announced nearly $500 million in new clean energy investments across six states. That includes a $400 million expansion by Corning in Michigan to make solar wafers, which is expected to create at least 400 jobs, and a $9.3 million investment from a Canadian solar equipment company in North Carolina.

If completed, the seven projects announced last month could create nearly 3,000 permanent jobs.

To date, E2 has tracked 390 major clean energy projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022. In total, companies plan to invest $132 billion and hire 123,000 permanent workers.

But the report warns that momentum could grind to a halt if the House tax plan becomes law. Since the clean energy tax credits were signed into law, 45 announced projects have been canceled, downsized, or closed entirely, wiping out nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments.

What’s more, Trump’s Department of Energy announced today that it was killing more than $3.7 billion in funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. Eighteen out of 24 projects were awarded through DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which was made law in the Inflation Reduction Act. It aimed to strengthen the economic competitiveness of US manufacturers in global markets demanding lower carbon emissions, while supporting US manufacturing jobs and communities.

Executive Director Jason Walsh of the BlueGreen Alliance said in a statement in response to today’s DOE announcement:

The awarded projects that DOE is seeking to kill are concentrated in rural areas and red states. American manufacturers are hungry to partner with the federal government to bolster US industry. The IDP saw $60 billion worth of applications during the program selection process, a ten-times oversubscription.

President Trump claims to be a champion of American manufacturing, but today’s announcement is further evidence that he and his Secretary of Energy are liars.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said.

All submitted comments are included in the Detroit District’s administrative record, analyzed, and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS and other parts of the District’s review, as applicable.

“Even when operating under emergency procedures, the Detroit District remains committed to following the NEPA process,” said Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff.

The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.

The EIS assesses the potential impacts of the Line 5 Tunnel Project and project alternatives (including the No Action alternative, an alternative that would install a protective gravel/rock cover over the existing Dual Pipelines in the Straits, and multiple pipeline decommissioning sub-alternatives, if the proposed tunnel were to be permitted) to land use and recreation; aesthetics; water resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology; soils; transportation and navigation; air quality; noise and vibration; socioeconomics; and reliability and safety.

In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act

The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.

The Record of Decision date is anticipated in fall 2025.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Lt. Col. Bandeff said. “These processes will inform the District’s permit decision.”

And in 2025, Ohio took bold steps to lead the way — proving that bottom-up reform and principled policy can challenge monopolies, drive innovation, and lower energy costs for families and businesses.

For years, Ohio energy consumers have borne the brunt of outdated and crony-driven utility practices. Coal subsidies cost ratepayers millions while permitting delays and monopoly protections stifle innovation and lock in higher consumer costs.

But with the passage of a groundbreaking energy reform bill, Ohio is showing how bold policy and grassroots action can reshape energy markets, lower costs, and restore power to the people — not monopolies.

And Americans for Prosperity helped drive this achievement — rallying support from the grassroots to key policymakers and proving the power of AFP’s bottom-up approach to policy reform.

A market-based energy overhaul

Ohio passed transformational energy legislation to promote energy independence, affordability, and innovation. It represents a fundamental shift in Ohio’s energy landscape by:

Ending daily coal subsidies to the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, saving ratepayers $450,000 per day

Eliminating electric security plans, which allowed utilities to lock in above-market rates — ensuring prices are now fairer and more competitive

Requiring market-based pricing for electricity, where rates are set by supply and demand instead of guaranteed utility profits — ending unfair advantages for monopolies

Accelerating permitting timelines to 45 days or fewer, cutting red tape and making Ohio one of the fastest in the nation for energy project approvals

Freeing the generation market, allowing more competition in how electricity is produced — unleashing innovation and affordability

These changes ensure that Ohio is an efficient, competitive, and consumer-driven energy market.

How energy reform happened

In 2024, AFP-Ohio launched a full-scale movement of its community-based grassroots army that mobilized:

Grassroots and digital: Activists knocked on thousands of doors and hosted dozens of grassroots events — including Lobby Day at the Capitol and community events at local gas stations.

Direct engagement with lawmakers: AFP demonstrated powerful lobbying efforts, including public testimony during recent committee hearings.

Empowered coalitions: AFP-Ohio locked arms with aligned organizations like The Buckeye Institute and the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association to form Ohio’s first pro-market energy coalition. Their shared voice shifted the conversation.

Emboldened policy champions: 22 AFP-backed state legislators — including reform leaders like Rep. Mike Dovilla — helped make the policy vision a reality.

At the heart of it all, when utility lobbyists pushed back, Ohioans pushed harder — and won.

A new energy era for Ohio — and beyond

Ohio’s energy overhaul is a model for the rest of the country. It proves what’s possible when policy champions follow a principled approach, with powerful grassroots advocates leading the way.

And thanks to your support, AFP-Ohio is backing the REINS Act, which would give elected lawmakers final approval over costly regulations — restoring accountability and transparency to the rulemaking process.

This initiative is gaining ground across the country, with victories already in Kentucky, Utah, and Wyoming.

AFP will continue to build on this momentum — in Ohio and across the country — to ensure every American has the tools to achieve their version of the American Dream.

The Antelope Valley BESS is LRE’s seventh low-carbon or carbon-free energy project in California and brings total installed capacity to 595 MW statewide. LRE announced the start of operations on its 352-MWh Chaparral Springs Bess in California earlier this month.

The 126-MW/504-MWh Antelope Valley BESS is powered by Powin Energy’s lithium iron phosphate batteries.

The battery storage will provide grid services to California’s electricity delivery system by storing energy during low demand and discharging during peak demand.

“Bringing the Antelope Valley BESS facility online is a major milestone for LRE and reflects our commitment to accelerating energy innovation in California,” said Sam Mangrum, EVP Project Execution at LRE, in a statement. “As our first stand-alone battery project, it expands our capabilities to deliver dispatchable power when and where it is needed most. We are proud to support the broader energy market as California transitions to a cleaner, more resilient grid that can meet growing demand.”

Earlier this year, LRE announced more than 700 MW of renewable energy projects in Oklahoma which will be supported by long-term power purchase agreements with Google. Construction has begun on the 372-MWac Mayes County Solar Portfolio, located just within one mile from Google’s data center in Pryor, Oklahoma. Together with the Twelvemile Solar Project 1 & 2 (152.5 MWac) and the Twelvemile 3 Solar Project (200 MWac), located in southern Oklahoma, these projects total 724 MW (alternate current) solar capacity in Oklahoma.

LRE purchased the Mayes County Solar Portfolio earlier this year from Red River Renewable Energy, LLC (“Red River”), a joint venture between SunChase Power, LLC and Eolian, L.P.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that solar and battery storage will lead all new power generation additions, even natural gas-fired plants, in 2025. The EIA estimated that more than 18 GW of utility-scale battery systems would be built in the U.S. this year, about 30% more than the record 14+GW achieved in 2024.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios.
“By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me.
You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal.
It will become “carbon negative,” it hopes, by purchasing carbon removal.","He’s obviously not the first to realize this. DAC companies and their scientists are well aware of the challenges they face. But investors are generally comfortable taking on risk across a host of different technologies and industries on the premise that at least a few of their portfolio companies will hit it big. As such, a nascent market and challenging physics are not inherent reasons to steer clear. DAC’s potential to secure cash-rich oil and gas industry buyers is pure upside.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios. At One Ventures itself has backed everything from producing oxygen on the moon (while also decarbonizing steel) to indoor solar cells and thorium-powered nuclear reactors, a hobbyhorse of techno-optimist nuclear bros and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. So the fact that Chi won’t touch DAC is no small deal.

His hesitation stems from a matter of scale.To capture that 0.04% of atmospheric carbon, many DAC companies use giant fans to pull in large volumes of air from the atmosphere, which then pass through either a solid filter or a liquid solution that chemically captures the carbon dioxide. Although some companies are pursuing alternate approaches that rely on passive air contact rather than energy-intensive fans, either way, the amount of air that reaches any DAC machine’s so-called “collection aperture” is minuscule “relative to the scale of planet Earth,” Chi told me.

He views this as the core pitfall of the technology. “Half of the [operating expense] of the system is just trying to go after a technical disadvantage that you took on from day one,” Chi said. “By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me. “Think about the aperture of all the forests on the planet. Think about the aperture of all the soils on the planet, all the wetlands on the planet, the ocean.” His preferred methods of carbon removal are all nature-based. “In addition, their sequestration tends to be photosynthesis-powered, which means we’re not burning natural gas or using grid electricity in order to go make that thing work.”

Nature-based solutions often raise eyebrows in the carbon removal and reduction space, though, bringing to mind highly questionable carbon offsets such as those earned via “avoided deforestation.” The inherent counterfactual — would these trees really have been cut down if we didn’t buy these credits? — is difficult to measure with any certainty, and a 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that the majority of these types of credits are essentially bogus.

This same essential question around measurability plagues everything from afforestation and reforestation to soil carbon sequestration, biochar application, and wetland restoration. It’s extremely difficult to measure how much carbon is stored — and for how long — within complex, open ecosystems. On the other hand, engineered solutions such as direct air capture or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are simple to quantify and promise permanent storage, making them attractive to large corporate buyers and easy to incentivize via mechanisms such as the federal carbon sequestration tax credit.

When I put all this to Chi, his response was simple. “It’s not an advantage to be able to measure something that can’t solve the problem,” he told me. For a moment, it seemed as if we had hit an intellectual dead end. For now, carbon removals and reductions are mainly driven by the voluntary carbon market, where prices are based on the exact tonnage of carbon removed. Reputable buyers don’t want to be burned again by investing in difficult to quantify offsets, and the current administration certainly doesn’t seem likely to step in with nature-based removal mandates or purchasing commitments anytime soon.

Chi’s answer to this conundrum is “financial enclosure,” essentially a fancy way of saying we need to monetize the value of nature-based systems. In many cases, he admitted, we don’t quite yet know how to do that, at least in a way that benefits the common good. “We figured out how to financially enclose a forest, clear cut it in order to go make board feed and paper and pulp,” he explained. But we don’t know how to financially enclose the benefit of preserving said forest, nor many other ecosystems such as wetlands that serve as highly effective carbon sinks.

At One Ventures has backed companies that work with a variety of buyers — from national governments to mining companies and farmers — that have a financial stake in (or are legally required to care about) ecosystem preservation and restoration. “Sometimes people break nature hard enough that it becomes that obvious. And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me. “We’re going to invest in the companies that make it possible to go do that at incredibly low cost structures.”

One portfolio company, Dendra Systems, uses robots, drones, and other automated methods to do large scale ecosystem restoration, such as replanting mangroves in parts of the world such as Myanmar and Abu Dhabi where they’ve been cleared for property development or industrial use. The governments of both countries are paying Dendra to do this after realizing that removing mangroves had catastrophic consequences —- destroying subsistence fishing, wrecking erosion breaks — that would cost more to ameliorate than simply replanting the trees.

Then there’s Dalan Animal Health, which is developing vaccines for honeybees as hives become more vulnerable to disease. While not directly focused on carbon removal, the company has successfully “financially enclosed” pollination, as industrial farmers whose crops depend on pollinators will pay for the vaccine. This helps restore healthy ecosystems that can ultimately draw down more carbon. Chi told me that insurance companies have also shown a willingness to pay for nature-based solutions that can help lessen the impact of disasters such as floods or hurricanes.

While the carbon benefits of these companies are simply a bonus, the firm has invested in one pure play removal company, Gigablue. This startup releases engineered particles into the ocean that attract carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. As the particles accumulate more plankton, they sink to the ocean floor, where the carbon is then stored. Using onsite sampling and other advanced techniques, Chi told me that this tech is “very measurable” while also having an “aperture [that] is as wide as the ocean area that we’ve sprinkled things onto.”

Though Chi dislikes the illogical nature of the voluntary carbon market — he would much prefer a “polluter pays” system where money is directed towards nature-based sequestration — he knows that with the markets we have, precise measurability is paramount. So At One Ventures is throwing money at this, too. Portfolio company Chloris Geospatial combines satellite data and machine learning to measure biomass from space and track changes over time, helping legitimize forest-based removals. And Miraterra is focused on novel sensing tech and advanced modeling that allows farmers to calculate the amount of carbon in their soil.

But even if the carbon stored in natural ecosystems never becomes quite as measurable as engineered carbon removals, Chi thinks investors, companies, or governments should still be going all in. “When your volume is so much larger, then you can even throw big error bars around your measurability and still be miles ahead,” he told me.

Many investors say they want it all. You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal. Chi, unsurprisingly, thinks that’s hogwash. “It’s weasel words to be like, it’s an important part of this portfolio,” he told me. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also advocates for a diversified approach, without saying DAC itself is strictly necessary. DAC is “not going to do 1%, and it’s going to be massively more expensive than your other 99%,” Chi said. “At some point you’re going to be like, why is this in the portfolio?”

It’s certainly a more blunt assessment of the industry’s viability (or lack thereof) than I’ve heard any investor hazard before. But there may be more folks starting to come around to Chi’s perspective. With government support for DAC in question and the utility of carbon capture tax credits — which only benefit engineered removals — deeply threatened, venture funding for DAC is down over 60% from this time last year, Bloomberg reported.

Rajesh Swaminathan, a climate tech investor at Khosla Ventures told the publication that while many investors have taken bets on direct air capture, “Now, people are stepping back and saying, ‘Why didn’t I look at the economics there?’” Khosla itself is an investor in the DAC company Spiritus.

So what’s a longterm skeptic like Chi to do in this moment of doubt? As he told me, “I’m just going to keep on giving talks on it, and I know that physics is on my side.”

The case concerned a proposed 88-mile train line in Utah that would connect its Uinta Basin (and its oil resources) with the national rail network. Environmental groups and local governments claimed that the environmental impact statement submitted by the federal Surface Transportation Board did not pay enough attention to the effects of increased oil drilling and refining that the rail line could induce. The D.C. Circuit agreed, vacating the EIS; the Supreme Court did not, overturning the D.C. Circuit in an 8-0 decision.

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires the federal government to study the environmental impact of its actions. The D.C. Circuit “failed to afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases and incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the Board to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court.

The court’s decision could sharply limit the ability of the judicial branch to question environmental reviews by agencies under NEPA, and could pave the way for more certain and faster approvals for infrastructure projects.

At least, that’s what Kavanaugh hopes. The current NEPA process, he writes, foists “delay upon delay” on developers and agencies, so “fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line.”

2. Trump targets solar on farmland

The Department of Agriculture is planning to retool a popular financing program, Rural Energy for America, to discourage solar development on agricultural land, Heatmap’s Jael Holzman exclusively reported.

“Farmland should be for agricultural production, not solar production,” a USDA spokesperson told Heatmap. The comments echoed a USDA report released last week criticizing the use of solar on agricultural land. The report said that the USDA will “disincentivize the use of federal funding at USDA for solar panels to be installed on productive farmland through prioritization points and regulatory action.” The USDA will also “call on state and local governments to work alongside USDA on local solutions.”

3. Oil companies sued over heat death

The daughter of a woman who died during the Pacific Northwest “Heat Dome” in 2021 sued seven oil and companies for wrongful death in Washington state court, The New York Times reported Thursday.

“The suit alleges that they failed to warn the public of the dangers of the planet-warming emissions produced by their products and that they funded decades-long campaigns to obscure the scientific consensus on global warming,” according to Times reporter David Gelles.

Several cities and states have brought suits making similar claims that oil and gas companies misled the public about the threat of climate change. Earlier this week, a German court threw out a suit from a Peruvian farmer against a German utility, which claimed that the utility’s commissions helped put his town at risk from glacial flooding.

The seven companies named in the lawsuit are Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and Olympic Pipeline Company, a subsidiary managed by BP. None of them commented on the suit.

4. Microsoft emits more

Tech giant Microsoft disclosed in its annual sustainability report that its carbon emissions have grown by 23.4% since 2020, even as the company has a goal to become “carbon negative” by 2030. The upside to the figures is that the growth in emissions was due to a much larger increase in energy use and business activity, not from using dirtier energy. In that same time period, Microsoft’s revenue has grown 71%, and its energy use has grown 168%.

“It has become clear that our journey towards being carbon negative is a marathon,” the report read. The company said it had contracted 34 gigawatts of non-emitting power generation and had agreements to procure 30 million metric tons of carbon removal.

The company has set out to reduce its indirect Scope 3 emissions “by more than half” by 2030 from the 11.5 million metric tons it reported in 2020, as its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fall to close to zero. It will become “carbon negative,” it hopes, by purchasing carbon removal.

Microsoft attempts to reduce emissions in its supply chain by procuring low- or no-carbon fuels and construction materials. Last week the tech giant signed a purchasing agreement with Sublime Systems for 600,000 tons of low-carbon cement.

5. Second SMR design approved

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it had approved a 77-megawatt small modular reactor design. This is the second SMR design approved by the NRC, following approval of a smaller design in 2020. Both are products of the SMR company NuScale, and neither has yet been deployed. A project to build the earlier design in Idaho was abandoned in 2023.

The NRC review was set to be completed in July of this year. Coming in ahead of scheduled demonstrates “the agency’s commitment to safely and efficiently enable new, advanced reactor technology,” the Commission said in a press release.

Congress and the Biden and Trump administrations have pushed the NRC to move faster and to encourage the development of small modular reactors. No SMR has been built in the United States, nor is there any current plan to do so that has been publicly disclosed. NuScale’s chief executive told Bloomberg that he hopes to have a deal signed by the end of the year and an operational plant by the end of the decade.

THE KICKER

Tesla veteran Drew Baglino’s Heron Power raised a $38 million round of Series A funding for a new product designed to replace “legacy transformers and power converters by directly connecting rapidly growing megawatt-scale solar, batteries, and AI data centers to medium voltage transmission,” Baglino wrote on X.

How much do we know about developers’ reactions to the anti-IRA bill that was passed out of the House last week?

So it’s only been a few days. What I can tell you is there’s a lot of surprise about what came out of the House. Industries mobilized in trying to improve the bill from here and I think a lot of the industry is hopeful because, for many reasons, the bill doesn’t seem to make sense for the country. Not just the renewable energy industry. There’s hope that the voices in Congress — House members and senators — who already understand the impact of this on the economy will in the coming weeks understand how bad this is.

I spoke to a tax attorney last week that her clients had been preparing for a worst case scenario like this and preparing contingency plans of some kind. Have you seen anything so far to indicate people have been preparing for a worst case scenario?

Yeah. There’s a subset of the market that has prepared and already executed plans.

In Q4 [of 2024] and Q1 [of this year] with a number of companies to procure material from projects in order to safe harbor those projects. What that means is, typically if you commence construction by a certain date, the date on which you commence construction is the date you lock in tax credit eligibility, and we worked with companies to help them meet that criteria. It hedged them on a number of fronts. I don’t think most of them thought we’d get what came out of the House but there were a lot of concerns about stepdowns for the credit.

After Trump was elected, there were also companies who wanted to hedge against tariffs so they bought equipment ahead of that, too. We were helping companies do deals the night before Liberation Day. There was a lot of activity.

We saw less after April 2nd because the trade landscape has been changing so quickly that it’s been hard for people to act but now we’re seeing people act again to try and hit that commencement milestone.

It’s not lost on me that there’s an irony here – the attempts to erode these credits might lead to a rush of projects moving faster, actually. Is that your sense?

There’s a slug of projects that would get accelerated and in fact just having this bill come out of the House is already going to accelerate a number of projects. But there’s limits to what you can do there. The bill also has a placed-in-service criteria and really problematic language with regard to the “foreign entity of concern” provisions.

Are you seeing any increase in opposition against solar projects? And is that the biggest hurdle you see to meeting that “placed-in-service” requirement?

What I have here is qualitative, not quantitative, but I was in the development business for 20 years, and what I have seen qualitatively is that it is increasingly harder to develop projects. Local opposition is one of the headwinds. Interconnection is another really big one and that’s the biggest concern I have with regards to the “placed-in-service” requirement. Most of these large projects, even if you overcome the NIMBY issues, and you get your permitting, and you do everything else you need to do, you get your permits and construction… In the end if you’re talking about projects at scale, there is a requirement that utilities do work. And there’s no requirement that utilities do that work on time [to meet that deadline]. This is a risk they need to manage.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM0NTcxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTc0MzQ5Nn0.dGxtMRfpqCRDmEpXaYtcgCTCRf7yDqiUVJ35uH5qy9Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-30 23:02:25.434247

Thus, the mere fact that another project’s environmental effects might be foreseeable is not enough.
The Court, moreover, explained that the adequacy of an agency’s NEPA review is a distinct question from an agency’s obligations under relevant substantive statutes.
The Supreme Court sent a clear and emphatic message to lower courts regarding the substantial deference owed to agencies under NEPA.
Those effects of the project itself, the Court explained, could constitute indirect effects that are properly within the scope of an agency’s NEPA review.","The Court’s decision is especially notable in two respects. First, it clarified that agencies may reasonably focus their environmental reviews on the project before them and need not consider effects of other separate projects, including those that fall within the jurisdiction of other agencies. The Seven County case arose from a decision by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) approving a short segment of planned railroad line in Utah, connecting an isolated oil production region to the national railroad grid. The Supreme Court held that, in approving the railway line, the STB had no obligation under NEPA to consider the potential impacts from crude oil production “upstream” of the railroad line, or from “downstream” oil refining or use of the transported oil. This holding marks a sea change in the context of large energy and other infrastructure projects, where the D.C. Circuit and other lower courts have for years required agencies to conduct extensive analysis of other projects and activities occurring “upstream” and “downstream” of the proposed agency action, including ever-expanding reviews of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change associated with activities far outside the acting agency’s jurisdiction.

Second, while that specific holding is extremely important in its own right for a broad range of energy and transportation infrastructure projects — from oil and gas pipelines to electric transmission lines — the Supreme Court’s decision also establishes broader guardrails that will guide environmental reviews by the full spectrum of federal agencies. The Supreme Court emphasized that reviewing courts must afford “substantial deference” to agencies under NEPA and should not second-guess agencies on the myriad technical judgment calls involved in conducting an environmental review, such as identifying potential environmental impacts, evaluating potential alternatives and their feasibility, and determining the scope of a proposed action’s environmental impacts and indirect effects.

Below we summarize the Court’s decision and provide several key takeaways.

Background

NEPA requires federal agencies undertaking “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” to prepare a “detailed statement” of, among other things, the “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action” and “a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed agency action … that are technically and economically feasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal.”3 In other words, NEPA requires agencies to take a “hard look” at the potential environmental consequences of a proposed action. NEPA’s requirements, however, are fundamentally procedural in nature; so long as the agency identifies and discloses relevant environmental information, NEPA does not require a reviewing agency to reach any particular outcome and does not foreclose the agency from approving a project notwithstanding its environmental effects.

The STB regulates the construction and operation of interstate railroad lines. By statute, it approves a new line unless it finds that it is “inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.”4 In 2020, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition applied to the STB for approval of the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile railroad spur line that would connect the isolated, oil-producing Uinta Basin to the national rail network.

In considering the application, the STB prepared and published a 600-plus-page environmental analysis; with appendices and other technical information the environmental impact statement (“EIS”) exceeded 3,600 pages. In addition to thoroughly considering a broad range of effects of the proposed railway itself, the STB noted the possibility of potential environmental impacts from increased upstream oil drilling in the Uinta Basin and downstream refining of the crude oil that might be carried by the railroad line, but the agency declined to analyze those latter impacts at length. On the potential increase in upstream oil production, the STB determined that the activities in question (e.g., further oil and gas leasing and development) fell outside the agency’s authority and that potential effects were both speculative and attenuated in relation to the railroad line. Similarly, on potential downstream impacts, the STB explained that it lacked statutory authority over the refining or use of crude oil and that it could not reasonably identify the specific destinations and customers to be served by the railroad line. In reaching those determinations, the STB relied on the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, in which the Court held that “where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions,” its NEPA review need not include that effect.5

The D.C. Circuit, however, vacated the railroad approval, concluding that the agency’s NEPA review was inadequate on several grounds. Specifically, the court criticized the STB’s failure to more extensively analyze potential increased oil drilling upstream of the project and increased oil refining activities downstream of the project. In the D.C. Circuit’s view, those potential upstream and downstream impacts were reasonably foreseeable consequences of approving the railroad line and thus fell within the agency’s NEPA obligations to consider fully. The court rejected the STB’s argument that because the upstream and downstream activities themselves fell outside of the agency’s regulatory authority, their potential impacts need not be further analyzed as part of the EIS.

The Supreme Court’s Decision

The Supreme Court reversed, in an emphatic opinion that provides important clarity and certainty for agencies conducting NEPA reviews, courts reviewing claims challenging the adequacy of NEPA reviews, and the private parties and other stakeholders who rely on permits and other federal agency actions subject to NEPA.

The Supreme Court found two independent (but related) errors in the D.C. Circuit’s approach.

1. “A course correction” that restores “substantial [judicial] deference” to agency NEPA reviews

First, the Supreme Court reiterated that, contrary to the overly “aggressive” and “intrusive” approach taken by certain lower courts, “the bedrock principle of judicial review in NEPA cases” is “deference” to the agency. The Court emphasized that the “only” role for courts under NEPA is to “confirm that the agency has addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives to the relevant project,” and that in doing so a court must afford “substantial deference to the agency.” In practice, such deference will extend to the broad range of issues that arise in NEPA reviews — not only scientific and technical questions long understood to implicate agency expertise, but also the inevitable series of “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of [a] [NEPA] inquiry” that affect the content and length of a NEPA document. These include:

the range of relevant environmental impacts to be considered and those impacts’ significance;

the range of potential alternatives and whether a particular alternative is feasible;

the range and geographic scope of indirect environmental impacts to be considered; and

the possibility and relevance of other projects separate in time or place (e.g., upstream, downstream, or otherwise) from the proposed action.

The Supreme Court explained that courts should not “micromanage” agency NEPA reviews so long as the agency’s choices fall within “a broad zone of reasonableness.” The Court pointedly criticized certain lower courts for having transformed NEPA from its original role as a “modest procedural requirement” into a “blunt and haphazard tool” to slow or even stop new infrastructure and construction projects, in a manner that has forced reviewing agencies “to take ever more time … to prepare ever longer EISs.”

The Supreme Court also emphasized that judicial review of an agency’s EIS “is not the same thing as review of the agency’s final decision concerning the project.” Thus, the ultimate question for reviewing courts is “not whether an EIS in and of itself is inadequate,” but rather whether “the agency’s final decision” — e.g., a permit or authorization issued pursuant to the agency’s substantive authority — “was reasonable and reasonably explained.” Thus, even if an EIS falls short in some respect, that deficiency does not necessarily require the Court to set aside (i.e., vacate) the agency’s ultimate approval of the project.

2. Limiting NEPA reviews to the “proposed action” before an agency — not other projects separate in time or space, or outside the action agency’s jurisdiction

Second, and independently, the Supreme Court refocused the required scope of NEPA reviews, holding that NEPA does not require an agency to consider environmental effects of other activities and projects “separate in time or place” from the proposed action, including projects that fall outside the action agency’s authority and that would be initiated by third parties. The Court thus held that (contrary to the D.C. Circuit’s approach) the STB need not consider upstream effects of potential increased oil production by third parties, or downstream effects of increased refining or ultimate use of oil transported on the proposed rail line. Under NEPA, the Court explained, an agency’s required review is focused on the “proposed action” at hand. It need not encompass other potential future projects or activities, or those that are geographically distinct from the proposed action, even if they might be “built (or expanded) as a result of or in the wake of the immediate project under consideration.”6

As the Supreme Court explained, those kinds of geographic, temporal, and agency-jurisdictional separations ultimately break the requisite causal chain “between the project at hand and the environmental effects of the separate project.” Under longstanding case law, an agency needs to consider environmental effects under NEPA only if they are reasonably foreseeable and have a “reasonably close causal relationship” to the proposed action. Thus, the mere fact that another project’s environmental effects might be foreseeable is not enough. Nor does it suffice that an agency’s approval of one project might be considered a mere “but-for” cause of other environmental effects; what is required is a “reasonably close causal relationship” akin to proximate cause. So, for instance, even if an agency’s approval of a new airport might lead to the construction of a new stretch of highway, or a new pipeline might lead to a new power plant, the agency approving the airport need not consider the environmental effects of the highway, nor must the agency approving the pipeline consider the effects of the power plant. As applied to the case at hand: “A relatively modest infrastructure project should not be turned into a scapegoat for everything that ensues from upstream oil drilling to downstream refinery emissions.”

Significantly, the Court also held that agencies “are not required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not exercise regulatory authority.” Thus, because the STB has statutory authority over railroad lines but not oil drilling or refineries, the STB was not required to consider the environmental effects of those activities — which are regulated by other agencies.

The Court did recognize that in some instances, projects may be sufficiently interrelated and close in time and place as to constitute “a single project within the authority of the agency in question.” And the Court recognized that there may be line-drawing questions associated with defining the project being proposed to a specific agency for consideration. Even in those circumstances, the Court emphasized, a court’s review must remain deferential, and it should uphold the agency’s approach so long as it drew a reasonable and manageable line.

Key Takeaways

Far fewer NEPA challenges premised on upstream or downstream effects? As a top-line takeaway, Seven County reaffirms the common-sense principle that under NEPA, an agency can and should focus on the project or action actually proposed to it — e.g., approval of a railroad line, midstream oil or natural gas pipeline, or a highway project. NEPA does not mandate that agencies consider the environmental consequences of other projects that are separate in time or place from the proposed action before the agency, or which fall outside that agency’s regulatory jurisdiction. Just as the Court agreed with the STB that it need not consider the environmental consequences of upstream drilling or leasing decisions or downstream refining activities, so too now should courts uphold an action by FERC approving a pipeline without considering upstream effects of increased gas production, or downstream environmental effects from combusting natural gas in power plants, factories, or homes.

More broadly, Seven County delivers a strong rebuke of certain lower courts’ tendency to require agencies to consider a broad range of upstream and downstream effects, no matter how speculative or attenuated, especially when the agency has provided a reasonable explanation for why it was drawing a manageable line. The concern has been particularly pronounced in litigation regarding agency analysis of greenhouse gas emissions under NEPA. Much of this caselaw has grown from the D.C. Circuit’s 2017 decision in Sabal Trail, which held that certain downstream greenhouse gas emissions from combusting gas transported in a FERC-jurisdictional pipeline constituted indirect effects under NEPA.7 Although Seven County does not say so explicitly, it is difficult to read the decision as anything but a de facto overruling of Sabal Trail and subsequent decisions requiring FERC and other agencies to consider a range of upstream and downstream indirect effects under NEPA.

Restoring NEPA’s role as a “modest,” purely procedural statute: The Court in Seven County took great pains to reiterate that unlike environmental statutes that impose substantive environmental obligations, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, NEPA is “purely procedural.” As such, NEPA does not require an agency to weigh or favor environmental consequences in any particular way, or to reach any particular environmental result. The Court, moreover, explained that the adequacy of an agency’s NEPA review is a distinct question from an agency’s obligations under relevant substantive statutes. The Court’s admonition that defects in an agency’s EIS do not necessarily warrant vacatur of an agency’s ultimate action should also provide a welcome check on the hair-trigger approach of some lower courts, which have too readily set aside major infrastructure permits and authorizations based on perceived NEPA foot faults.

Stepping back from the particulars of this case, Seven County can be understood as another link in a chain of Supreme Court cases — like Vermont Yankee, Metropolitan Edison, and Public Citizen — intended to curb lower courts’ unduly aggressive applications of NEPA. The Court was clear that its opinion was intended as “[a] course correction” to “bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.”

Deference to agencies. The Supreme Court sent a clear and emphatic message to lower courts regarding the substantial deference owed to agencies under NEPA. Going forward, the Court was clear that it expects many technical, scientific, and line-drawing decisions to fall to the discretion of the agency and not be second-guessed by courts. And the Court sought to put an end to the vicious cycle of risk-averse agencies resorting to ever extended review times and ever longer NEPA documents in an effort to survive judicial review.

The Court’s vigorous call for judicial deference under NEPA contrasts sharply with the requirement of independent judicial review of questions of law under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.8 The Seven County decision builds on, and helps illustrate, guidance from Loper Bright and other cases about the continued role for deferential judicial review of discretionary, technical, and agency policy decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act, notwithstanding independent judicial review on questions of law.

Deference, of course, means that agencies will retain a zone of discretion about the content and scope of their environmental reviews. The Court recognized that an agency’s discretion extends to questions such as the scope of indirect environmental effects, and whether the agency might voluntarily address effects from future or geographically separate projects that may be “initiated (or expanded) as a result of or in the wake of the current project.” But the Court made clear that NEPA does not compel an agency to consider such factors. And it underscored that in the event an agency denies a permit or authorization, an applicant could argue (among other things) that the agency acted unreasonably by “weighing environmental consequences too heavily in light of the agency’s governing statute” or perhaps that the relevant statute “did not allow the agency to weigh environmental consequences at all.” Those kinds of substantive arguments, the Court explained, were unaffected by NEPA.

Separate projects. As explained previously, the Court held that agencies are not required under NEPA to examine the environmental consequences of projects that are geographically or temporally distinct from the proposed action, or that fall outside the agency’s jurisdiction. In doing so, the Court cited examples like a new airport someday leading to a new highway; a new pipeline to a new power plant; or a new housing development to a new subway stop.

The Court cautioned, however, that certain projects may be interrelated or close enough in time or place that they constitute a single project that falls within the agency’s jurisdiction. In that instance, the environmental effects of two nominally separate projects may well warrant consideration in a single environmental document.9 But as framed by the Court’s opinion, that rationale would apply only to multiple projects that fall “within the authority of the [single] agency in question.” And even then, a reviewing court should afford deference to the agency’s line-drawing decisions.

The concurrence and the “public convenience and necessity” standard. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, concurred only in the judgment. They would have reached the same result as the Court, but on a narrower ground. In the concurring Justices’ view, the STB did not need to consider upstream or downstream effects of oil production or consumption because the STB lacked statutory authority to reject railroad applications based on how third parties would use the products transported on the railway line. This principle followed from the statutory common-carrier requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the bounds of what factors the Board could properly consider in applying the statutory “public convenience and necessity” standard. In the concurring Justices’ view, the “public convenience and necessity” standard must be understood in the context of the statute’s broader purpose, including the common-carrier requirement.

If adopted by lower courts, the concurring opinion’s gloss on the statutory “public convenience and necessity” standard could have follow-on effects in other statutory contexts involving the same language, notably including Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), which governs FERC’s approval of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The concurring Justices’ formulation of the “public convenience and necessity” standard appears narrower than the D.C. Circuit’s expansive understanding of that concept, as articulated in cases such as Sabal Trail.10 As a result, it could narrow the scope of what kinds of factors FERC must substantively consider under the NGA, with potential similar effects on other similarly worded statutes.

6 The Court recognized that the potential effects of the proposed action itself may in some circumstances “extend outside the geographical territory of the project or might materialize later in time,” such as run-off from project construction that could affect downstream waters or air emissions from a proposed facility that might travel downwind to other areas. Those effects of the project itself, the Court explained, could constitute indirect effects that are properly within the scope of an agency’s NEPA review. See Seven County Slip Op. 16.

Matt Edling, speaking on behalf of the city, said, “This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”","Two teams of high-powered lawyers clashed this week in Charleston, S.C., over a global-warming question with major implications: Do climate lawsuits against oil companies threaten national security, as President Trump has claimed?

In the lawsuit, the City of Charleston is arguing that oil companies including ExxonMobil, Chevron and about a dozen others carried out a sophisticated, decades-long misinformation campaign to cover up what they knew about the dangers of climate change.

There are some three dozen similar cases around the country, and recently Mr. Trump issued an executive order calling the lawsuits a threat to national security, saying they could lead to crippling damages. The hearings in Charleston were the first time lawyers had to grapple in a courtroom with the president’s assertions.

Mr. Trump’s executive order was the opening salvo in a broad new attack by his administration against climate lawsuits targeting oil companies. Citing the executive order, the Justice Department this month filed unusual lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan seeking to prevent them from filing their own climate-change suits. (Hawaii filed its suit anyway, and Michigan’s attorney general has signaled that she will also be proceeding.)

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of Gibson Dunn, who represents Chevron but was arguing on behalf of all the defendants, said the executive order was consistent with their position that federal law governs emissions and their impact, and that the climate-change lawsuits do not belong in state courtrooms.

Mr. Boutrous also said to the court that both Democrats and Republicans have promoted fossil fuel production in the interest of national security. Grappling with climate change is “not a partisan issue,” he said. “This is a difficult policy issue.”

Victor Sher, a lawyer for Charleston, said Congress is responsible for writing laws, not the president through the use of executive orders. But, setting that aside, he argued that the order was not relevant to Charleston’s case, because the lawsuit would not interfere with energy production. Rather, he said, the case revolved around the companies’ past acts of deception and failure to warn consumers about the risks of its products.

Judge Young appeared skeptical of the city’s claims. “It’s the weather we’re talking about,” he said.

The judge also asked whether cases like this meant that individuals could also sue over climate-change claims. He said he was concerned about “perpetual” lawsuits of this kind. “I’m trying to figure out how this ends,” Judge Young said.

Mr. Sher likened the litigation to lawsuits against industries like tobacco, opioids and asbestos. “There are innumerable instances where all levels of government have sued over corporate misconduct,” he said.

Mr. Boutrous cited a Supreme Court decision, written in 2011 by the liberal jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in which she wrote that disputes over greenhouse-gas emissions by power companies fall under the purview of federal agencies and federal judges. Energy-company lawyers often cite that decision as a key precedent in their arguments in other lawsuits against oil companies across the country.

Global warming is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, where they act like a heat-trapping blanket.

Much of the debate centered on whether the city’s case sought to restrict emissions. Mr. Sher said Charleston’s goal was not to limit emissions, but rather to generate money to help cover the costs of climate change — costs such as fortifying Charleston’s sea walls, improving drainage and protecting against hurricane damage. Taxpayers “would otherwise have to bear that burden,” he said.

The judge pressed Mr. Sher to describe whether gasoline ads should include a message about climate change, like the warnings about side effects in drug commercials.

The oil companies first tried, without success, to get cases like these moved out of state courts and into federal courts, where they felt they would have better chances of winning. None of the state court cases have yet gone to trial, but judges in numerous places have ruled against the companies’ motions to dismiss, including in Hawaii and Colorado, where state appellate courts upheld the decisions.

However, in other jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, energy companies have succeeded in getting cases tossed. And in Puerto Rico, the governor moved to dismiss a lawsuit filed by her predecessor.

The Charleston case has been the subject of debate locally. It was filed under a previous mayor, John Tecklenburg, and critics have called for his successor, William Cogswell, to drop the case. His office said it would be watching the proceedings closely. The state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has been a vocal opponent of climate-change lawsuits and filed an amicus brief in favor of the companies in the Charleston case.

As the hearings concluded on Friday, Judge Young asked whether it made sense for a global problem to be addressed in a South Carolina court. Matt Edling, speaking on behalf of the city, said, “This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30cli-sc-lawsuit-01-fpwt/30cli-sc-lawsuit-01-fpwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:03:41.844960

In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.
There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed.
The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.","Wyoming is the second windiest state, after Nebraska. It’s obvious why the wind power industry is investing $10 billion there. And it’s hard to see why any state politician would oppose this. But some have. Wyoming is one of those fossil-fuel producing states in which so-called conservatives feel obligated — or are paid — to stop competition from clean energy. Texas is another.

Wyoming State Sen. Larry Hicks proposed a temporary ban on renewable energy projects. “It does one thing: puts a moratorium on wind and solar for the next five years,” he said. “It’s a simple little bill.”

A “simple,” five-year plan? How do you say, “Aw, shucks” in Russian?

Hicks swiftly diverted blame to California: “Our friends on the ‘left coast’ with their renewable portfolio demands, eliminating fossil fuels and moving in a direction that’s unsustainable.”

We can’t untie this knot of confused ideology. But let’s point out that renewable energy is the only kind of energy that is, by definition, sustainable. Wyoming may have coal, oil and gas. But it has wind forever.

This hostility toward wind power is even weirder in Texas. Texas harvests more electricity from wind than any other state, or nearly 28% of all wind-generated electricity in the U.S. In one recent week, nearly half of Texas’s electricity came from solar and wind power.

The key for these renewables is batteries that can store power when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Texas has been crowned “ground zero” for a U.S. battery boom. Last year it switched on more power stored in batteries than California did.

Texas was expected to double its storage capacity this year — that is, until Donald Trump slapped huge tariffs on China. More than two-thirds of imported batteries come from China.

In March, the Texas Senate passed a mandate that half of all new power capacity come from sources other than battery storage. In other words, at least 50% of all new power plant capacity had to be produced from coal, natural gas and oil. (The natural gas industry needed propping.)

Back in Wyoming, lawmakers wedded to fossil fuels are complaining that large wind and solar projects are fundamentally changing the look of Wyoming’s wide-open spaces. That’s ignoring the aesthetics of Wyoming’s coal pits, wide open craters that stretch for miles.

Wyoming is over 63 times the size of Rhode Island, with less than half the population of the Ocean State. There are dozens of wind turbines in Rhode Island, onshore and off. More are planned with minimal complaint. Wyoming could easily accommodate new wind projects under its big sky.

There does exist public support for clean energy in Wyoming, which is why Hicks’ initiative failed. Gov. Mark Gordon tried to bridge the differences by endorsing an “all of the above energy strategy.” He wants to keep Wyoming as “the energy state” but also to address climate change by developing clean renewables.

The far-right Freedom Caucus went after Gordon for acknowledging climate change. It introduced a bill designed to stop the state from pursuing any carbon reduction targets and titled it “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.”

A pragmatic Republican, Gordon called such proposals as “a little bit stupid.”

The bottom line is that Wyoming continues to develop wind energy projects. The Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, now under construction near Rawlins, will be the nation’s largest wind farm.

Much of what happens from here on in depends on Washington. The recently passed House bill strips away subsidies for renewables. How it fares in the Senate remains to be seen. Suffice it to say, slowing America’s move to cleaner and also cheaper energy is more than a little bit stupid.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Cheniere Energy said on Friday it has begun annual maintenance work on its liquefied natural gas plant in Sabine Pass, Texas, the largest U.S. LNG plant.

Sabine Pass has annual capacity of 30 million metric tonnes per annum (mtpa) and has played a major role in making the U.S. the world's largest exporter of LNG.

""Planned maintenance activity is underway at Sabine Pass,"" a Cheniere spokesperson told Reuters by email.

Declines in U.S. LNG output usually have an impact on global prices.

The annual maintenance work is expected to reduce U.S. output of LNG for the next few weeks.

Gas flows to Cheniere's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass plant were on track to drop from 3.9 bcfd on Thursday to an 11-month low of 3.7 bcfd on Friday, while feedgas to the company's 3.9-bcfd Corpus Christi in Texas was on track to drop from 2.1 bcfd on Thursday to a two-week low of 1.6 bcfd on Friday.

Energy traders have said they expect total LNG feedgas to remain below April's record high in June with Cheniere planning about three weeks of maintenance on liquefaction trains at Sabine around June 2-23.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford’s projected $3 billion investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant that is 60% complete and slated to employ 1,700 workers.

Ford said at a policy conference of the factory 100 miles (161 km) west of Detroit,

If it doesn’t stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made.”

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026.

The tax-reform bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL (300750.SZ)

Ford said on Thursday,

I’m spending a lot of time talking about that with politicians. It’s a federal issue, but it’s also a state issue,

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

The company touted a letter from more than 100 Marshall-area business owners, school leaders, elected officials calling on Congress to retain the tax incentives, which noted the area has “lost thousands of jobs over the past several years.”

The House bill would also end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. The U.S. Senate plans to take up the bill and make changes in the coming month.

According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.
Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.","This story was originally published by MinnPost.

WASHINGTON — Gov. Tim Walz vigorously leveraged federal “green” tax credits — for electric cars, solar panels and other clean energy technologies and projects — that are now on the chopping block as Congress moves forward on President Donald Trump’s game-changing budget.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would cut social programs, extend Trump’s first-term tax breaks and raise the nation’s debt ceiling, would phase out former President Joe Biden’s ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gases — and hopefully make energy more affordable — by providing tax incentives to individuals and industry.

The proposal, approved by the U.S. House earlier this year, will likely be revised by the U.S. Senate. But when it comes to corporate efforts to invest in clean technologies, the bill has already had a chilling effect.

Canadian company Heliene, a maker of panels and other components of solar energy systems, said it’s holding off on its decision to build a new plant in Minnesota until the fate of the tax credits is clear.

Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk told MinnPost that a main concern is a power generation tax credit that benefits company clients that use the sun to generate electricity.

As it stands, the massive budget bill in the House is what Bloomberg called a “nightmare scenario for U.S. clean energy advocates.”

Under the legislation, wind, solar, geothermal and other emission-neutral projects would need to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's final passage — or start operations within two years — to receive the credits before they expire, mostly in 2028.

Currently, those credits could lower the cost of a project by 30% and were available for zero-emission projects until the early 2030s.

However, Harry Godfrey, managing director at Advanced Energy United, a clean energy business association, said a “poison pill’ was inserted into the program in the form of the new 60-day deadline.

“The bill was problematic to begin with,” Godfrey said. “But this was a meat cleaver.”

In addition, under the bill, any clean energy company that uses Chinese imports to build a facility or generate energy would be barred from receiving federal money. And the $7,500 tax break available to buyers of certain electric vehicles would be eliminated by the end of next year.

To add insult to injury, the legislation would also impose a $250 annual fee on owners of electric vehicles to compensate for lost revenue from gasoline taxes.

The bill would also phase out tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements and residential clean energy installations like solar panels.

“The clean energy transition is happening,” said Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., a champion of the clean energy provisions. ""The only question is if America will lead or follow, and I think we should lead.”

She called “recklessly” ending the incentives businesses are counting on to build “cheaper, cleaner energy” would force the United States to fall behind the rest of the world.

“We’re already seeing that these proposed changes are bad for business here in Minnesota,” Smith said. “Heliene paused construction of their solar manufacturing facility because of the cuts Republicans are pushing, and countless other projects are in limbo.”

‘Green New Scam’

Some of the clean energy tax breaks have existed for years and were implemented during the Carter, Bush and Obama administrations. But Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act expanded and extended them and added a few new ones to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

That effort was championed by Walz, who signed a law requiring utilities to provide 100% percent clean electricity in the state by 2040.

But Trump has waged war on the Inflation Reduction Act, calling it a “Green New Scam” and a waste of money and vowed to overturn most of its provision.

Still, the IRA’s tax credits have helped ramp up corporate investment in clean energy in Minnesota.

For instance, they helped Xcel Energy build a huge solar project near its Sherco coal plant site in Becker.

“Energy production tax credits provide numerous benefits to our customers and communities,” said Xcel Energy spokesman Kevin Coss. “We pass 100% of the savings to customers in the form of lower electricity rates, helping keep bills low.”

Coss also said Xcel uses the federal tax credits on projects that create jobs, raise local tax revenue and drive economic development, an argument echoed by clean energy advocates.

Another project attracted to the state by the promise of federal money is a “green” hydrogen production plant in Fridley. Green hydrogen is generated through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.

According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.

“The governor has made Minnesota a leader in clean technology and renewable energy by supporting electric vehicles and putting the state on a path toward 100% clean energy by 2040,” said Claire Lancaster, the governor’s spokeswoman. “But Minnesota stands to lose billions in federal funding that lowers energy costs by helping Minnesotans move toward more energy-efficient homes, cars, and electricity.

Lancaster also said that besides eliminating thousands of jobs, the legislation would leave Minnesotans more vulnerable to pollution, extreme weather events and the health and safety risks that they bring.

‘On track to raise energy bills’

The Senate is expected to make changes in the House-passed bill and clean energy boosters and the clean technology and energy industries are turning their full attention on the chamber.

Coss, of Xcel Energy, said “we are working closely with our industry partners, trade associations, and other stakeholders to ensure federal policymakers are made aware of the important benefits of these tax policies for their constituents.”

Green tax credit supporters say the end to innovation in the green energy industry will result in increased energy costs for homeowners, small businesses and industry, a 10% increase over the next few years as demand for energy grows.

“(Congress) is on track to raise people’s energy bills,” said Evergreen Action spokesman Seth Nelson.

Lobbying to save the tax credits has focused on four GOP senators who have sizable clean energy investments in their states because getting the bill through the Senate won’t be easy.

“I do think there are some persuadable senators,” Nelson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cannot lose more than three GOP votes because no Democrat is expected to support it.

And four Republican senators have expressed concerns over the elimination of the credits.

Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent Thune a letter last month warning against the obliteration of the IRA — and especially the green tax credits.

“Our country is blessed with abundant natural resources and an entrepreneurial spirit that uniquely positions us to power both our economy and the world — enabling U.S. leadership in innovation, energy production, and manufacturing alike,” the senators wrote. “Many of the investments that make this possible are enabled by current tax provisions, including some from the Inflation Reduction Act.”

At a press conference at a clean energy company in Utah this week, Curtis said he would “make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future.”

Other GOP senators are being targeted too. Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.

President Joe Biden's signature climate bill included several tax credits designed to help establish an EV supply chain and support consumer demand for plug-in cars.

Republican lawmakers are moving to unwind those policies. In addition to phasing out a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, the House-passed bill would end a manufacturing credit for battery makers after 2031.

It would also mandate strict restrictions against the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts say could effectively render it useless.

The complaint, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Montana, challenges three executive orders: “Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The lawsuit argues that with the orders, the Trump administration knowingly is advancing an agenda that will increase greenhouse gas pollution that already is stressing the global climate to a dangerous extent.

The litigation argues the situation infringes on the young people’s constitutional rights to life and liberty, as well as falling afoul of other laws approved by Congress that protect public health and the environment. The plaintiffs want the court to declare the executive orders unconstitutional, block their implementation and reaffirm the legal limits on presidential power.

“From day one of the current administration, President Trump has issued directives to increase fossil fuel use and production and block an energy transition to wind, solar, battery storage, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles (“EVs”),” the lawsuit states. “President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives.”

The complaint was filed on behalf of young people from Montana to Florida, ranging in age from 7 to 25, who have experienced wildfires, floods, hurricanes and extreme heat. Some have been displaced from their homes.

Others have endured health harms, such as a 7-year-old boy, identified by the initials J.K. in the lawsuit because he is a minor, who suffers from frequent respiratory infections. The infections are exacerbated by wildfire smoke and have landed him in the hospital. Greenhouse gas emissions, including those associated with fossil fuels, are heating the global climate, shifting weather patterns and leading to more extreme events such as wildfires and hurricanes.

Many of the plaintiffs are pursuing college degrees and careers in environmental science, and their research and professional goals have been disrupted as the Trump administration has eliminated jobs and funding for clean energy, climate research and decarbonization. Ula Jones, 18, was told by professors that some classes she planned to take may be eliminated. A 17-year-old who is identified by the initials J.M. in the litigation had helped her school secure a $400,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency for two electric buses, but the school never received the funding.

Some plaintiffs also have experienced mental anguish over the uncertainty climate change has cast on their futures. Among them is Olivia Vesovich, 21, who lives in Missoula, Montana.

“There are days when Olivia feels paralyzed by the devastation wrought by climate change to her state and community,” the lawsuit states. “Olivia’s climate anxiety is like an elephant sitting on her chest; it feels like a crushing weight, making it hard for her to breathe.”

The plaintiffs are represented by Our Children’s Trust, the Oregon-based advocacy group that previously brought the closely watched case Juliana v. United States, which sought to hold the federal government accountable for an energy system based on fossil fuels. That lawsuit claimed the government knew since 1965 that burning fossil fuels would lead to dangerous climate change.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined this spring to hear the case, ending the 10-year legal effort. But Our Children’s Trust said the legal framework established by Juliana inspired more than 60 youth-led lawsuits worldwide. In 2023 the group celebrated a groundbreaking victory in Montana, the first time a court in the U.S. declared that a government had a constitutional responsibility to protect people from climate change. The next year the group reached a settlement in Hawaii that included a plan to decarbonize the state’s transportation system.

Our Children’s Trust filed the latest litigation over the Trump administration’s executive orders in partnership with the Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law and Public Justice.

In addition to President Donald Trump, the lawsuit names as defendants multiple administration leaders and departments, including the EPA, Department of Transportation, National Science Foundation and the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance,” said Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, in a statement provided to Inside Climate News. “Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the lefts’ radical climate agenda.”

A recent report by risk management experts warned that climate change could cut the worldwide gross domestic product in half between 2070 and 2090. And last year, the U.S. was hit by 27 billion-dollar disasters.

Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old recent high school graduate living in Livingston, Montana, is one of the plaintiffs. Flooding destroyed roads and bridges near where she lived, forcing her family to relocate to a different town. Wildfire smoke leaves her short of breath and causes other symptoms such as headaches. She plans to study environmental science in college and worries about whether the Trump administration may limit her access to climate science and data.

This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.
These PFAS chemicals were part of the April 2024 national drinking water standards.
""We share the goal of protecting access to safe drinking water for all Americans, and we strongly support the establishment of a science-based drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS,"" the ACC said in its May 14 statement.
The ACC said EPA's proposal to amend the drinking water regulation looks to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities and minimize the impact on water bills.","WASHINGTON—The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it will keep maximum contaminant levels (MCL) in drinking water for two of the PFAS chemicals thought to be the most egregious of the ""forever chemicals.""

At the same time, however, the agency plans to extend the time to meet the target levels into 2031, and rescind and reconsider whether four other PFAS materials should be part of the drinking water regulation.

The actions taken by the EPA—now under the direction of Administrator Lee Zeldin in the second President Trump administration—brought a variety of reactions by both business and environmental groups.

The American Chemistry Council and National Organization of Manufacturers praised parts of the new direction, but also criticized some of what was outlined in the EPA's May 14 reveal of part of its new road map for PFAS.

Environmental groups, however, said backtracking on the other four PFAS chemicals that were part of the April 2024 first national drinking water standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that was put through during the Biden Administration will weaken the landmark protections.

The EPA said in its May 14 news release that it is committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water while ""following the law and ensuring compliance is achievable for drinking water systems.""

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" Zeldin said in a statement. ""We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.""

The EPA, as part of this action, said it intends to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS to reach the drinking water standard's MCL of between 4 and 10 parts per trillion from 2029 to 2031. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize it by the spring of 2026. The agency also will encourage states seeking to be the primary authorities to implement the PFAS drinking water regulation to request additional time from EPA to develop their applications.

At the same time, EPA will support the U.S. Department of Justice in defending ongoing legal challenges to the PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation with respect to PFOA and PFOS.

The EPA also said it will establish a federal exemption framework and boost outreach to water systems—particularly those in small and rural communities—through a new PFAS OUTreach Inititiative, or PFAS OUT for short. ""This action would help address the most significant compliance challenges EPA has heard from public water systems, members of Congress and other stakeholders, while supporting actions to protect the American people from certain PFAS in drinking water,"" the EPA said in its news release.

The agency added that when paired with effluent limitations guidelines for PFAS and other tools to ensure that polluters are held responsible, EPA's actions are designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, ""all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these.""

This includes announcing its intent to rescind the regulations and take another look at the regulatory determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act. These PFAS chemicals were part of the April 2024 national drinking water standards.

Zeldin said a big part of the EPA's efforts will be aimed at keeping the polluters accountable, rather than the drinking water systems the agency sees as ""passive receivers of PFOA and PFOS."" He added the EPA will take a number of actions to reduce the amount of PFAS in the environment, including in sources of drinking water, which in turn can reduce the cost burden for the water systems.

The American Chemistry Council spent a good part of its comments on the EPA's proposed update to the PFAS drinking water standard by criticizing how the April 2024 rule was put into place during the Biden Administration.

""We share the goal of protecting access to safe drinking water for all Americans, and we strongly support the establishment of a science-based drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS,"" the ACC said in its May 14 statement. ""With scarce resources and other water priorities, we need to thoughtfully follow sound science when developing these standards.""

But it claimed the regulation the EPA put in place last year was not consistent with the state of science or the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. It said the proposal was criticized by EPA's own Science Advisory Board and would impact ""millions of ratepayers across the country and impose severe consequences on many stakeholders, including local governments and water agencies.""

The ACC said EPA's proposal to amend the drinking water regulation looks to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities and minimize the impact on water bills.

""However, EPA's actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,"" the ACC said in its statement. ""The question is not whether to regulate specific substances but how to best do so in a manner that is consistent with the state of the science and focuses on the most pressing drinking water priorities for local communities.""

Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Manufacturers Association, said the NAM was encouraged that the EPA listened to the voices of manufacturers in looking to extend the compliance deadline for drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, along with looking to reconsider the regulatory determinations of the other PFAS compounds included in the April 2024 standard.

But he added that the EPA's decision to leave the standards for PFOA and PFOS in place doesn't match what Trump has been trying to accomplish for manufacturing.

""In addition to conflicting with manufacturers' best interests, these standards also go against the Trump administration's goal to make the U.S. the best place to build, grow and create jobs—a goal the administration is advancing by rebalancing regulations,"" Timmons said May 14. ""The administration has done remarkable work to advance that goal, but today's decision moves in the opposite direction.

""The decision runs counter to past efforts to cut red tape and boost manufacturing by putting shovels in the ground, more people to work, more products on the shelves and more prosperity into our communities. We don't have to choose between supporting manufacturing and clean water in our communities.""

The Environmental Working Group and National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) both were critical of the EPA's decision to delay implementation of the MCLs on PFOS and PFOA, along with the decision to rescind the limits on the four other PFAS chemicals.

""You can't make America healthy while allowing toxic chemicals to flow freely from our taps,"" EWG President Ken Cook said in a statement. ""The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it's sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come.

""The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases.""

The EWG said the PFAS contamination crisis is much larger than just two chemicals, and the current EPA plan to reverse the four MCLs is counter to an anti-backsliding provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act that requires that any revision to a drinking water standard ""maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons.""

It added that companies—including fluoropolymer producers 3M and DuPont—for decades hid the health harms of PFAS from regulators, workers and neighboring communities. PFAS have been linked to cancer, reproductive harm, immune system damage and other serious health problems, even at low levels, according to the EWG.

""Communities have waited decades for protection—now the EPA is pulling the rug out,"" said Melanie Benesh, EWG vice president of government affairs. ""Science is clear: PFAS are dangerous even in tiny amounts. The agency must protect all Americans, not just from two chemicals, but from the entire class of harmful PFAS.""

The NRDC said about half of the U.S. population is drinking PFAS-contaminated water, including as many as 105 million whose water violates the new standards. It maintained the EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health, including kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

After the April 2024 PFAS drinking standard was put in place, the NRDC said the chemical industries along with water utility trade associations sued to block the rule. The NRDC and its allies are seeking to protect the standards.

""With a stroke of the pen, the EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,"" said Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health at NRDC.""... But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities. With this action, the EPA is making clear that it's willing to ignore Americans who just want to turn on their kitchen taps and have clean, safe water.""

The EPA's latest action came less than three weeks after Zeldin outlined upcoming EPA action to address PFAS. This included in part the designation of an agency lead for PFAS, the creation of effluent limitations guidelines for certain PFAS to stop the forever chemicals from entering drinking water systems, and initiatives with Congress and industry to establish a liability framework ""that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.""",https://s3-prod.rubbernews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Water%20Supply-EPA_i.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:03:49.725445

The Associated Press

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change.
Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states.
In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.
The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs.","Twenty-two young plaintiffs, led by a contingent of Montanans who earned a landmark victory in the constitutional climate change lawsuit Held v. Montana, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Thursday against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, argue three of Trump’s executive orders issued earlier this year to “unleash” the fossil fuel industry and remove climate protections threaten their constitutional rights to life and liberty.

“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the lawsuit states. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”

The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held case, which prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, in the Montana Supreme Court. Lighthiser is joined in the suit by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and five others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California, and Florida.

Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation.

During a seven-day bench trial before Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in 2023, Held and 15 youth plaintiffs were found to have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”

The Held decision, affirmed by the state Supreme Court in December, is mentioned numerous times in the Lighthiser case, and several of the same law firms are representing the plaintiffs in the new suit.

Eleven federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA, are named as defendants along with the president.

Three of Trump’s executive orders — 14156, 14154 and 14261 — declare a “national energy emergency” and direct numerous federal agencies to “unleash American energy” by accelerating oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, and bolster fossil fuel development. They also roll back funding that bolstered climate protections, including through the Inflation Reduction Act. Various clean energy grant programs, including wind, solar battery storage and electric vehicles, were also targeted in the orders.

The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change.

“Plaintiffs were born into and now live in a destabilized climate system. Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states. “… EPA reports that climate change effects, including heat, displacement, financial or food insecurity, loss of recreation, loss of sleep, and risk of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), harm children’s health.”

The plaintiffs are asking for the court to find the three executive orders “and any implementing executive actions” unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid, and seek a permanent injunction against implementing and enforcing the orders.

In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.

“Promoting domestic energy production is crucial for shielding American families from price volatility and securing a stable energy supply for our nation and its allies. The President has a proven history of bolstering American energy production and will restore our nation’s position as a global energy leader,” Fields said in a statement.

A representative for the Department of Justice declined to comment.

In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser said Trump’s executive orders amount to a “death sentence for my generation.”

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.”

In the suit, the plaintiffs list harms experienced in their young lives related to climate change, including from longer wildfire seasons that affect their health, increasingly extreme weather patterns that affect their livelihoods, and changes to their local environments and cultural homes. The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs.

The complaint also condemns the federal government’s directives to implement the executive orders by “a wholesale scrubbing, suppression and dismantling of government agencies’ climate science, thereby blinding the government,” and argues that the President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority— “acting ultra vires” — in issuing the executive orders.

The youth are represented by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice.

The people least responsible for climate change, the pope pointed out, are bearing the greatest burdens because of it.
Stifling progress now, Mr. Misleh warns, threatens to exacerbate existing climate difficulties, particularly in the form of extreme weather events.
In the end, this will cost lives, especially in the places least able to build an infrastructure to mitigate the effects of climate change.
But the encyclical succeeded in tying the science together with a moral call to address the social inequities created by climate change.","“Laudato Si’,” which celebrated its 10th anniversary on May 24, will surely stand among the most important components of Pope Francis’ legacy. The encyclical neatly laid out the church’s concerns regarding care of creation, the impact of climate change, and the moral obligations of wealthier societies and individuals in countering the social and spiritual ills of overconsumption. The people least responsible for climate change, the pope pointed out, are bearing the greatest burdens because of it.

There are some signs of progress in addressing the questions raised in “Laudato Si’.” There are also intimations of backpedaling, particularly by the Trump administration, which has joined a small chorus of deniers regarding the industrialized world’s malign effects on creation.

President Donald Trump’s efforts to reverse U.S. progress on sustainable energy, electric vehicle adoption and addressing the worst consequences of climate change began on the night of his inauguration, when he signed a flurry of executive orders on energy and environmental policy. He declared a dubious “national energy emergency,” ordered the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and set a new policy that aims to maximize fossil fuel production in Alaska and encourage energy production on federal lands.

He rolled back Biden-era emissions standards and blocked new wind energy production. And his retrograde attention to the environment has continued apace. The president has vowed to end tax credits for electric vehicles and terminate a program meant to construct more charging stations for electric cars across the country.

The president’s efforts risk far more than reputational harm to the United States, says Dan Misleh, the executive director of Catholic Climate Covenant. Stifling progress now, Mr. Misleh warns, threatens to exacerbate existing climate difficulties, particularly in the form of extreme weather events. In the end, this will cost lives, especially in the places least able to build an infrastructure to mitigate the effects of climate change.

“It’s just heartless and it’s cruel because they’re now extending the period of climate catastrophe by probably decades.” But no one should be surprised, Mr. Misleh suggests. “If the administration can just wholesale cut [the U.S. Agency for International Development] and [in doing so] condemn millions of people to death, [it] can also pull back on the protections that we should be benefiting from—clean air, clean water, healthy land, healthy food, all of those things are now subject to the slash-and-burn tactics of this administration.”

The “Laudato Si’” Effect

Mr. Misleh recalls with fondness the “heady” days when “Laudato Si’” was first published. The pope already had been enjoying worldwide popularity because of his pastoral style and attention to the plight of global migrants. “And then he writes an encyclical on the environment, which with a name like Francis, I guess was to be expected.”

Ecological advocates in both the secular and ecclesial worlds were quickly singing the encyclical’s praises. “People were saying, ‘This is the most important document ever written on the environment,’ those kinds of superlatives. It really came out with a punch.”

The encyclical surely made Mr. Misleh’s job easier. Since its publication, “Laudato Si’” has been a prime mover in the expansion of church-based national and international efforts focused on addressing climate change and care of creation, including Catholic Climate Covenant, founded by Mr. Misleh. “We’ve relied heavily in the last 10 years on ‘Laudato Si’,’ not only as an excellent teaching document, but to motivate people to become engaged in the issue,” he says.

Covenant-sponsored, parish-based “creation care” teams “didn’t even exist when ‘Laudato Si’’ came out.” Now more than 400 of them work through the national campaign, and 35 have been established at the diocesan level, he reports.

“We’ve put a lot of time and resources into developing our youth and young adult programming, which is going very well,” Mr. Misleh says. “Young people are really happy to see that their church is engaged in these issues.” And a spinoff consultancy to develop sustainable energy infrastructure at Catholic churches and other sites, Catholic Energies, has been engaged for more than 30 projects in 14 states and in Puerto Rico.

Before “Laudato Si’” was published, Catholic environmental advocates had plenty of data and scientific reports about the dangers of climate change and the acute need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the encyclical succeeded in tying the science together with a moral call to address the social inequities created by climate change.

The pope taught that “we don’t have a social problem and an environmental problem. We have a problem that’s both social and environmental,” Mr. Misleh says.

“Laudato Si’” first promoted the pope’s notion of integral ecology and integral economics, identifying the self-inflicted spiritual and material wounds of affluence at the heart of the crisis. Francis, Mr. Misleh says, “connected it all together—those three relationships that all need attention: our relationship with God, with each other and with the planet,” and taught that “when any one of those was not tended to, the others suffer.”

That insight has been a key part of the success of “Laudato Si’” as a teaching document, framing the environmental crisis as synonymous with social and spiritual crises, and prescribing a response “not as an add-on [but] central to the practice of our faith.” Francis began using terms that became central themes of his papacy, Mr. Misleh adds, admonishing a “throwaway culture” and the “globalization of indifference.”

Clean energy, an unstoppable force?

There has been notable progress since the publication of “Laudato Si’” as a transition to renewable energy has been accelerating around the world.

And while the United States now leads the world in oil and natural gas production, the World Resources Institute reports that renewable energy “vastly outpaced other generation sources and collectively accounted for around 90% of the United States’ new installed capacity in 2024.” The report continues: “With the new projects online, renewables (including wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower) and battery storage now make up 30% of the country’s large-scale power generating capacity. In 2024, all carbon free electricity sources, including nuclear, supplied nearly 44% of electricity, while renewables, including small-scale solar, supplied nearly 25%.”

Though the rate of adoption of battery electric-powered vehicles has slowed, and new administration policy directly targets the continued expansion of the electric vehicle market, in 2024 a record-breaking 1.3 million electric vehicles were sold in the United States, about 9 percent of all new cars sold.

Mr. Misleh appreciates that progress but worries that much more needs to be accomplished. “Emissions have flattened, that’s for sure, but they’re not going down,” he says. “‘Flattened’ is not good enough. We need to continue to try to reduce our emissions, simplify our lifestyles, embrace not just the technology, but the disposition that we need to take care of this planet for future generations.”

People are more aware of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he says, to prevent what climatologists predict would be catastrophic 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warming above pre-industrial levels by 2050. (A new analysis reports that the 1.5-degree threshold has already been breached.)

If spiritual and scientific evidence is not enough to raise public awareness, contemporary market forces are likely getting people’s attention, according to Mr. Misleh. “People are realizing that to put solar [panels or shingles] on my home, in many places, is now less expensive than paying for the dirty energy that comes from power plants. That’s why our Catholic Energies program has been successful—because it makes economic sense to do this.”

Sharp increases in homeowners’ insurance because of the increasing threat of fire and flood, he adds, help connect the dots for many individuals between greenhouse gas emission and increasingly common extreme weather events.

“Everybody’s been impacted in some way by climate change, whether they know it or not—these massive floods, these extended droughts, these crazy wildfires that take out thousands of buildings in Los Angeles—all of this,” he says. “People are beginning to wake up and say, ‘Oh, maybe, there is something to this climate crisis after all.’”

That does not seem to be the case in Washington under the new administration, which has taken unprecedented steps to squash new climatological research that would likely support the global scientific consensus on climate change. Mr. Trump seems uniquely, almost vindictively, determined to push back progress already made.

But a report from Columbia Business School suggests market forces and an activist role among state governments, which are more likely to appreciate the positive local impact of the sustainable energy transition, could frustrate the president’s desire to “drill, baby, drill.”

The president has recently frozen clean energy investments that were part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. But that may prove a temporary setback. Researchers at Columbia write that the I.R.A. “is an effective and popular piece of legislation with significant bipartisan support in and out of Congress.”

They add: “Since its passage in 2022, around three-fourths of clean energy investments have been made in Republican states, fueling job creation in regions that have historically depended on oil and gas.”

The clean energy transition, these researchers report, is no longer an artifact of a political or ideological agenda but “an economic reality, with red and blue states alike leveraging federal and state incentives to attract investment and modernize infrastructure.”

In fact, the red state of Texas “has surged ahead of former solar leader California, reaching 27.5 GW of utility-scale capacity in 2024—approximately one-fifth of the country’s total.”

But the substantial progress in Texas has perversely become targeted by the state’s Republican legislators, following the Trump administration’s lead. Texas G.O.P. legislators are pressing new standards that could hamstring wind and solar energy development. In Washington, Lee Zeldin, appointed head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in March, said the agency’s new mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business,” ignoring the agency’s historic responsibilities to protect public health and the environment.

He quickly repealed scores of significant federal environmental regulations, including limits on industrial and tailpipe pollution and containment of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet, gleefully declaring, “[W]e are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

But “it’s not a religion,” Mr. Misleh says, “it’s science.” And it is also big business.

The administration’s proposals will thwart innovation on sustainable energy, battery production and electric vehicles, sacrificing America’s global leadership on these emerging technologies and potentially vast commercial opportunities for U.S. businesses and working people. Other nations will surely step in to fill the void that the administration is creating.

China, the world’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, has over the last half-decade surged ahead on clean energy. It is turning to renewables as it contends with catastrophic air, land and water pollution caused by its historic reliance on coal.

According to a report from the Yale School of the Environment: “Fossil fuels now make up less than half of China’s total installed generation capacity,” and China is on track to reach significant clean energy goals years ahead of schedule.

The United States made similar clean energy pledges during the Biden administration. That appears to be a matter of indifference to Mr. Trump.

“We could be the leaders in this technology globally and make a handy profit on it too,” Mr. Misleh says. Instead, “we’ll be less safe and less secure because other countries will step into this void.”

Countering a revival of denialism

U.S. Catholics concerned about climate change will have to be on their best game in this era of White House denialism.

“Certainly our first order of business is to always pray about this and to try to simplify our lives,” Mr. Misleh says. But “in terms of advocacy, we’re turning our attention to the states.”

“It’s all [playing] defense at the federal level, but at the state level, we’re going to push for more renewable energy portfolio standards and tighter pollution controls.”

That does not mean surrendering the field in Washington. “We need to be loud about the wrong-headedness of this dramatic scaling back of environmental protections,” Mr. Misleh says. “It’s going to impact our children. It’s going to impact low-income people especially.”

In that effort, Mr. Misleh is confident that he can count on the backing not just of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington but of Francis’ successor in Rome. Pope Leo XIV has “already said a number of things about the environment, linking it to questions of poverty and equity,” Mr. Misled says. “I see him very much following in the footsteps of Pope Francis.

“But all of this teaching goes back not just to Francis,” he quickly adds. “It goes back to Benedict and John Paul II and Paul VI, for that matter. This teaching has become a core part of who we are as Catholics, and I don’t see Pope Leo backtracking on that in the least.”

High-performance polymer materials called lithium-ion battery polyimide (PI) binders are used in battery electrodes to improve mechanical stability, thermal resistance, and chemical durability. During charging-discharge cycles, these binders ensure the structural integrity of electrodes by providing superior adhesion and flexibility. In contrast to conventional PVDF binders, PI binders have exceptional electrochemical stability, which makes them perfect for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Applications for lithium-ion battery PI binders are used in a variety of industries, including electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESS), and aerospace. The use of PI binders is being driven by the growing need for high-energy-density, long-cycle-life batteries in consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems (ESS).

Additionally, the demand for advanced battery materials is being driven by the EV sector's rapid growth, which is being driven by strict emission regulations and government incentives. Furthermore, the use of PI binders is being accelerated by safety concerns related to lithium-ion batteries, especially in high-temperature and high-voltage applications. Their superior heat resistance increases battery reliability by lowering the possibility of thermal runaway. As a result of tighter regulations and rising consumer demands for durable, safe batteries, manufacturers are incorporating PI binders to increase overall battery stability.

Additionally, as environmental concerns grow, manufacturers of batteries are concentrating on sustainable materials and production techniques. Global sustainability goals are aligned with PI binders because of their improved recyclability and minimal VOC emissions. In order to support more advanced battery technologies, this trend is driving investigations into environmentally friendly binding methods. However, when compared to conventional binders like PVDF, the cost of producing polyimide binders is high since it requires advanced polymer synthesis. Costly materials and complicated processing requirements restrict its widespread use.

The cuts came amid rising fears over what the future holds for federal clean energy policy and tax credits.
More than 13,000 jobs and over $12 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled so far in Republican districts this year.
Since Congress passed federal tax credits for clean energy in August of 2022, 45 announced projects have been closed, downsized or canceled.
More than $16 billion in investments and 20,000 jobs were associated with the abandoned projects.","More than $14 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled or delayed in the United States since January, according to a new analysis by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), a nonprofit clean energy business group.

The 2025 losses have also cost 10,000 new jobs in low-carbon energy and clean vehicle factories, a press release from E2 said.

The cuts came amid rising fears over what the future holds for federal clean energy policy and tax credits. In April, $4.5 billion in new electric vehicle (EV), battery and wind energy projects were canceled by companies in advance of the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of an enormous tax and spending package — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — which would essentially do away with clean energy tax credits passed in 2022.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2, in the press release.

E2 tracked another $1.5 billion in projects that had been canceled in previous months.

Ahead of the Senate’s consideration of the legislation, the analysis by E2 shows that over 10,000 announced jobs were already canceled amid apprehensions over the bill’s advancement.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are canceled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” Timberlake added.

Republican congressional districts have been experiencing the most cancellations despite benefitting the most from the tax credits. More than 13,000 jobs and over $12 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled so far in Republican districts this year.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” said Executive Director of E2 Bob Keefe, as The Associated Press reported.

Through April of 2025, more than 61 percent of all announced clean energy projects — as well as 72 percent of jobs and 82 percent of investments — were in Republican congressional districts, the press release said.

Tennessee and Georgia are especially at risk because they have made major investments in the production of EVs and batteries, according to Marilyn Brown, a professor of energy policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who did not participate in the analysis, reported The Associated Press.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, a Cornell University engineering professor, who was not involved in the analysis.

In an April letter, some Republican lawmakers told Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota that a repeal of the tax credits could weaken the U.S. position as a world energy leader.

However, as cancellations rise, businesses are still investing in the country’s clean economy. Companies announced almost $500 million in investments in April for new factories to produce solar, EV, grid and transmission equipment across six states. These include a $400 investment for the expansion of a Michigan solar wafer factory that is predicted to create a minimum of 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment from a solar equipment manufacturer in Canada to build a new solar plant in North Carolina.

If completed, the seven projects are expected to create almost 3,000 new permanent jobs.

So the return of Musk to Tesla is something of a mixed blessing.","It is hard to tell how Elon Musk’s whirlwind four months in Washington were anything but bad news for his biggest company, Tesla.

The brand’s sales are falling everywhere, and Americans have increasingly dark views of the electric-car company and its new robotaxi. Musk’s job is to clean up the mess, even though some inside Tesla think he is part of the problem.

Today, President Donald Trump officially saw Musk off with a press conference in the Oval Office. “I want to thank Elon for helping,” Trump said, while Musk made clear he’s not done with Washington — a city where he has left plenty of appointees burrowed into the federal bureaucracy, and where his companies have a lot of regulatory and contracting business to conduct. “I’ll continue to be visiting here,” he said.

Musk’s track record as a government cost-cutter is up for debate. His bold pledges of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget when he started the Department of Government Efficiency have shrunk to about $150 billion, and even that is contested. And he has said he worries that the House version of the GOP megabill will erase any gains that DOGE made.

And now the Tesla CEO returns to an automaker in a sales and reputational crisis.

Sales are down in China, whose home-grown automakers spin out EVs that are cheaper and, to some, more exciting than Tesla’s. Sales are cratering in Europe, where car buyers are enticed by a growing roster of EVs — including China’s — and turned off by Musk’s embrace of far-right figures.

And in Tesla’s home U.S. market, there’s abundant evidence that Musk has vaporized the company’s goodwill. It turns out that being the strident face of mass government layoffs isn’t a great look when many of your company’s customers were drawn to the Musk who made gasoline-free transportation cool.

Reviving Tesla

A survey in early May asked more than 8,000 Americans what they thought of EV automakers. The poll by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report found that Tesla’s reputation was the worst across every demographic, and 38 percent said their views had darkened over the past six months.

Musk intends to work his way out of this bind by focusing on Tesla’s new and disruptive projects: the Optimus robot and the robotaxi, which Musk just confirmed will take to the streets of Austin in June. There too, Tesla faces headwinds.

Meanwhile, moves that Congress made last week could collectively slash Tesla’s profits and make it harder for Detroit automakers and smaller EV competitors like Rivian to succeed. The House’s version of the Republican megabill would eliminate incentives to buy and make EVs, while the Senate voted to kill California’s Environmental Protection Agency waiver that allowed the state to require high EV sales.

The end of that waiver — combined with Trump’s watering down of emissions standards — will eliminate credits that Tesla could have earned by selling them to other automakers. Federal and state regulatory credits have earned Tesla $10.7 billion over a decade.

So the return of Musk to Tesla is something of a mixed blessing. On the plus side: Dan Ives, a financial analyst for Wedbush Securities, called Musk’s new focus “music to the ears of Tesla shareholders.”

Now Tesla’s chief has to show he can change the narrative.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Alex Guillén breaks down a Supreme Court ruling that says federal agencies can conduct narrow environmental review for energy projects and how that could affect legal challenges to Donald Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda.

Power Centers

Backdoor bid to slash regulation

The Environmental Protection Agency’s upcoming proposal to undo Biden-era limits on power plants’ greenhouse gas emissions is expected to argue that the U.S. electricity sector doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change.

If EPA’s argument survives legal challenges, it could offer cover for the agency to stop regulating planet-warming emissions from a wide range of sources under the Clean Air Act, Jean Chemnick reports.

Cycle of litigation

Trump’s energy emergency declaration has offered help to oil, gas and coal companies trying to get federal permits faster and, therefore, build faster. But Trump’s moves could backfire, leaving projects tied up in court for years, Mike Soraghan reports.

The reality is that Congress hasn’t repealed the environmental laws that guide permitting and environmental analysis. And though a Thursday ruling by the Supreme Court limited the scope of environmental reviews, agencies will still be required to thoroughly examine the direct effects of energy projects.

Europe’s 2040 goal

The European Commission’s 2040 climate target is expected on July 2. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said this week that the EU executive would propose a 90 percent target for cutting emissions.

The plan builds in flexibility for individual countries. For instance, countries could meet their goals through the use of international carbon credits tied to overseas projects, Zia Weise reports.

In Other News

Costs piling up: Many of Trump’s regulatory reversals will pile more costs onto individual Americans in the form of higher bank fees and electricity and water bills.

Cutting rigs: U.S. drillers cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fifth week in a row to the lowest since November 2021, according to Baker Hughes.

two businesses in Alabama.

American Cast Iron Pipe Company and United States Pipe and Foundry Company, LLC were both set to receive $75 million in grant money from the Department of Energy but will no longer receive the funding in light of the grants getting canceled.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a DOE press release. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

A message was left with both companies Friday seeking comment.

According to a press release, American Cast Iron Pipe Company made it to the negotiation stage of the awards process and was planning to use the funding to replace single cupola furnaces with four coreless induction furnaces. This would have reduced the facility’s CO2 emissions by an estimated 62% and the melting/holding process CO2 emissions by 95%.

The U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company said in a press release that they planned to use the money for Phase 1 of U.S. Pipe’s Iron Electric Induction Conversion project. The project involved replacing a coke-fired furnace with electric induction melting furnaces and would have resulted in an “estimated 73% reduction in carbon intensity at the Alabama Works ductile iron pipe production facility.”

Of the 24 awards given, nearly 70% were signed between Election Day last year and Jan. 20. By cancelling the awards, the Department of Energy is generating $3.6 billion in savings for Americans.

The DOE said the awards have been terminated because they “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47657/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/birmingham-alabama-1024x6801748640362.jpg?h=50844e28&itok=mPgST9rm,N,,2025-05-30 19:08:49.918214

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who chairs the EPA funding panel, knocked the Trump administration this month for “indiscriminate” funding freezes, an “unserious” budget request and “massive” reorganizations within agency.

Expanding upon the so-called skinny budget the White House transmitted to Capitol Hill earlier this month, the new documents detail the White House’s ambitions for spending cuts across government agencies. They show which accounts the president wants GOP lawmakers to target as Trump seeks non-defense funding cuts of more than 22 percent in the upcoming fiscal year and a flat military budget.

Besides the White House’s release Friday of a more than 1,200-page appendix to Trump’s May 2 budget request, individual agencies also posted their own “budget in brief” documents. Among the proposed cuts to most federal departments, the administration is asking Congress to slash $12 billion from federal education programs, $5 billion from agriculture efforts and a total of more than $60 billion from health, housing and community development work.

Senior GOP members of both the House and Senate have already scorned Trump’s initial budget request, heightening the conflict between Republicans on Capitol Hill and those in the Trump administration as Congress races to head off a government shutdown in four months.

Many of the budget documents the Trump administration posted Friday were full of zeros. The Education Department’s brief, for example, contains entire pages of programs the Trump administration wants to eliminate, including federal grants that support preschools, education services for homeless children and those living in rural areas.

The Environmental Protection Agency is asking Congress to eliminate funding for dozens of grant programs, including those that support the enforcement of pesticide rules, pollution control and restrictions on toxic substances.

On Capitol Hill, top Republican appropriators have said they won’t cut the EPA as deeply as Trump wants. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who chairs the EPA funding panel, knocked the Trump administration this month for “indiscriminate” funding freezes, an “unserious” budget request and “massive” reorganizations within agency.

Just how deeply congressional Republicans are willing to slice into federal programs will start to become clear next week, when House GOP appropriators plan to debut the first of a dozen annual funding bills. That includes the measure that covers agriculture programs and the Food and Drug Administration, and the bill that funds initiatives supporting military construction and veterans.

The White House has not threatened to veto funding bills that exceed, or depart sharply from, the president’s request. But Trump’s budget chief has said the administration hasn’t ruled out continuing to use “impoundment” to withhold congressionally approved funding the administration doesn’t want to spend.

“Impoundment is still on the table and something we will consider,” White House budget director Russ Vought said this week on Fox Business, repeating what he said earlier this month at the time of the skinny budget’s initial release.

That threat has irked Republican lawmakers who argue that the tactic is illegal under the 51-year-old law created to prevent presidents from undermining the “power of the purse” Congress is granted under the Constitution.

Whatever government funding legislation makes it to Trump’s desk in the fall will first need the support of several Democrats in the Senate, where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is under pressure to hold the line against drastic cuts after caving in March to help advance the stopgap bill Republicans unilaterally crafted after abandoning bipartisan negotiations.

Attracting Democratic support in the Senate is likely to require higher funding levels, which could prompt Republican opposition across Capitol, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole acknowledged this month.

“Anything they do to get Democratic support in the Senate — which they have to do under their own rules — will almost certainly cost me Republican support over here,” said the Oklahoma Republican.

That was not the case earlier this year when House GOP leaders mustered near-unanimous GOP support in their chamber to pass a funding patch through September. However, several House Republicans have already warned they won’t back another stopgap this fall, insisting instead on enactment of full-year appropriations bills. Lawmakers in both parties also want to pass updated funding levels, while locking in earmarks to ensure federal cash flows to specific projects in their districts.

“I don’t want to do it again,” Cole told reporters this month about the prospect of another short-term funding measure. “I want to deal.”",https://static.politico.com/3b/04/17cee9994bdfa16530a7facb4e36/u-s-congress-05573.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 19:08:32.620984

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

Texas is home to two nuclear power plants, but both are aging.
The Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant's first phase was completed in 1990 after several delays and setbacks since construction began in 1974.
The South Texas Project in Matagorda County, about 90 miles south of Houston, began operations in 1988.
As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.","A sweeping proposal to provide up to $350 million to private companies to help them build advanced nuclear power generation plants in Texas is one step away from reaching Gov. Greg Abbott's desk after the House author said Thursday that he expects the chamber to accept tweaks made by the Senate.

""Yessir,"" state Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, told the American-Statesman in a text message response to a question about whether he'll recommend sending the Senate's version of the bill to the governor. Abbott signaled early in the legislative session that he looks forward to signing such a measure into law.

House Bill 14, by Harris and sponsored in the Senate by Georgetown Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner, would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and the Advanced Nuclear Development Fund under the governor's office. The new agency and funding arm would assess the need for additional nuclear generation or explore ways to promote future plant construction.

The bill sets up guidelines and benchmarks for companies planning to develop nuclear plants to help meet Texas' seemingly insatiable appetite for electric power, and it makes available public financial assistance for both planning and constructing power plants.

""Advancements in nuclear energy offer a promising opportunity to strengthen our electric grid with reliable, dispatchable generation while supporting the growth of this innovative industry,"" Schwertner said as he explained the Senate version of HB 14.

Both chambers passed the bill with bipartisan support, though there was some skepticism expressed about the funding provisions.

Grants vs. loan to promote nuclear development

""Would it not make more sense to maybe do a revolving loan so that they (power companies) would pay them back and we could re-enter and save more money into the system and encourage more nuclear development?"" state Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, asked Schwertner.

The proposed grant system would be a more persuasive tool, Schwertner responded. Plus, he added, the legislation contains payback provisions if companies do not deliver what they promised.

""They do have risk,"" he said.

Under HB 14, the state Public Utility Commission will develop a framework to tie grant amounts to the amount of electric generation a project would produce.

Why Abbott wants a 'nuclear renaissance'

In his State of the State address shortly after the Legislature convened in January, Abbott called for a ""nuclear renaissance"" in Texas to ensure that the rapidly growing state can meet the demand for power that comes with not only adding to its population, but also attracting more commercial and industrial development.

Texas is home to two nuclear power plants, but both are aging. The Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant's first phase was completed in 1990 after several delays and setbacks since construction began in 1974. The second phase of the plant, which is about 60 miles southwest of Fort Worth, went online in 1993.

The South Texas Project in Matagorda County, about 90 miles south of Houston, began operations in 1988.

As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Illinois has 11 reactors, the most of any state. The nation's largest nuclear power source, the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, has four reactors. The average age of all U.S. nuclear plants is around 42.

What nuclear power projects are pending in Texas?

Reed Clay, president of the Texas Nuclear Alliance, called the legislation ""a giant leap forward for our state and our country."" He predicted it would revive an industry that ""was all but dead for decades.""

""With the passage of H.B. 14 and associated legislation, Texas is positioned to lead a nuclear renaissance that is now rightly seen as imperative for the energy security and national security of the United States,"" Clay said in a statement to the Statesman.

Meanwhile, Texas A&M University's research-focused RELLIS campus near the system's flagship institution is working to develop a nuclear generation project just a fraction of the size of traditional nuclear plants like those in Comanche Peak, and the South Texas Project. The university's permit is awaiting approval from the NRC. Also, Natura Resources is seeking federal approval for a nuclear plant in Abilene.

The first small modular reactor in Texas will be located on Dow's Seadrift plant just north of San Antonio Bay near Victoria. Dow is partnering with the company X-energy on the project that was bolstered by an initial $80 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department. The formal permit application was filed with the NRC in March.","https://www.statesman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/NAAS/83926071007-20250523-t-125100-z-2023065423-rc-2-alaaa-1-ie-1-rtrmadp-3-usastocksnuclearstocks.JPG?crop=5544,3119,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 18:08:31.313484

Pet policy provisions that House Republicans tucked into the megabill could get ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian for not meeting the Byrd Rule — the requirement that components of a reconciliation package have budgetary impacts.","By Lisa Kashinsky, Mia McCarthy and Ben Leonard

Chuck Schumer tells us Democrats have a ripe new target in their fight against the megabill: leveraging Republican infighting over whether to eviscerate clean-energy credits.

In an exclusive interview with Lisa Thursday, the Senate minority leader said his caucus is looking to make it politically untenable for Majority Leader John Thune and his members to follow House Republicans in gutting green credits under the Biden-era climate law. Those credits, Schumer points out, have widely benefited red states.

Schumer’s game plan: Needle Republicans already wary of job and investment losses back home to compel Thune to skip the drastic cuts that House GOP leaders included to bring hard-liners along.

How Senate Democrats will do it: Ramp up the public pressure campaign Schumer kick-started Thursday against the backdrop of a rooftop solar field in Manhattan, and force Republicans to take tough votes through eventual vote-a-rama amendments.

“There are a whole number of Republicans, particularly those that have a lot of clean-energy investments in their states, who really didn’t like what the House did,” Schumer told Lisa. “And the question is: Will they be able to put enough pressure on Thune, or even vote [with us] on some amendments?”

Why Schumer sees this as a fruitful avenue for attack: A quartet of GOP senators — Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, John Curtis and Jerry Moran — warned their leadership weeks ago against a “full-scale repeal of current credits.” Tillis has already raised concerns about the House language. Schumer said he’s spoken privately to “a good number of Republican colleagues” who dislike the House’s cuts, but declined to name names.

“The irony here is most of the new solar, wind and battery factories are in red states. And so we want to make it clear … [the rollbacks] are going to be huge problems in their states,” Schumer said.

Democrats may have an unlikely ally in this fight. Elon Musk’s Tesla on Thursday blasted plans to phase out the clean-energy tax credits and terminate most credits for electric vehicles at the end of the year, arguing it would “threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

But Republicans have a more pressing challenge awaiting in the Senate. Pet policy provisions that House Republicans tucked into the megabill could get ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian for not meeting the Byrd Rule — the requirement that components of a reconciliation package have budgetary impacts. And they could get cut in what’s known as a “Byrd Bath.”

The seven “Byrd droppings” to keep an eye on, per our Jordain Carney this morning: tax-cut accounting, AI regulations, judicial powers, gun regulations, farm bill provisions, Planned Parenthood funds and energy permitting.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

On Wednesday, Talon Metals Corp. signed a land-use agreement to build a $365 million processing facility at the former Westmoreland Beulah Mine, which closed in 2021.

The Beulah Mineral Processing Facility (BMPF) will handle nickel and copper — vital materials used in electric vehicle batteries, renewable energy systems, stainless steel and military technologies. Construction is expected to begin in 2027, with the aim of supporting national energy independence and revitalizing the local economy.

Talon Metals, a Minnesota-based company, plans to repurpose approximately 256 acres of the former coal mine site, citing the area’s existing infrastructure as a major advantage. The company will transport raw materials by rail from its proposed Tamarack mine in Minnesota — a joint venture with Rio Tinto — to Beulah via BNSF Railway.

“We have the infrastructure here,” said Beulah Mayor Sean Cheatley. “Everything’s there—they don’t have to do any more ground work. It’s going to bring more jobs to the area and bolster our economy.”

Talon estimates the project will create around 150 full-time jobs, with several hundred more expected during construction.

The BMPF is backed by a $115 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, awarded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Talon President Mike Kicis called the federal support “essential” to moving the project forward.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke at the announcement ceremony, praised the DOE for supporting North Dakota’s role in critical minerals development — despite having voted against the infrastructure law while serving in the U.S. House.

In a 2021 statement, Armstrong said, “We cannot continue to spend money we don’t have and saddle future generations with the consequences of reckless spending.”

Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer supported the Senate version of the bill and have voiced strong backing for the project.

“This is a priority project, nationally, in terms of manufacturing critical minerals instead of getting them from places like China and Russia,” Hoeven said. “So, this is a big deal — for the Hazen and Beulah area, for North Dakota and for our country.”

Although the Beulah facility has local support, its viability hinges on approval of the Tamarack mine in Minnesota, currently under environmental review by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.

The proposed mine has drawn opposition from Native American groups and environmental organizations concerned about its impact on wild rice habitats and water sources. Talon spokesperson Jessica Johnson said the company revised its mine design after receiving more than 1,600 public comments, opting for an underground structure with an enclosed entrance to reduce pollution and protect water quality.

“We’re very hopeful that it will go through,” Johnson said. “We’ve put a lot of effort into mine design to address environmental concerns brought to us.”

If the Tamarack mine is not approved, Talon says it is exploring other domestic sources for critical minerals, though Tamarack remains the “primary focus.”

At the Beulah site, Talon plans to use dry stacking — a method of dewatering and compacting mine tailings — to manage waste. Though considered safer than traditional slurry storage, dry stacking can still pose a risk of heavy metal leaching during rain or snowmelt. To address this, the company is researching the use of fly ash from local coal plants to chemically stabilize the tailings.

Johnson likened the stabilizing effect to “taking Tums for an upset stomach.”

Talon is also exploring a “Full Value Mining Scenario” that could include building a byproduct processing facility to extract cobalt, iron and other materials from tailings. This facility might also produce cement alternatives for road construction and carbon storage materials, though no budget or timeline has been set.

If both the BMPF and Tamarack mine are approved, construction on each could begin around the same time in 2027, with operations starting as early as 2028. The Beulah facility would help fulfill Talon’s contract to supply Tesla with 75,000 metric tons of nickel concentrate over six years.

“This is about more than just one plant,” said Johnson. “It’s about building a secure, sustainable supply chain for the technologies that are shaping our future.”

Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project’s environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That’s far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area’s geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda,” she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They’ve had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission’s permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state’s contested case process.

Public colleges are laying off scientists, canceling projects and turning away brilliant minds — not because we lack potential, but because Big Oil wants it that way.

Nuclear fission isn’t just another energy source — it’s a revolution. A single gram of uranium holds over a million times more energy than a gram of coal. Modern reactor designs are safer, smaller and can even run on spent fuel. Once operational, fission plants can provide uninterrupted, emissions-free electricity for decades at rock-bottom costs. No weather dependency. No supply chain chaos. Just pure, reliable energy — forever.

That’s exactly what the oil and gas lobby fears. If we crack fission wide open, their multi-trillion- dollar empire crumbles. So they do what they’ve always done: funnel cash to politicians, choke off federal research funding and gut science programs at the nation’s universities. The result? America’s best minds are being told to pack up and find something else to study — while China’s scientists build reactors that may one day power the world.

We’re not falling behind — we’re being dragged backward by greed. Every cut to higher education and nuclear research is another nail in the coffin of American energy independence and global leadership.

If we want to lead the future, we have to invest in it. Right now, we’re selling it off for one more tank of gas.

President Trump’s vision to unleash American energy and ensure U.S. global dominance can be realized by embracing the resilience of nuclear energy. Indeed, Mr. Trump can usher in America’s new economic, military and energy renaissance and forge a new era of American prosperity by embracing a new American nuclear future. He can make a strong case to his fellow citizens that there is no American dream without American atomic energy.

The ideal venue for President Trump to share his vision for “Energizing America” through nuclear energy should be from the deck of a nuclear-powered U.S. submarine. He can demonstrate the importance of and support for America’s nuclear renaissance by pointing out that America’s dominance of the global sea lanes has been made possible by nuclear energy, which ironically is also America’s largest source of clean energy. President Trump can argue that if the U.S. fails to lead in delivering nuclear technology, U.S. industries will struggle to compete, the U.S. economy will falter, and as a result, U.S. security at home and abroad will be severely weakened.

The good news is that there is bipartisan support in Congress to significantly expand America’s domestic capacity to generate reliable electricity, always on, and available without risk of outage. According to Senator Risch of Idaho, nuclear energy is the definitive solution to meet President Trump’s vision of making America great again. For example, as AI transforms our world, revolutionizes industries from health care to national security, and reshapes how we live and communicate, our dependence on electricity becomes critical.

Indeed, the race for AI dominance has launched a long-term stampede to connect to America’s vast electricity grid. Tech companies and data center providers need massive amounts of power as soon as possible. Trends suggest that by 2030, data centers for training AI models will require more than 5 gigawatts of electricity, which is about what Manhattan consumes on average. And beyond domestic AI needs, the US is locked into an existential struggle with China for AI supremacy. In short, America’s AI leadership will fall short if more nuclear energy isn’t developed.

President Trump can help accelerate his vision to “Energize America” by calling on the one company with the qualifications to immediately step up to the plate. Entra1 Energy is the exclusive commercialization partner of NuScale Power, the only technology provider and producer of small modular reactors (SMR) that has obtained U.S. nuclear regulatory approval and is ready for commercial deployment.

The advantages of the Entra1 Energy-NuScale alliance are fourfold. First, Entra1-NuScale has been certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), a process that can take at least 7 years.

In short, Nuscale is both deployable and can put power in the grid today. Second, NuScale can be deployed “behind the meter” and therefore, not pass on to consumers the higher costs of electricity needed to support America’s AI boom. This is important because at the current rate of total consumption, Americans can see a 70% increase in their electricity bills by 2030. Third, Entra1-NuScale can deploy its SMRs globally. As President Trump gets ready to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the U.A.E., he can also offer these countries, whose collective sovereign wealth exceeds $3 trillion, to consider companies such as Entra1-NuScale as their nuclear technology partner. And fourth, the Entra1-NuScale technology can help save lives. How? When a doctor is at an emergency room scanning the CT scans of millions of soldiers in hostile territory through 3D image recognition for wound assessment, he needs to ensure reliable and seamless access. Entra1-NuScale can provide this resilience and help save the lives of our brave men and women in uniform.

President Trump should take the following two steps to usher in a new era of American nuclear energy renewal. First, he should ask AI service providers such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Oracle to work with Nuscale to protect the American consumer but allow uninterrupted power to these leaders of America’s AI revolution. Second, Mr. Trump should instruct the Pentagon to sign with NuScale to provide reliable clean energy to bases inside and outside the US to stay ahead of China in the new race for AI dominance.

Specifically, the President can sign an Executive Order to direct the U.S. Air Force to start now (2025) to purchase power for 5 gigawatts from new SMR projects in the US to protect and grow the nation’s defense data centers and military drones/AI centers. For his Executive Order to be immediately actionable, he can state that the USAF utilize a Gen 3plus SMR technology that is: a) USNRC approved; b) uses readily available conventional fuel that is low-enriched; and c) SMRs deployable now with existing manufacturing facilities and supply chain capabilities. In practical terms, there is a direct connection between an Entra1-NuScale SMR and an MQ9 drone that is flying on enemy territory, taking millions of images for analysis by the US Air Force that cannot be interrupted because of lack of power or sabotage by Iranian, Russian or Chinese hackers.

By helping “Energize America” through nuclear energy, President Trump will ensure America’s long-term economic prosperity.

And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.
For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board.
Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories.
Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.","In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.

The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”

The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.

Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.

Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.

The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”

Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.

The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.

Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.

Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.

Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.

Lawmakers also cut out provisions from an earlier version of HB 15 that would have allowed community solar development. Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.",https://d2j02ha532z66v.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/February-2024-Great-Lakes-Learning-Lesson-2402.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 18:08:41.804650

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.
Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.
The Biden DOE had approved the $375 million Eastman funding in March 2024, using money from two laws passed in his presidency, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.
The pullback of Eastman funding comes less than two months after another large plastics recycling project that had received $182 million in Biden DOE funding, an International Recycling Group project in Erie, Pa., canceled its own plans.","President Donald Trump's administration canceled a $375 million federal investment on May 30 for an Eastman Chemical Co. chemical recycling facility planned for Longview, Texas.

The halt in federal funding for the $1.2 billion Eastman project was part of a larger Department of Energy announcement canceling DOE grants for 24 renewable energy and decarbonization projects worth a total of $3.7 billion.

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.

Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.

On an April 25 earnings call, however, Eastman Chairman and CEO Mark Costa struck an optimistic tone, saying that “we're not getting an indication that the project is at risk.”

“We feel very good about where we are with the DOE,” he said. “They have been highly engaged with us. We think that we've got a good relationship there, and we think that our project actually holds up well in the way President Trump thinks about U.S. manufacturing.”

He said the Longview project fits U.S. security interests in onshoring manufacturing.

“It's also a national security way to make raw materials for food packaging, medical, et cetera,” Costa said. “It's onshoring jobs from Asia because most of all the PET business has now gone to China.”

The Longview plant would use a depolymerization technology to take plastic waste feedstock and produce virgin-quality materials for packaging and textiles.

When it was announced, Eastman said it would have capacity to process about 240 million pounds of plastic waste annually. The company's first molecular recycling plant is at its Kingsport, Tenn., headquarters.

A DOE news release did not name all 24 facilities and department officials did not respond to emails and a phone call for comment, but both the Longview News Journal and the online government-oriented news site NOTUS reported that Eastman's project was among those losing funding.

The Biden DOE had approved the $375 million Eastman funding in March 2024, using money from two laws passed in his presidency, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But in the Trump administration's May 30 announcement, the DOE said the projects would not ""advance the energy needs"" of the U.S., were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment on tax dollars.

""While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" DOE Secretary Chris Wright said. ""Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.""

The DOE said that federal funding for 16 of the 24 projects was approved between Trump's election day victory in November and when he took office on Jan. 20, and primarily included funding for carbon capture and storage, and decarbonization initiatives.

A Washington-based clean energy research organization, however, said the cuts in what's known as the Industrial Demonstrations Program would ultimately hurt U.S. competitiveness.

""The Industrial Demonstrations Program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration's goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,"" the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said. ""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness.""

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.
Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration.
In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to a memorandum he issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

American Cast Iron Pipe Company (metal manufacturing): $75 million

Brimstone Energy (low-carbon materials): $189 million

Calpine’s Baytown Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Calpine’s Sutter Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Eastman Chemical Company’s Longview Plant (molecular plastic recycling): $375 million

Exxon Mobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant (chemical plant): $331.9 million

Skyven Technologies (heat pump steam generation): $15.3 million

Sublime Systems (low carbon cement): $86.9 million

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email.

“As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added.

The $125,000 grant would fund a framework for early site permitting for nuclear technology, which could be used by other municipal utilities.

The study will assess the suitability of Lakeland Electric's land for different types of nuclear power plants, but doesn't require the utility to build one.

For more than a decade, the idea of Lakeland Electric purchasing or producing nuclear power to provide electricity to customers has been talked about.

Now the city's taking a small step that could make that a reality in the future.

Lakeland commissioners will vote June 2 on whether to accept a $125,000 Demonstration of Energy and Efficiency Developments grant from the American Public Power Association. With the funding, Lakeland Electric would develop a framework for an early site permitting process that other municipal utilities could follow for nuclear technology.

""We want to make sure Lakeland Electric is flexible enough if nuclear technology grows up and if we get to a point where Lakeland choses to go nuclear, we are able to do so,"" said Mike Dammer, LE's manager of emerging technology. ""Why start the process in 15 years if we can do part of the work now?""

With the funds, Dammer said Lakeland Electric will receive the APPA's assistance from experienced nuclear professionals in evaluating the utility's land sites and conducting environmental studies to determine their suitability as future locations for different kinds of nuclear power plants and technology.

""Many of the APPA member utilities are in the same boat we're in: We have no nuclear knowledge, with no nuclear background but are interested in nuclear going forward,"" he said.

Building on research by the national nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, Deputy City Attorney Ramona Sirianni said the goal is to come up with a framework and set of procedures, or ""playbook,"" that municipal-owned utilities across the country can follow to get permits to build nuclear power plants.

The grant does not require Lakeland Electric to commit to building a nuclear power plant.

""We are not building a nuclear power plant as of right now,"" Dammer said. ""Getting an early site permit does not require you to build a [power] plant. It gives us the option to do so in the future.""

In 2020, Joel Ivy, Lakeland Electric's prior general manager, said he thought Lakeland Electric would make a major investment into nuclear energy if technology continued to advance over the next 10 to 15 years, with small modular nuclear reactors becoming more refined.

Commissioner Stephanie Madden has publicly spoken enthusiastically about the advancements in small modular nuclear reactors, sometimes called SMRs, as a future possibility.

""We could go into this study and find out that our site is just not suited for nuclear, that’s a very real possibility as well,"" Dammer said. ""We want to know what are our options.""

If city officials accept the grant, Lakeland Electric will have through April 1 to complete all necessary studies and work.

Even if Lakeland Electric's sites are found to not be well suited for nuclear, Dammer said the environmental studies performed can help the utility decide what might be the best use moving forward.

When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, it was heralded as the most ambitious climate and industrial policy in decades. While its headline focused on clean energy and emissions reduction, the law is also proving to be a massive economic catalyst for historically overlooked regions, especially in Appalachia. From battery manufacturing in Pennsylvania to steel upgrades in Ohio and hydroelectric projects in Kentucky, federal investments are flowing into working-class communities that had long been dismissed as left behind. This is not just climate policy, it’s economic reinvestment, job creation, and community revitalization. Need more insight?

The GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions and energy use in technologies) model was first developed by Argonne National Laboratory in 1994. The tool is designed to access the life cycle impacts of technologies, fuels, products and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. The agency has since developed multiple GREET models designed for specific use cases.

The DOE in January 2025 released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is specifically designed to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

The agency has now updated the 45ZCF-GREET model, noting the changes “will allow a wider range of farmers and companies to do business in America’s thriving alternative fuels market.”

Information released by the DOE outlines eight specific changes the agency has made to 45ZCF-GREET. The changes include:

Added pathway for ethanol from U.S. corn wet mills. A simplified plant-level allocation by mass is applied to derive the results for ethanol. The same indirect emissions value per MJ for dry mill corn ethanol is applied to wet mill ethanol.

Revised Methanol input for biodiesel production to be entered in gallons as opposed to units of energy (MMBtu).

Added coal as a process input option for biodiesel via Transesterification pathways.

Clarifies in the GREET User Manual that Carbon capture utilization and sequestration (CCUS) allows CO₂ stored in U.S. Class II wells used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in addition to Class VI wells. (Note: No changes to model only revisions to user manual.)

Corrected Summary Table 9b. in the GREET User Manual to reflect final Indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions factors for soy and canola. (Note: No changes to model or modeled results, only correcting summary data as presented in the manual.)

Added pathway for alternative natural gas from coal mine methane (CMM) capture and upgrading.

Lifecycle emissions results updated to include the output in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent per million British thermal units (kg CO₂e/MMBtu), consistent with Section 45Z tax credit.

Added text to the GREET User Manual to quote Notice 2025-11, sec. 401 to clarify that these (and potential future) model updates, including new types, categories or pathways, may be used immediately.

“The Trump administration is committed to helping American fuel producers make the most of our country’s abundant biomass resources,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Lou Hrkman. “The latest version of the 45ZCF-GREET model will allow more of our farmers to reap the benefits of a rapidly expanding market for alternative transportation fuels.”

Growth Energy is welcoming the new guidance, noting it will create jobs and unleash new investments. “By lifting needless restrictions on wet mills and different end uses for captured carbon, the updated user manual ensures that more farmers and biofuel producers will have the freedom and flexibility to invest in U.S. energy dominance while supporting stronger markets for American agriculture,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “In conjunction with an extension of the credit under consideration by lawmakers, this guidance will help restore market certainty and increase American competitiveness in the race for the next generation of liquid fuel solutions. We applaud Energy Secretary Wright for working with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to deliver a fairer, more accurate model for calculating incentives that will help drive American energy dominance and spur economic growth.”

More broadly, as we reported last November, Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda was linked to $988 billion in private sector investments.
However, Donald Trump does not want the country or the world transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy and electric vehicles, and policy changes Republicans are moving through Congress put that preference onto paper, with disastrous results.

“Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a great stimulus for new clean energy projects, EV factories, battery factories, etc. It led to massive new investments, reshoring of countless blue collar jobs, and a more vibrant economy for the fast-growing industries of the future.

More broadly, as we reported last November, Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda was linked to $988 billion in private sector investments.

However, Donald Trump does not want the country or the world transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy and electric vehicles, and policy changes Republicans are moving through Congress put that preference onto paper, with disastrous results.

According to a new analysis from the nonpartisan organization E2, so far this year, businesses have “cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in clean energy and clean vehicle factories” due to concerns about policy changes and especially removal of key tax credits. So much for being businesses friendly and supporting manufacturing in the United States.

Just in April, as talk of repealing clean energy policies heated up (not to mention the tariffs), $4.5 billion in investments in EV, wind power, and battery projects were cancelled. E2 notes that this is “in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits.”

In other words, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is going to cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of private sector investment in the US.

Ironically, it’s Republican-controlled districts that are being the most hurt by this. “Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.” Yet again, we have a case of Republican politicians doing things that hurt Republican voters — but all the politicians have to do is keep them scared and enraged about things that don’t really harm them and the rest is ignored or forgiven.

“Through April, over 61 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments—are in congressional districts represented by Republicans,” E2 adds.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake commented.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

One can dream, but “counting on Congress to come to its senses” doesn’t seem advisable.

The good news is that so many projects were stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act and other Investing in America policies that some of them will continue on anyway. Also, frankly, these are growing industries and that’s going to continue to be the case for years to come. “While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy,” E2 writes. “Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states – including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Solar-Power-Battery-Energy-Storage-CleanTechnica-Watermark.png,N,,2025-05-30 17:07:39.670560

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" could bar tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology, impacting Ford's incoming Marshall plant that would be making battery cells using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL.

""The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,"" Ford Motor Company Executive Chair Bill Ford said.

BlueOval:

At a conference on Mackinac Island Thursday, Ford said the disappearance of tax credits for EV batteries will threaten their investment in the Marshall plant.

""We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place, it's not fair to change policies after all the expenditures have been made,"" Ford said. ""If it really doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall.""

This comes amid other challenges the company has faced since building the battery park.

In 2024, Ford cut funding for the project. The state then scaled back their own investment from $210 million to $141 million, blaming a ""turbulent EV market.""

Once complete, BlueOval Battery Park is expected to create 1,700 local jobs when production of batteries for electric vehicles begins in 2026.

Ford believes the federal funding cuts put these jobs in jeopardy.

""We actually don't think it's fair to have offered all those jobs, about to open [the park] and then say, 'sorry, we're changing the policy,'"" Ford said. ""So I'm spending a lot of time, you know, talking about that with politicians.""

Lounds is one of over 100 local entities who have in support of keeping the tax credits and continuing the investment in the plant.

""Marshall is a great community, and this would be something that would really help solidify us moving forward,"" Lounds said.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" has to be passed by the U.S. Senate before heading to President Trump's desk.

,Kentucky American Energy ,2025-05-30 19:47:00+00:00,Canary Media,Trump admin cuts $3.7B for industrial decarbonization and carbon capture - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced,"But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.
The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world.
That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods.
Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana.
The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.","The Department of Energy announced Friday that it is canceling over $3.7 billion in funding for projects that would cut carbon emissions and toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial sites, ranging from cement kilns to ketchup-processing plants.

The DOE shared a list of the projects to be cut with Canary Media on Friday, which showed that more than half of the awards under the ambitious Industrial Demonstrations Program, housed under the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, will be terminated. OCED funding focused on carbon capture at gas-fired power plants is also impacted.

DOE claimed the projects ​“failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But advocates disagree. Not only would the projects kickstart efforts to clean up industries that are notoriously tricky to decarbonize — they would have generated serious economic benefits, too.

Analyses from groups including the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy have found that federal spending from OCED would have created hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and helped position U.S. industries to compete in international markets that are increasingly demanding cleaner materials and products.

Stakeholders have for months expected the Trump administration to cut the OCED awards, which were authorized under the Biden administration by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In March and April, reports surfaced of plans by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate the office’s $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program, cut carbon capture and sequestration projects, and cancel billions of dollars of funding for clean-hydrogen hubs based in Democratic-leaning states.

Today’s announcement doesn’t include any hydrogen-hub funding cuts. But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.

The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world. That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods. Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana. And the National Cement Company of California won’t receive its $500 million grant to take a multi-technology approach to cutting emissions from its plant in Lebec, California.

The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.

Kraft Heinz will lose its $170 million award to install clean heat technologies at 10 of its food production facilities. Beverage giant Diageo North America will no longer receive the $75 million it was promised to help install thermal energy storage systems from startup Rondo Energy at production facilities in Kentucky and Illinois. And Texas-based industrial heat pump manufacturer Skyven Technologies, which had been awarded a $145 million grant to install its technology at a New York state ethanol plant, was listed on DOE’s spreadsheet as having a $15 million grant rescinded. (DOE did not immediately respond to inquiries to determine whether Skyven was set to lose only part of its $145 million grant or if DOE’s spreadsheet was in error.)

Projects to cut pollution from factories that make metals are also on the chopping block. That includes a $75 million grant to back American Cast Iron Pipe Co.’s ​“Next Gen Melt Project,” which would have lowered emissions from iron and steelmaking at its site in Birmingham, Alabama. It also includes $75 million for United States Pipe and Foundry Co. to replace a coal-fired furnace with electric arc furnaces.

The DOE’s cancellations will also impact several projects seeking to reduce carbon emissions from glass production, including $75 million for Gallo Glass in Modesto, California; $57 million for Owens-Brockway Glass Container in Zanesville, Ohio; and $45 million for Libbey Glass in Toledo, Ohio.

Friday’s list also includes projects to cut carbon emissions from chemicals production, including $100 million for Ørsted to capture and use industrial carbon dioxide waste to make shipping fuel at its Star e-Methanol facility in Texas; $375 million for Eastman Chemical Co.’s plastics recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $331 million for Exxon Mobil to use hydrogen instead of fossil gas for ethylene production in Baytown, Texas.

Funding for carbon capture and storage projects at power plants will be scrapped, too. Calpine will not receive a pair of $270 million awards to retrofit power plants in Texas and California.

The list did not include some high-profile metals decarbonization projects, like the $575 million in grants set to flow to two Cleveland-Cliffs steel facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio — the latter in Middletown, Vice President JD Vance’s hometown — or the $500 million for Century Aluminum to build a ​“green smelter,” likely in Kentucky.

What remains unclear is the extent to which Friday’s cancellations have disrupted ongoing construction, hiring of workers, or other unrecoverable commitments from companies impacted. Firms have been tight-lipped about plans to navigate the consequences of federal funding clawbacks. All of the awards required participating companies to invest at least as much as they were set to receive in federal grants.

A representative of Sublime Systems told Canary Media that the company was ​“surprised and disappointed” by DOE’s decision to cut its grant. Sublime this week announced a deal with Microsoft, which said it would buy 600,000 tons of the low-carbon cement to be produced from the startup’s first commercial-scale plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts — a plant backed by DOE’s grant.

“It is our hope to continue to partner with the DOE to show a success story of American innovation and ingenuity at its finest,” Sublime’s representative said in a Friday email. ​“Nevertheless, we have prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome and are evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

The projects are without a doubt now on far shakier financial footing, and advocates do not expect that they’ll be able to move forward without the federal funding. Should they fail, the effects would be profound, according to Evan Gillespie, a partner at advocacy group Industrious Labs.

“[The projects] would have helped catapult the U.S. into a leadership position in the technologies that will bring down emissions and pace the next generation of industrial evolution,” he said. ​“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas industry executive who insists that climate change is not a crisis, said in Friday’s announcement that the decision would benefit U.S. taxpayers.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Industrial decarbonization advocates pushed back.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a Friday statement. ​“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret. Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213269576.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fe009fbf92252e9a29b1f3e443e57600,N,,2025-05-30 18:09:17.036675

There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.
In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits: Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits Current Law.
The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets.
Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.","On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Act). The Act includes an accelerated repeal schedule of significant renewable energy tax credits and more restrictive amendments than those initially introduced in the House Ways and Means Committee’s proposed bill (Bill), which was approved by the Ways and Means Committee on May 14, 2025.

As described more fully below, among the changes proposed to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA)1, the Act includes the following:

repeal of the technology-neutral tax credits (i.e., Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y PTC) and Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit (48E ITC)) for projects (i) on which construction begins more than 60 days following the date of the Act’s enactment or (ii) that are placed in service after 2028 (without regard to when construction begins)

acceleration, or provision for, the phaseout of most other energy credits

repeal of the credit transferability provision starting (i) two years after enactment of the Act, for the 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, or (ii) in 2028, for the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and the Section 45Z tax credits Clean Fuel Production Credit

introduction of restrictions and limitations for claiming energy credits by adding foreign entity of concern (FEOC) related provisions starting in 2026

Key Takeaways

If enacted, the Act will significantly affect the renewable energy industry and adversely affect the ability to develop and finance various renewable energy projects.

The new FEOC-related restrictions may cause taxpayers and projects that would otherwise be eligible for such tax credits to lose their eligibility due to ownership and supply-chain issues. Accordingly, the inclusion of the FEOC-related provisions and their broad application will need to be carefully analyzed and discussed in connection with existing and future commercial arrangements.

The Act generally does not affect energy projects that began construction by the end of 2024 and are eligible for tax credits pursuant to Section 48 (Section 48 ITC) and Section 45 (Section 45 PTC). The Act also does not directly change the domestic content or energy community adders, although those adders would be subject to accelerated phaseout (or repeal) in the same manner as the base credits. There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.

The Act now moves to the Senate for continuing debates and negotiations. Numerous Senate Republicans stated that they will have additional changes to the Act and voiced objections to the accelerated phaseout of certain energy credits.

Changes to Existing Energy Credit Provisions

Section 48E / Section 45Y — Zero Emission / Clean Electricity ITCs and PTCs

Current Law. For projects beginning construction after 2024, the IRA replaced the Section 45 PTC and Section 48 ITC with corresponding “technology neutral” credits: the Section 45Y PTC and the Section 48E ITC. Each of these credits is currently subject to a phaseout starting in 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions).

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC for any qualified facility that (i) begins construction more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Act or (ii) that is placed in service after December 31, 2028. Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2029, remain eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC. This differs from the proposal in the Bill that provided an accelerated phaseout of the credits tied to the year in which the project is placed in service (rather than the year in which construction begins).

Key Takeaways. The proposed elimination of the phaseout schedule and the repeal of these credits for projects that either did not begin construction by the end of the 60-day period following the enactment of the Act or will not be placed in service before 2029 is significant and will adversely affect wind, solar, battery storage, and other renewable energy projects.

Under current law, the full credit amount would be available for projects that begin construction prior to 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions). Under existing Internal Revenue Service “beginning-of-construction” guidance, a project satisfying the “physical work test” or “5% safe harbor” in a particular year will be treated as beginning construction in that year so long as it is placed in service during the four years following that year. Accordingly, under current law, projects beginning construction in 2033 would be eligible for the full credit amount so long as they are placed in service before 2038.

If the Act is enacted in its current form, taxpayers that have not yet begun construction on projects intended to qualify for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC will need to evaluate their current construction schedules and consider strategies for satisfying the beginning of construction requirement during the 60-day period following the Act’s enactment. In this regard, while it seems reasonable to assume that the same beginning-of-construction rules that have historically applied in the context of renewable energy projects (i.e., the “physical work test” and the “5% safe harbor”) will apply for these purposes, this is a point that may require confirmation from the Department of the Treasury.

Section 45Q — Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Current Law. Section 45Q entitles taxpayers who (i) own carbon capture equipment used to capture qualified carbon oxide from an industrial facility or from the atmosphere and (ii) physically or contractually sequester or use it for certain purposes as provided by Section 45Q to a credit for each metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured and sequestered or used during the 12-year period starting on the date the equipment is first placed in service. Taxpayers may claim the Section 45Q credit if construction on a qualified facility begins before January 1, 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act does not accelerate the expiration of the Section 45Q credit, nor does the Act introduce a phaseout concept applicable to the credit. However, the proposal to repeal the transferability of the tax credits, pursuant to Section 6418, and the new foreign entity of concern provisions (both explained in greater detail in separate sections below) apply to the credit.

Section 45U — Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45U, which provides a two-tier credit, adjusted for inflation, per kWh of electricity produced at a qualified nuclear facility and sold to an unrelated party after 2023 and before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for the Section 45U Zero Emission Nuclear Power PTC based on the year in which the project is placed in service, as follows:

Section 45V — Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45V, which provides a two-tier, inflation-adjusted, 10-year PTC for clean hydrogen produced after 2022 at a qualified facility, the construction of which begins before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit effective for projects on which construction commences after December 31, 2025, which is seven years earlier than the sunset date under the IRA.

Section 45X — Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45X, which provides tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party. The Section 45X credit amount varies depending on the eligible component. The Section 45X credit begins phasing out in 2030 and is not available for components sold after 2032.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45X credits for wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The Act further proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for all other eligible components, as follows:

Section 45Z — Clean Fuel Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45Z, which provides a clean fuel production tax credit for taxpayers who produce and sell qualifying transportation fuel to an unrelated party before January 1, 2028, with the credit amount determined, in part, by reference to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions rate. Among other requirements, the fuel must be produced in the United States for the taxpayer to be eligible for the Section 45Z credit.

Proposed Changes. In contrast to most of the other energy credits, the Act proposes to extend the period this credit can be claimed by four years, until December 31, 2031, but proposes changes to the eligibility requirements and calculation of the credit.

The Act proposes to limit the availability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel sold after December 31, 2025, to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada rather than solely requiring that the fuel be produced in the United States.

The Act also makes two changes to how the emissions rate used in determining the credit amount is calculated. First, the Act provides that the amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use change. Second, with respect to any transportation fuel derived from animal manure, a distinct emissions rate shall be provided with respect to each of the specific feedstocks used to such produce such fuel (i.e., dairy manure, swine manure, poultry manure, and such other sources determined by the Secretary of the Treasury).

Termination of Other Energy Credits

Proposed Changes. In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits:

Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits

Current Law. The IRA added Section 6418 to the Code, which allows eligible taxpayers to transfer all or a portion of their eligible credits for cash, to a taxpayer that is not related to the transferor taxpayer (within the meaning of Section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)). The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets. Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to repeal the transferability provisions with respect to various credits. The chart below lists the affected credits and the effective date of the repeal of their transferability.

Key Takeaways. The proposed repeal of the transferability of the various tax credits is likely to have a material impact on the development and financing of various projects. This alternative method of monetizing the various tax credits had a positive impact on the market since the enactment of the IRA and assisted developers with financing their projects. During taxable year 2024, it is estimated that tax credits in excess of $25 billion were sold pursuant to these rules. Repealing this monetization alternative will require developers and sponsors to rely mainly on the tax equity financing, which was a market historically capped at approximately $20 billion. This may adversely affect the number of projects developed.

There are no changes to the transferability rules for projects eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or Section 48E ITC (contrary to the suggested repeal of these transferability rules as initially proposed in the Bill). However, this should not provide significant comfort to developers of wind, solar, battery storage, and other technologies generally eligible for such tax credits due to the general accelerated repeal of these credits, as discussed above.

Newly Proposed Energy Credit Provisions/Restrictions

In addition to the repeals and accelerated phaseout schedules for existing energy credit provisions, the Act introduces complex restrictions relating to certain relationships with “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs). These restrictions broaden the category of restricted foreign entities from the Department of Energy’s interpretation of FEOC to the more expansive category of PFEs.

These rules apply to most energy credits, including (as applicable) the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, Section 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power PTC, and Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing PTC.

In general, these restrictions are divided into two sets of restrictions. The first set includes restrictions related to projects owned by a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs. The second set includes restrictions related to projects in which SFEs or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs provide material assistance in connection with the design, construction, or operation of the project.

Ownership-Related Restrictions

Starting in 2026, no tax credit is allowed if a project is owned by an SFE. An SFE is generally an entity that is either (i) identified by reference to an enumerated list of authorities as a threat to the security of the United States or (ii) a “foreign-controlled entity.” A domestic entity will be an SFE only if it is a “foreign-controlled entity,” which generally requires more than 50% ownership by entities with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran.4

The ownership rules become more restrictive starting two years after enactment of the Act. At that time, no credit will be allowed if the entity that owns the project is a “foreign-controlled entity” or is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

The definition of a “foreign-influenced entity” is much broader than the definition of a foreign-controlled entity. An entity will be treated as a “foreign-influenced entity” during a taxable year if

- an SFE (including foreign-controlled entities and entities otherwise identified as SFEs) has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or person with similar powers

- a single SFE has an ownership interest of 10% or more

- multiple SFEs hold, in the aggregate, ownership interests of 25% or more

- one or more SFEs hold 25% or more of the entity’s outstanding debt

- payments of certain fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic payments (e.g., dividends, interests, royalites, rents, service fees) (FDAP Payments) knowingly made to a single SFE exceed 10% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

- FDAP payments knowingly made to one or more SFEs exceed 25% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

Project/Facility-Level Restrictions

In addition to the ownership restrictions, a project will not be eligible for the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, or Section 45X credit if the construction of the project (or production of components in the case of Section 45X) begins following December 31, 2025 (or two years in the case of the Section 45X credit), and such construction (or production of components) includes “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., an SFE or foreign-influenced entity).

The term “material assistance” means, with respect to any property,

(i) any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X(c)(6)) included in such property that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity

(ii) any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity

“Material assistance” does not include any assembly part, subcomponent, or constituent material provided that such part or material is not (i) exclusively or predominantly produced by PFE, (ii) acquired directly from a PFE, and (iii) uniquely designed for use in construction of a Section 48E ITC or Section 45Y PTC facility or a Section 45X eligible component.5

In addition to the foregoing, for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years following the date of enactment of the Act, the existence of FDAP Payments made to one or more PFEs during that taxable year would also lead to the ineligibility for such tax credits, if such payments are made

- to a single PFE in an amount equal to or greater than 5% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year or

- to multiple PFEs in an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year.

In the case of Section 48E ITC, the violation of these FDAP Payments rules during the 10-year period following the date the applicable project was placed in service will trigger a 100% recapture of the Section 48E ITC previously claimed.

Section 45X Related Restrictions

In addition to the general ownership and components related restrictions above, there are certain other operational restrictions that could prevent manufacturers from claiming the Section 45X tax credits.

Starting two years after the enactment of the Act, no Section 45X credits will be allowed if the production of certain applicable components is made with “material assistance” from a PFE. In addition to the definition above, “material assistance” for purposes of Section 45X will also be found if

- any design of the component is based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE, or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a PFE, or

- such component is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE with value exceeding $1 million.

Key Takeaways

The imposition of the new FEOC-related restrictions and the broad definitions of the related terms introduce significant complexity to the planning and analysis related to the eligibility of projects for the applicable tax credits. This together with the relatively short transition period included in the Act will require market participants to quickly reevaluate and potentially restructure their ownership and relevant supply chain and related commercial arrangements to mitigate the related risks if the Act will be enacted without changes.

The Act will now be reviewed and negotiated in the Senate, and further revisions to some of these rules are likely. We will continue to monitor this process and provide updates.

Timothy Male is the executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Policy Innovation Center.","In the clash between the competing pro-petroleum and pro-climate visions of the economy, few policy issues are as misunderstood and complicated as our nation’s environmental permitting systems.

The number of permitting actions is enormous.

During a single presidential term, approximately 1.5 million permitting, informal review, and consultation processes are overseen under just five environmental and historic preservation laws. Many of these cover minor actions that would never have required permits in the 1970s and 1980s.

Consider the National Environmental Policy Act. Roughly 400,000 “categorical exclusions” are processed under this law each presidential term, compared to about 1,000 major reviews called “environmental impact statements.” An exclusion isn’t an absence of review; instead, it is akin to a simpler kind of permit. There are categorical exclusions to cover summer picnics by federal agencies, a 90- to 120-day exclusion process for a loan to replace powerlines across North Dakota wheat fields, or exclusions for every Agriculture Department grant to a farmer. Most exclusions involve minimal staff hours and are completed in weeks to months, making it hard to object to any one review. But collectively, their issuance requires hundreds of staff and millions of days of project delays.

Over four years, about a million similar, small permit processes will run their course under the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and especially the National Historic Preservation Act.

Yet almost all the attention on reform has focused on the small number of “big” permits.

For example, President Biden’s permitting team reported cutting 25 percent off the average processing time for those 1,000 major environmental impact statements, compared to the first Trump administration, whose permits were also faster than the administration of Obama.

On big permits, Democratic administrations have favored adding staff to write and review documents. That strategy works, but it can be hard to maintain, particularly if agency budgets get cut. And most of the laborious steps to finish an impact statement remained unchanged, with some becoming more expansive.

Republicans tend to favor the wholesale elimination of major permits — at least for fossil fuel infrastructure — and cutting staff. That pattern showed up across President Trump’s executive orders. If maintained by courts and Congress, those orders would eliminate some National Environmental Policy Act regulations and skip most requirements to protect clean water and endangered wildlife by calling permit issuance an emergency. Democrats are increasingly flirting with exemptions for different categories of projects — wind and solar instead of oil and gas, for example.

A problem with taking away major permits is that they often have very significant impacts on things that communities in both red and blue states value. Permit reviews can produce much less harmful outcomes.

Addressing the millions of smaller permits is a missed opportunity with fewer downsides.

First, we should entirely eliminate thousands of small permits by defining the actions they cover as not “major federal actions” — the original, intended scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. For instance, a provision in proposed permitting legislation redefines all grants and loans this way. This change would benefit thousands of towns, cities, nonprofits and businesses that receive federal funding and wouldn’t affect public input because few categorical exclusions ever involve the public in the first place.

Second, we can improve remaining small permit processes by expanding reforms that have proven successful in dramatically accelerating timelines and reducing workload while still avoiding or compensating for harms caused by projects.

For example, government agencies are increasingly using technology-based ‘dashboards’ that allow anyone to track the status of an application and exactly which staff are reviewing it. Virginia has achieved the greatest success with this technology, alongside procedural reforms, delivering an expected 70 percent reduction in application review times for 200,000 state decisions over four years. The Department of Energy is piloting AI technologies that could allow more than 80 percent of small permit documents to be machine written.

Self-permitting under general permits is another promising reform. Projects that agree to use what are effectively common-sense best practices to avoid harm are automatically approved if they submit the paperwork that proves those practices will be followed. General permits exist under clean water and wildlife laws, although the paperwork required to get these automatic approvals could still be significantly reduced.

Offsets — which are opportunities to compensate for unavoidable environmental impacts — also help. Having a supply of pre-approved beneficial offsets has sped up some Clean Water Act permitting by 50 percent. We can’t build everything Americans want without having any environmental effect, and having offsets available allows unavoidable harm to be balanced with benefits to similar environmental features nearby.

The most important change needed to improve or eliminate millions of small procedures is a culture shift among both permitting agencies and permit applicants. Many government staff are dedicated public servants, but some view institutional caution as a mission and environmental permitting as a battleground instead of an opportunity to problem-solve with constituents.

On the other side, many applicants blame agencies when they themselves have submitted flawed or incomplete applications, proposed unreasonable projects, or rejected the idea of regulatory oversight, failing to respect the reality that most Americans want to unlock growth while also stewarding the environment.

Making a million small processes more agile, responsive and effective is a key step toward a government that strikes these balances, and that serves the needs of all Americans.

Designed for narrow streets, the one-seater EV has garnered significant pre-orders, potentially surpassing Toyota's EV sales in Japan. Priced at ¥1 million, the mibot targets rural areas and aims to address skepticism towards EVs with its minimalist design and low production costs.

A Japanese startup, KG Motors, is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV called the mibot, according to Bloomberg. Resembling a futuristic golf cart, the mibot is designed for Japan's narrow streets and has already pre-sold over half of the 3,300 units planned for delivery in 2027. This puts KG Motors on track to surpass Toyota, which sold around 2,000 EVs in Japan in 2024. This reportedly puts KG Motors on track to sell more EVs in Japan than the world’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., which shifted around such 2,000 vehicles in all of 2024. In a country where EVs are still a rare sight, KG Motors is trying to bust a burgeoning myth: That Bigger is Better. “Cars are simply too big,” said Kazunari Kusunoki, KG Motors’ founder and CEO, as quoted by Bloomberg. The mibot, priced at ¥1 million ($7,000) before tax, is half the cost of Japan’s popular Nissan Sakura EV. It offers a 100-kilometer range, a five-hour charge time, and a top speed of 60 km/h. Production is set to begin in October at a new factory east of Hiroshima. Japan’s EV market lags globally, with EVs making up just 3.5% of vehicle sales in 2023 compared to the global average of 18%, per BloombergNEF. Toyota’s multi-pathway approach, favoring hybrids alongside EVs, has shaped public skepticism about EVs’ popularity, Kusunoki noted. However, small kei cars like the Sakura, which sold nearly 23,000 units in 2024, dominate Japan’s EV market. KG Motors’ mibot, with its minimalist design and low production costs, targets rural areas with declining public transport. Bloomberg reports that 95% of the 2,250 pre-orders come from homeowners with at least one vehicle. The startup expects to break even on its second batch of 3,000 units and aims to produce 10,000 annually thereafter.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas.
With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.
“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”","The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday canceled more than $1 billion in clean energy funding for Texas as part of a continuing effort to reduce federal spending.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Among the canceled awards is a $331.9 million grant to ExxonMobil to replace natural gas with hydrogen at its Baytown Olefins Plant — a move that was expected to cut the facility’s emissions by more than half. Also canceled were a $270 million grant to Calpine for a carbon-capture facility in Baytown, a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical for a molecular recycling project in Longview, and a $99 million grant to Orsted for a clean methanol initiative along the Gulf Coast.

A spokesperson for ExxonMobil declined to comment on Friday. Calpine, Eastman Chemical and Orsted didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas. With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.

According to Energy Secretary Wright, the decision is expected to generate “an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.” Critics, however, argue the cancellations threaten the country’s energy innovation and manufacturing future.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3d6b80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5551x2914+0+393/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F3c%2Feba0b2c84e2ba148f5a296dddc24%2Fpower-plant-weatherization-tour-51629999110-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 16:09:38.611765

Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions back to the source of pollution.

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs) generally work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported material compared to the same material produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The Clean Competition Act (3422/H.R.6622) from the 118th Congress and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325), which was reintroduced in April 2025, both aim to set a price on carbon-intensive imported products.

The shift to domestic production, which would likely be spurred by a CBAM-like policy, could create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually, according to Third Way.

Greenhouse gas emissions come with a real and substantial price tag, whether from rising sea levels, increased healthcare costs in heavily industrialized communities, or crop damage. Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions from society back to the source of pollution. With a carbon price, often set per ton of carbon dioxide emitted, the cost of emissions partially rests on the original emitters. There are a variety of methods for pricing emissions, including carbon taxes, cap and trade, and regulations and standards.

Nations that implement carbon pricing within their borders can consider pairing that with a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which levels the playing field by ensuring that both domestic and foreign manufacturers pay the cost of their pollution. Implementing a CBAM without a domestic carbon pricing policy would likely be considered protectionism by trading partners, and could invite retaliation.

Inversely, policy analysts emphasize that environmental degradation is an unfair trade practice. Regulations generally increase the cost of production, so countries with lower industry standards can make cheaper products, but usually with a higher overall emissions intensity. The status quo system perpetuates U.S. companies importing inexpensive and carbon-intensive materials.

The European Union and the United Kingdom, which both have domestic carbon pricing policies in place, have both recently announced CBAM initiatives to tax imported carbon-intensive products and account for the direct and indirect emissions associated with their manufacturing. These CBAM policies work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported product compared to the same product produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The emissions intensity of a product accounts for the material inputs, off-site electricity and heat, and final product manufacturing emissions (like raw material extraction or transportation). In 2021, stainless steel produced in Indonesia emitted 4.25 times the amount of greenhouse gases of steel produced in the United States, and the steel industry in China had double the emissions intensity of the U.S. steel industry.

CBAM market-based climate policies also aim to limit carbon leakage, or the transfer of production-related emissions to another country to avoid regulation or fees. For example, if a country in Europe should decide to import all of its steel because it is carbon intensive to produce, it would no longer be held accountable for any steel-related carbon emissions. Its domestic emissions would fall, making it easier to meet carbon reduction goals, but overall emissions would likely rise, which would defeat the goals’ purpose. With a CBAM, if the country is importing carbon-intensive steel, there will be a cost associated with that, putting more responsibility on the consuming country. In this way, a CBAM ideally incentivizes trade partners to reduce their production-related emissions.

There are numerous ways to implement a CBAM-like program. Each goes by a different name—CBAM, Methane Border Adjustment Mechanism (Methane BAM), Border Pollution Mechanism, and Foreign Pollution Fee—and involves different fine print, players, and intensity.

In recent years, proposed policies in the United States have attempted to launch carbon pricing mechanisms similar to those across the pond. In the 118th Congress, the Clean Competition Act (S.3422/H.R.6622) and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.3198) both aimed to set a price on carbon-intensive products, but with starkly different approaches. Neither bill made it past introduction last Congress, but the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325) was reintroduced by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the 119th Congress in April 2025.

The revenue from the Clean Competition Act’s CBAM, championed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), would be directed towards decarbonization, while the Foreign Pollution Fee Act does not specify where the revenue would be sent. The latter focuses more on boosting domestic manufacturing and national security under the Made in America policy agenda, with emissions reductions as a secondary benefit. Furthermore, the foreign pollution fee would only tax imported goods, while the Clean Competition Act would tax both imported and domestic products relative to their carbon emissions. Although emission reductions are likely to be more significant if domestic manufacturers also have a financial incentive to reduce product emissions intensity, a domestic carbon tax is a harder sell politically.

Sens. Whitehouse and Cassidy often speak about their ideas for CBAM-like programs. In February 2025, the Silverado Policy Accelerator hosted a fireside chat with the two lawmakers to examine the impact of carbon pricing on the United States and its trade partners. Silverado presented new research about the potential environmental and economic benefits of a CBAM for the trade of aluminum and steel, which are both carbon intensive to produce. Steel and aluminum are the first products to be affected by the European Union CBAM.

The Silverado study applied two fee-setting approaches: per ton and relative difference. The per ton fee looks at the difference between imported emissions-intensive goods and goods produced domestically, then applies a dollar amount per additional metric ton of carbon emitted by the foreign manufacturer. The relative difference fee is based on the assessed value of the item and set at a rate of either 0.6% or 0.9% for every 1% more emissions intensive the import is than the domestic product.

Using wrought aluminum as an example, if the tax is $55 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (the starting fee of the Clean Competition Act), then there would be an estimated 18% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources (e.g., China, South Korea, India, South Africa, Turkey, and Mexico) and a 2% increase in imports to the United States from less carbon-intensive sources (Canada and the European Union). However, a relative difference tax of 0.9% (the highest proposed rate of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act) under the same circumstances would lead to an 82% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources and a 9% increase in imports to the United States from less-carbon intensive sources. No domestic carbon fee was included in this analysis, and the report assumes that domestic manufacturing would fill the product void from lost imports.

A CBAM program would create an economic opportunity for U.S. producers. The steel industry could see an $8.5 billion increase in domestic markets, with aluminum closely following at $6 billion in newly claimed production by 2030. Additionally, the shift to domestic production would likely create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually.

Under a CBAM, the shift of manufacturing back to the United States could encourage energy efficiency in the industrial sector, since the fewer emissions the sector generates, the harder it would be for foreign companies to compete and reduce their CBAM fees. At EESI’s Clean Manufacturing in America briefing, panelist Nora Wang Esram, now the CEO at New Buildings Institute, explained how the industrial sector’s energy usage has doubled in the past 70 years, and an estimated 50% of the energy consumed in industrial applications is lost through waste heat. Certain industries are considering electrification, industrial heat pumps, and thermal heat batteries to increase efficiency. Esram noted that complexity, competition, and cost are three barriers to entry for new, more efficient technologies and retrofitted systems. A CBAM policy could not only encourage reduced carbon intensity of the industrial sector globally, but also help adapt U.S. supply chains and promote investments in clean and efficient equipment and facilities here at home.",,N,,2025-05-30 17:08:55.555711

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced the implementation of emergency permitting procedures to expeditiously review geothermal energy projects critical for U.S. national security and Energy Dominance. This action is part of the Department’s efforts to address the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025.

By streamlining environmental reviews, the Department aims to accelerate geothermal projects that address urgent national security and energy needs while maintaining environmental stewardship.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

Several proposed geothermal projects led by Ormat Nevada, Inc. will be among the first geothermal projects covered by the Department’s new emergency permitting procedures:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada) – Ormat plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased land to determine whether the geothermal reservoir is commercially viable.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada) – This effort involves upgrading and expanding three existing geothermal power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 MW solar photovoltaic field. These improvements aim to increase efficiency and boost output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada) – Ormat is evaluating geothermal potential on leased public lands through test drilling and exploration activities.

These proposed projects pursue the kind of reliable and strategically important energy development the Department seeks to accelerate—supporting both national defense and domestic energy resilience. Once the Bureau of Land Management completes its environmental assessments within a 14-day timeframe, it will determine whether Ormat’s proposed projects can move forward.

The Bureau of Land Management oversees geothermal development on federal lands by leasing sites to companies, conducting environmental reviews, and issuing permits for exploration and production. The bureau ensures projects comply with environmental and safety standards, balances geothermal development with other land uses and manages royalties from operations. Essentially, BLM manages and regulates geothermal resources to promote responsible energy development on public lands.

The Department is using emergency authorities under existing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act. Interior has prepared a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the emergency procedures. Project proponents interested in requesting emergency coverage should contact their regular points of contact at the pertinent field, district or state office.

Broadcast version by Isobel Charle for Washington News Service reporting for the WorkingNation-Public News Service Collaboration

As with many cities and towns, if an economy doesn't change with the times, opportunities for work and personal growth can stagnate. Change is crucial.

Historically, the industries of Spokane, Washington were natural resources-related, including mining and timber. ""It's modified over the years to a place where health care, health sciences, and education are really a big part of what we have in the city,"" says Mayor Lisa Brown.

""We have a very diversified economy,"" adding that what she calls 'emerging sectors' - aerospace, tech, and clean energy - are also fueling expansion.

Located in eastern Washington, Spokane has a population of 230,000. About 81% of Spokane's population identifies as white alone, 7.8% as Hispanic or Latino, 2.9% as Asian alone, 2.7% as Black alone, and 1.3% as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Brown says the area is dominated by the baby boomer generation, but the evolving economy is making Spokane more appealing to a younger population. She says goals for expanding housing, being mindful around land use, and ensuring a good transit system means, ""We can be a more attractive, affordable place for young people.""

Brown assumed her mayoral role in 2024, for a term that runs through 2027. Among her previous roles, she was chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, a state legislator, and director of the Washington State Department of Commerce.

She is using her past experiences in education, government, and business development to pull together a coalition of community thought leaders who are connecting local residents to career opportunities with the goal of building a strong economy.

An even bigger goal is putting residents on the pathway to economic mobility and prosperity.

Exploring Careers at a Young Age

""I describe us as 'infrastructure builders.' We think about the types of things, the conditions that need to be created for us all to be successful 10 years from now, for the economy to grow, and for us all to prosper,"" says Erin Vincent, VP of education and talent at Greater Spokane Inc. (GSI) - the region's business development organization.

GSI notes, ""We can't do this work alone. We partner with local businesses, our community, nonprofits, and the surrounding region to build a robust regional economy.""

Vincent says, ""In my area of workforce development, that means working on childcare. It means working on career-connected learning, thinking about how we can create the conditions for students to think about whatever their best future might be from that postsecondary perspective. It means supporting K-12 education.""

She says young students are getting a glimpse at the idea of careers in a variety of ways, including through career fairs, members of industry visiting schools, and education-focused programming on a local television outlet.

""Whether it's trades, apprenticeships, two-year, four-year, any of those options are great options. They are right for a lot of kids,"" says Vincent. ""The real key is that idea of creating an atmosphere of valuing whatever best suits a student.""

Experiential Learning Introduces Students to Potential Careers

A GSI initiative - Business AfterSchool - gives local students in grades 6-12 the chance to ""gain real-life skills and experiential learning in a workplace setting.""

Vincent says, ""In terms of a mindset perspective, there's probably no better way to actually get a kid to start seeing themselves as X, Y, Z than to actually get them there."" She says about 12 host businesses participate in Business AfterSchool during the academic year.

Vincent says one such business is Wagstaff, Inc., a longstanding partner that brings students in-house to observe various jobs on the manufacturing floor.

The manufacturing workforce pipeline needs a boost, according to Wade Larson, Wagstaff's director of workforce development.

""We did a study for Department of Commerce in the state about three years ago on the workforce for advanced manufacturing and aerospace. Bottom line - we don't have the numbers.""

He says bringing students to Wagstaff for Business AfterSchool is a valuable in-person experience, ""'I need you to come see us. Do cool stuff.' The idea is to capture some of these kids when they come out of high school.""

A more in-depth Wagstaff experience is the Production & Manufacturing Institute (PMI) - a three-week summer immersion program for incoming high school juniors and seniors.

""The students work as product teams to design, manufacture, and sell actual products for customers,"" explains Larson. ""In the meantime, we'll teach 'em a little bit of welding, a little bit of machining, take 'em out to live sites. And through this whole thing, they get to make money. They get to make stuff. They have a full experience.""

He says a lot of effort is made collecting feedback from the students and teacher participants - what they like and don't like, how the experience can be enhanced.

Helping Local Schools Shape Curriculum

Larson notes challenges faced by educators - not being able to always teach what's needed by industry. ""We're not telling the schools what we need. The schools are doing their best to figure it out themselves, but we in business need to step up, take the lead, throw money at it, and step into the classroom to say, 'Here we are. Let us help.'""

The Spokane Public Schools - which offers CTE (career and technical education) programming - states, "" With rising tuition costs, many high school graduates are looking toward trade apprenticeship programs as satisfying alternative career paths.""

Courses are available for both middle and high school students. The district says, ""Middle school CTE courses are exploratory, covering STEM, video production, and publishing.

""In high school, all courses are categorized into one of the 16 nationally recognized Career Clusters, which group jobs and industries by related skills or products/services. Courses typically progress from exploratory to preparatory stages, offering opportunities such as dual credit (college credit), industry certifications, internships, or apprenticeships.""

Opportunities for Advanced Manufacturing

Aerospace and tech are among the sector shifts in Spokane mentioned by Brown. The region's American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center (AAMMC) is expected to be ""critical to advancing U.S. economic and national security by onshoring and upscaling manufacturing technologies that support our domestic aircraft supply chain.""

Brown says, ""We have been awarded a significant stream of funding - upwards of $40 million. I will say that this is something that has broad sector support. We've got bipartisan senators supportive of this. So, we're cautiously hopeful that our funds are secure and that we really can make these key investments to build out the vision.""

The AAMMC already has a designated location at a former Triumph aerospace facility, notes Brown. ""This is not just a concept on a piece of paper. There's a facility. There is a set of workforce certificates being developed at the higher ed level and the set of collaborations around how to potentially engage in a scale-up of some manufacturing.""

She says, additionally, the facility will require advanced-level research and a test bed for next-generation materials to see if they're appropriate for the aerospace sector.

""This Tech Hub really brought stakeholders across the workforce system together because the capacity is there. We need everybody.

""We need the colleges, we need the K-12 system, we need the Workforce Councils, and the other training partners,"" says Shana Peschek, executive director of the Machinists Institute - the nonprofit arm of IAM District 751 (International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers).

""That's really where we see ourselves, especially around helping people understand what these careers are.""

Peschek says about the Tech Hub, ""We are leasing a small footprint there. We had a meeting to talk about what exact skills they would want us teaching around those materials - composites and thermal plastics.

""The partnership means that we'll have students in the building where this amazing facility is operating, really being innovative, and a global leader - and the employers and manufacturers have access to individuals from the region that are being skilled-up in that technology.""

Aside from the Tech Hub, the Institute has been involved in skills training for a number of years. Established in 2018, the Institute offers a pre-apprenticeship program called Machinists Institute Career Accelerator (MICA), as well as six Registered Apprenticeship pathways including machinist, industrial machinery technician, and fabrication welder.

Peschek notes in addition to aerospace and advanced manufacturing, other industries are under the Machinists' umbrella including maritime, clean energy, and supply chain.

The Institute is currently expanding its own current training and education center in Spokane. Expected to launch in July, Peschek says the offerings will include welding, machining, and heavy equipment/diesel.

Postsecondary Education Collaboration

Collaboration with community colleges has been highly productive, according to Peschek. ""Our machinist apprentices can get an associate degree at the same time that they journey out.

""We've been really breaking down barriers because we really want our students to understand that this degree, whether they felt like they needed one or not, it's there in the future - just in case - and helps open advanced pathways for them.""

She says Spokane Community College (SCC) has been an important partner.

Brown adds, ""We support people moving into the trades through apprenticeships. And now pre-apprenticeships. Through pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships, we're also trying to create pathways into more specialized training.""

In order to help get qualified applicants into an apprenticeship program, SCC offers an apprenticeship prep course - Skilled Trades Preparation (STP), explains Kenna May, the school's manager of apprenticeship.

STP runs for 11 weeks, 24 hours per week. May says in addition to spending three hours per day in the shop, students learn extensively about workplace safety.

She notes, ""They also build a tiny house - all the components for that house. They do the blueprints, the framing, the drywall, the roofing. They'll put in doors and windows. They'll run electricity to them. Our goal is to really teach them a little bit about a lot of different trades.""

May notes that about 50% of the students that complete STP will move to a Registered Apprenticeship program - compared to the statewide articulation average of about 38%.

Regarding apprenticeship, she says, ""It's a combination of on-the-job training and classroom time. The college is the classroom portion of apprenticeship. Less than 10% of actual apprenticeship training is in the classroom.

""The majority of the training is done on the job. Our programs vary in length between two and five years, depending on the craft.""

May says the five-year programs include those pathways for electricians, sheet metal workers, plumbers, and steam fitters. Laborers and bricklayers are shorter programs.

She notes SCC's Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Center is made available for use by several other programs that do not have their own training facilities - at no cost. Overall, SCC partners with 19 different programs representing about 27 trades, according to May.

When someone expresses interest in a particular pathway, May says, that person is referred to the specific program to apply. The program - not SCC - leads the process. ""You do testing in their interview process, then once they accept you in their program - they'll get you a job and put you out to work. Then they give a schedule to the students for when they're going to be coming in for class,"" she explains.

May reminds apprenticeship is dependent upon the economy. ""Our programs are not going to take apprentices if there's not a job for them. Our programs do look to the future of jobs coming up and try to anticipate how many they're going to need.""

Entry into the Trades for People with Barriers to Employment

The Pre-Employment Preparation Program (PEPP) is a hands-on pre-apprenticeship course - that consists of 160 hours over four weeks.

""We work with the building trades and all of our students who graduate with their certifications have a designated benefit of direct entry into the trade that they feel they want to do the most,"" says Shannon Corrick, PEPP's executive director.

According to PEPP, the program encourages ""disenfranchised individuals or those who are working low-wage jobs to apply for the PEPP class.

""We are also working closely with the criminal justice system to assist as many individuals as possible to enroll in PEPP immediately upon reentering the community so that they can be prepared to enter a family-wage apprenticeship position following completion of their PEPP class.""

Corrick notes that wraparound services are a key PEPP component. ""We can take care of their housing for a month. We can take care of their power bill for a month, their phone bill, their internet bill, their car payment, and then daycare, absolutely 100% daycare.

""We like to say it's not a handout, it's a hand up.""

Participants who complete the training earn certifications including OSHA 10, flagging (traffic control), CPR, and forklift qualification credential.

Corrick says trainees have had success transitioning into the trades, ""As far as our grants and our North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) certification, we are required to have 15% placements. That's our bare minimum. I do know from the September class, we have a 60% placement rate.""

Health Care Pathways

Brown says, ""We're not known necessarily as a health sciences city, but we have this health sciences cluster.""

""One in five people in Spokane County works in health care. It's our largest industry,"" says Erin William Hueter, executive director of Health Sciences and Services Authority (HSSA) of Spokane County. ""Our focus is on biosciences economic development and the promotion of public health. And we do that mostly through grantmaking,""

Williams Hueter says, ""So, connection to that research and growing that field is beneficial to the health of the residents of our region. But also, these are well-paying jobs. When we have people that are earning a good income and have a stable base in their economic lives, their health improves because they have access to health care in new ways.

""I think what's important about the development of really innovative technologies, innovative practices in health care, when you're in a community where so many of us work in health care and every single one of us is impacted by the health care delivery system - seeing that job growth, seeing new people being trained in that area, it's just critical to our wellbeing.""

As a former chancellor at Washington State University Spokane, Brown says, ""When I was at WSU Spokane, we created the state's second public medical school. So now we actually have both the University of Washington and WSU Medical School.""

Williams Hueter adds the organization - through its grant awards - is addressing the area's provider shortage, particularly how long it takes to see a primary care doctor. ""Contracts have been signed addressing provider shortages. So, we've got organizations that are addressing it through working to train more professionals.""

Grant recipients include Asante Health, Joya Child and Family Development Center, Latinos En Spokane, and Maddie's Place .

""What an incredible resource to have two medical schools in our region because - boy, do we need health care providers. Not just in Spokane County, but in the more rural areas that surround Spokane County, as well. Seeing those doctors stay in the area is so important,"" says Williams Hueter.

Pacific Northwest University - which has an osteopathic medicine program and is based in Yakima - also has a presence in Spokane.

Traci Couture Richmond, executive director of Spokane Teaching Health Center (STHC), explains, ""We are training family medicine and internal medicine residents. They've graduated from medical school. They now have come to their residency. And so, in Spokane, we are responsible for developing the next primary care workforce here.""

She also addresses the need for these doctors, ""What you're seeing is people are being forced into urgent cares, in emergency rooms to take care of issues that they're having - in settings that are not appropriate. That could be prevented by access to primary care.""

In addition, Couture Richmond says Psychiatry Residency Spokane - which is affiliated with both the University of Washington and Washington State University - has its outpatient clinic located at STHC.

""Their residents are here embedded with our internal medicine and family medicine residents. They're able to learn from each other.""

Couture Richmond says not everyone is comfortable seeing a resident for treatment, ""Residency clinics have kind of a quiet stigma - 'I don't want to go there because they're not real doctors.' And they are. They're doctors that are learning. You're also being seen by one of their preceptors who's been a physician for a long period of time.""

Upon completion of their residencies, a number of doctors remain in Spokane or rural communities outside of the area, she notes.

""Of our internal medicine program, we're retaining about 55 to 60% of those in the Spokane area. Many in internal medicine, typically they go off to be a hospitalist or then they move into a critical care fellowship.

""Family medicine has been a little bit of a different story for us. We have retained around 20%, but the other large group of them are going out into small rural communities and practicing the medicine that they were trained to do. From birth to death, they're doing all of that care in these small rural communities.""

The Emerging Clean Energy Sector

Brown says, ""There's really interesting stuff happening in clean energy. I mean, we have this river and waterpower. We've developed solar and wind in eastern Washington, and that has led to now looking at batteries and things like that.""

Spokane has a number of environmental initiatives around renewable energy, urban forestry, and stormwater and wastewater, among others. The local Water Department owns and operates the Upriver Hydroelectric Dam on the Spokane River.

""The basic idea is that the climate crisis continues to get worse and institutions like Gonzaga University have a real clear sense of our mission which involves graduating students who are people - for and with others - who want to create a just society and have care for a common home,"" explains Brian G. Henning, Ph.D., director of the Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment.

The Gonzaga Climate Institute ""engages in regional capacity building, scholarship, and teaching to promote the flourishing of Inland Northwest communities, waters, and lands in the face of a changing climate.""

Henning says the school offers a BA in environmental studies, a BS in environmental science, as well as a sustainable business minor in the School of Business. ""Those are the programs that are most obviously connected to understanding different aspects of the environment, and we get really amazing students in all of those programs.""

Gonzaga offers career resources for students who complete these areas of study for post-university life.

There are hiring opportunities for students while they are still in school, according to Henning. ""The Climate Literacy Project was one of our very first projects. We started hiring Gonzaga students who serve as climate literacy fellows.

""They're typically environmental studies or environmental science students, but they could be from any discipline. We train them and they go in pairs into K-8 classrooms, and they deliver hands-on climate science lessons.""

He says some of the program's fellows have gone on to pursue environmental education as a career - for example, working for nonprofits in different parts of the country or for the [National] Park Service.

For learners anywhere, Henning says there is the opportunity to earn a professional certificate in climate action planning. He says, ""That program is available to community members from around the world who are interested in helping their communities develop plans for how to understand, how to be resilient, and how to reduce their contributions to climate change.""

Additionally, the Gonzaga Climate Institute created the Climate Resilience Project in 2022 in ""response to the increasing need for extreme heat research and community action."" Henning says, ""We hire students who are climate project assistants...who work 10 to 15 hours a week. They're doing research, they're doing community engagement, they're helping to coordinate and facilitate the combination of those two.""

Due to the threat of wildfire and the resulting smoke, Henning says they are ""developing heat and smoke response plans with the City of Spokane.""

He also mentions the Cataldo Project - which he describes as ""a curriculum and pedagogy workshop that Gonzaga faculty from any discipline can take.

""They come for a two-day workshop to explore how they can incorporate climate and sustainability concepts into their courses, their existing classes - not so much by dislodging content - but by infusing sustainability and climate themes.""

'Where is our village for our parents?'

As the conversation between Brown and WorkingNation was wrapping, she made a point to add, ""I'm very passionate about pre-K and early learning.

""I think a lot of it starts there. And the community is also coming together collaboratively around that sector and around childcare workers and people who are in early learning They need to be supported in order to get this whole thing off the ground right from the very beginning.""

""I really dug my heels into this idea of being a tool of healing and safety for the community, but also to focus on the education of early learners and to ensure that they were kindergarten-ready,"" says Kerra Bower, owner of Little Scholars Development Center and founder of Raze Development. ""We really started building our program to ensure that we closed the education gap as much as we possibly could.""

The programming serves children from four months to 12 years.

""The Maasai tribe asks that question, 'How are the children?' The idea is if the children are well and our community is well, then we are thriving,"" says Bower.

""My question has been, and will always be, 'Where is our village? Where is our village for our parents?' It is incredibly important. In all my programs, across the board, they're built on this idea that the parent is the cornerstone teacher. We are there to support the parent because if the parent is healthy and whole, then we're raising whole healthy humans.""

Bower says she first met Brown when she was with the Washington State Department of Commerce. ""One of the things I said to her [around childcare] was, 'This is a workforce development issue. This is an economic vitality and upward mobility issue. If you don't have a stable childcare environment and industry, you don't have workforce development or economic vitality.'""

After winning her run for mayor, Brown appointed Bower to her transition team. Bower says, ""She could have very well put me into the family engagement and family connection group, which is a very important group.

""But instead, she put me in the workforce and economic development group. I was the only childcare provider, and I would even venture to say the only actual small business in that group. For me, it really pinpointed her understanding.""

Bower says in addition to parents and their children, the teachers and caregivers need support, as well. ""We have to be able to provide a balance for them, and that comes in the form of the mental and behavioral health supports that are readily available to them in their classrooms.

""These are human beings. These are not childcare whisperers. They're not super humans. They are people who just happen to love little people. It's humanizing the individuals that are in your classrooms.""

'Quality of life-focused'

""I want the city to grow and thrive for my son, for my grandson, and for the future,"" says Brown. ""We're the second largest city in Washington State. The region is very quality of life-focused.""

An unsuccessful bid for Congress caused a shift in Brown's perspective. ""It got me even more connected to the region, to the city. I felt like the change that I wanted to see - if I couldn't help make it happen at the national level - that really here was the right place.""

She acknowledges that she is not doing the work alone. ""The best part of this job is that really I deeply engaged and networked. I know higher ed leaders. I know business leaders. I know nonprofit leaders, activists, and so that has made it easier for me.""

Wrapping Up The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution.","The electric vehicle landscape in Canada has witnessed a significant power shift in the first quarter of 2025. General Motors (GM) has surged ahead of Tesla in overall EV sales, marking a dramatic turn in a market that many previously considered to be firmly in Tesla's grasp. This remarkable feat comes on the back of a staggering 252% year-over-year increase in GM's electric vehicle sales, fueled by a compelling lineup of new and increasingly popular models. The vehicles leading this charge are the highly anticipated Chevrolet Equinox EV, the robust Silverado EV, and the stylish Cadillac OPTIQ.

This surge in GM's EV sales contrasts sharply with the fortunes of the former Canadian EV sales leader, Tesla. In a stunning reversal, Tesla experienced an 87% drop in sales, plummeting from 5,097 units in the fourth quarter of 2024 to a mere 534 units in the first quarter of 2025. This precipitous decline points to a confluence of factors that have seemingly impacted the brand's appeal and market position in Canada.

Factors Behind Tesla's Sales Plunge

Several elements appear to have contributed to Tesla's significant sales drop in Canada. One key factor is the suspension of both federal and provincial electric vehicle incentives. Canada's Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) program, which offered up to CA$5,000 in federal rebates, paused indefinitely on January 12th, 2025, after allocated funds were fully exhausted. Additionally, Quebec's Roulez vert program, a significant provincial incentive, also saw a temporary suspension. The removal of these financial incentives has undoubtedly made EVs, including Teslas, less accessible to a wider range of consumers, impacting overall sales volumes.

Beyond the economic factors, the actions and public persona of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, particularly his alignment with the current US administration, appear to be taking a toll on the brand's reputation and consequently, its sales in Canada. Marketing experts suggest that Musk's outspoken political views have alienated a significant portion of potential buyers who may not align with his stance. In a market like Canada, which often holds distinct political and social views compared to the US, such brand association can have a tangible impact on consumer preferences.

GM's Winning Strategy: Diverse Lineup and Neutral Stance

In contrast to Tesla's challenges, GM's success in Canada seems to stem from a combination of a more diverse EV lineup and a more politically neutral public image. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, with 1,892 units sold in Q1 2025, led GM's charge GM takes over as the '#1 EV seller' in Canada - Electrek. This affordable electric SUV caters to a broad segment of the market looking for a practical and cost-effective EV option. The Silverado EV, with 894 units sold, taps into the popular pickup truck segment, offering an electric alternative to a traditionally gasoline-dominated category. Finally, the Cadillac OPTIQ, with 615 units sold, provides a compelling entry point into the luxury EV market for the GM brand. This diverse portfolio allows GM to appeal to a wider range of buyers with varying needs and preferences.

While direct evidence linking GM's political neutrality to its success in China is less quantifiable, anecdotal observations suggest that in politically sensitive markets, a less overtly political stance can be beneficial. GM has maintained a relatively low public profile regarding contentious political issues, focusing instead on its products and its commitment to the Chinese market. While GM has faced challenges in China, with an overall sales decline in the previous year, there were signs of rebound in the fourth quarter. This suggests that GM's strategy of focusing on its vehicle offerings and maintaining a less polarizing public image may be resonating with consumers in key markets like China, mirroring its current success in Canada.

Wrapping Up

The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution. While the suspension of government incentives has undoubtedly played a role, Tesla's significant sales decline also points to the potential impact of brand perception and the actions of its leadership. GM's success, on the other hand, highlights the strength of a diverse EV lineup that caters to different segments of the market, coupled with a potentially advantageous neutral political stance, which may also be contributing to their performance in other significant global markets like China. This Canadian snapshot serves as a compelling reminder that in the rapidly evolving EV landscape, product diversity, market sensitivity, and even the perceived neutrality of a brand can be crucial factors in achieving and maintaining market leadership.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits.
The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs.
“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond.
“The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace.","Solar energy is increasingly popular among faith-based institutions. Recently, two synagogues, thousands of miles apart but with similar economic and environmental commitments, have installed solar arrays on their buildings. In California, the Valley Beth Shalom (VBS) synagogue installed 425 kilowatts’ (kW) worth of solar panels to lower energy costs, increase sustainability, and provide an educational opportunity to the community.1 With similar purposes in mind, the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center (MVHC) in Massachusetts installed 75 solar panels, providing 30 kW of energy, in 2023.

Both VBS and the MVHC took advantage of direct pay, the monetization of clean energy tax credits for nonprofits. Until 2022, only organizations with a tax liability could access clean energy tax credits; nonprofits and tax-exempt entities were locked out from claiming such credits when installing solar panels or other clean energy measures. Thanks to the elective pay (a.k.a. direct pay) option introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), these entities can claim tax incentives when investing in clean energy projects, such as solar energy, ground-source heat pumps, and battery storage devices. These small-scale renewable energy projects enable lower energy bills and increased resilience and can help create quality contractor and installation jobs, generating local wealth and spurring further demand for these distributed technologies.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits. Direct pay is a game-changer because it gives nonprofits access to the same financial incentives that for-profit companies have received for years when investing in renewable energy. As the monetization of a tax credit, direct pay is not a point-of-sale rebate or a federal grant.

Federal tax credits are handled by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), so nonprofits seeking to claim direct pay must complete IRS Forms 3468 and 3800, along with their 990-T tax returns. They must file them the year after the eligible clean energy project is “put into service.” Depending on when the clean energy project was installed and placed into service and when the tax return was filed, the entire process can take anywhere between four and 18 months.

In March 2025, the MVHC received the base 30% direct pay payment for its solar array installation, which was put into service last year.2 While most organizations can expect to claim between 30 and 50% of a project’s costs, if the law’s bonus credits are stacked, they can claim up to 70% of the total cost of domestically-sourced projects located in low-income communities. There is no limit to the number of eligible projects a nonprofit can claim direct pay for in a single tax year.

VBS and the MVHC are not alone in pursuing environmental and financial stability by installing solar panels on their buildings. According to a 2023 federal report, places of worship had installed more than 2,500 solar systems by the end of 2021, representing approximately 170 megawatts (MW) of capacity—enough to power more than 28,500 households for one year. With these solar installations, houses of worship collectively avoid 236,000 tons of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to removing nearly 50,000 cars from the road. Now that houses of worship can benefit from the same tax credits afforded to commercial businesses, their solar installations are expected to accelerate considerably.

Valley Beth Shalom Installs Solar Panels to “Repair the World”

Driven by sustainability, community, and financial considerations, Valley Beth Shalom completed the installation of 868 Q-Cell rooftop solar panels this month, making it the largest solar array installation in a California synagogue and one of the largest for a synagogue in the entire country. Informed by Jewish environmental values, VBS installed solar panels on almost every square foot of the 130,000-square-foot roof of the main building on its five-acre campus in Encino, California. Working with Sunistics Group, which designed the solar installation, VBS initiated construction of the solar array in December 2024.

The 425 kW solar array is expected to save the synagogue approximately 614,552 kWh annually, equivalent to $180,014. By generating clean energy locally, VBS will replace 80% of the energy it currently sources from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, VBS's local utility. While 43.4% of the utility’s energy mix comes from renewable sources (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric), 42.7% still comes from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal.

Installing solar panels is a financially viable investment for nonprofit organizations like VBS. Energy costs are the second-highest operational expense for many nonprofits, behind only salaries. The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs. At VBS, the savings will be invested in educational programs and hands-on learning opportunities for students and families in the community, advancing environmental stewardship and empowering the next generation to embrace sustainability. VBS will develop programs centered around the installed solar panels to educate the community about renewable energy and the connection between sustainability and Jewish values.

The total cost for the solar array installation reached $1.2 million, including inverters. VBS received several grants, low-interest loans, and donations from the community to finance the solar panels. Through the Jewish Solar Challenge, VBS received a $150,000 grant in 2023. In that same year, VBS secured a $100,000 zero-percent interest loan from the Adamah Climate Action Fund, a loan program run by Adamah, a national Jewish climate organization that VBS is a member of. Additionally, as a nonprofit organization, VBS will apply for direct pay this year, once the panels are put into service, to recoup at least 30% of the project costs.

""Everything that we do at Valley Beth Shalom revolves around tikkun olam, or ‘repair the world’,"" said Matthew Weintraub, executive director at VBS. “We are good stewards of the environment, an integral part of our Jewish values. We focus on spending money and energy on things that make an impact on the community.”

Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center

Looking to make a significant contribution to its community amid high electricity rates, the MVHC decided to install solar panels. The center completed a 76-panel 30 kW array in May 2023 and put it into service in July of that year. The total cost for the solar array installation was $76,000. The 30 kW solar array is already saving the MVHC hundreds of dollars annually, which they used to install a new heat pump in place of their old propane-fueled furnace.

“In 2022, we installed solar panels in our house, and we wanted to do the same for the Hebrew Center,"" said Ricky Diamond, the first vice president of the MVHC. “We are a small community with 324 members, with many concerned about climate change and how to get off fossil fuels. We saw solar panels as a way to do good for the environment, the community, and save money on our utility bills.”

As a nonprofit organization, the center filed for a 30% direct pay disbursement for its solar panels in June 2024 through IRS forms 990-T, 3800, and 3468. Due to the novelty of the direct pay process, Ricky and his wife Batya had difficulty finding an accountant who was familiar with the required paperwork for nonprofits seeking clean energy credits, so they filed themselves. After months of back-and-forth with the IRS, the MVHC received a check for $24,405.85 in March 2025, representing 30% of the solar project’s costs, plus interest from the IRS for issuing the direct pay payment late.

As a tax-exempt house of worship, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center was never obliged to file tax returns with the IRS. But because direct pay credits are processed through an organization’s tax return, the center had to file a tax return in 2024, the year after its eligible clean energy project was put into service, to claim its credits. The Hebrew Center will not need to file tax returns in subsequent years, unless it claims credits for future projects.

Through its communications with the IRS, the MVHC discovered that, as a first-time tax filer, it could determine the starting month of its tax year without being tied to the calendar year. Given that the clean energy system was fully commissioned with its local utility in July 2023, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center decided to start its tax year that month, and end it in June 2024.

“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond. “The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace. We are slowly becoming energy independent.”

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management appears to be promoting the polluting of mountain views with supposedly green energy. Multiple pages on bureau’s website for siting wind energy on public lands show the same photo of dozens of wind turbines blocking the view of snow-covered mountains.

“Renewables are booming” proclaims a November 2024 headline on the Sierra Club website, right above a picture of a sunset blocked by wind turbines.

The page for “Renewable Energy” from the Union of Concerned Scientists boasts of “little or no pollution” and then provides a photo of wind turbines filling a mountain pass.

The Natural Resources Defense Council website promotes a photo of dozens of wind turbines filling the scenery underneath a snow-capped mountain. The caption reads: “Limiting dirty fossil fuel production and transitioning to clean energy, like wind and solar, are critical in building a livable future.”

Inherent Hypocrisy

Though unintentional, this cheerleading is an honest portrayal of two serious and hypocritical problems inherent in weather-dependent energy systems:

They must devour a lot of land—otherwise known as “the environment” that the environmental groups claim to be conserving.

The windy and sunny land (and ocean frontage) these systems need are often the same open spaces humans enjoy looking at and living near.

A 2021 analysis from Bloomberg News, titled “The U.S. Will Need a Lot of Land for a Zero-Carbon Economy,” came to this conclusion:

Wind farms, solar installations and other forms of clean power take up far more space on a per-watt basis than their fossil-fuel-burning brethren. A 200-megawatt wind farm, for instance, might require spreading turbines over 19 square miles (49 square kilometres). A natural gas power plant with that same generating capacity could fit onto a single city block. [emphasis added]

The Bloomberg report provided this graphic to explain that getting comparable wattage from wind requires 370 times more land than natural gas, and that solar needs 140 times as much land:

As shown above, obtaining electricity from carbon-free nuclear power is also far gentler on land use than wind and solar. Bloomberg provided this commentary:

Natural gas and nuclear energy are very compact power sources. A conventional 1-gigawatt reactor operating on 1,000 acres produces the same power as a wind farm spanning 100,000 acres.

For perspective, 100,000 acres is the equivalent of 156 square miles—or a hunk of the Earth larger than major cities such as Detroit, Michigan.

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy reached this conclusion:

Despite producing massive amounts of carbon-free power, nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear facility in the United States needs a little more than 1 square mile to operate . . . you would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor or more than 430 wind turbines.

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wrights said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to a memorandum he issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

American Cast Iron Pipe Company (metal manufacturing): $75 million

Brimstone Energy (low-carbon materials): $189 million

Calpine’s Sutter Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Eastman Chemical Company’s Longview Plant (molecular plastic recycling): $375 million

Exxon Mobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant (chemical plant): $331.9 million

Skyven Technologies (heat pump steam generation): $15.3 million

Sublime Systems (low carbon cement): $86.9 million

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful things that things could be resolved with the DOE.

Many of the canceled projects focused on carbon capture or low-carbon cement.
17 of the canceled projects are from the Industrial Demonstrations Program, which aims to support the decarbonization of heavy industries like steel, cement, and aluminum.
The announcement comes less than a month after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright testified before Congress that no OCED cut lists existed.

The announcement comes less than a month after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright testified before Congress that no OCED cut lists existed.

In response to the news, the Sierra Club’s Industrial Transformation campaign issued the following statements:

“DOGE and the Trump Administration have just killed dozens of major investments in American competitiveness, good jobs, and cleaner air to support Trump’s tax cuts and line the pockets of billionaires. These projects were not just pro-climate; they were pro-jobs, pro-innovation, and pro-public health. American workers, fenceline communities, and forward-thinking companies have had the rug pulled out from under them,” said Iliana Paul, deputy director for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

“As part of the agreement for receiving the grants, companies were all required to engage with the community and address some of the biggest concerns that local residents had with the project. These included pollution and public safety concerns, alongside hiring local workers and investing in programs that would benefit local residents. By pulling the plug from 24 projects, the Trump administration and DOGE are taking away efforts that would support the wellbeing and economic vitality of manufacturing communities. This is a betrayal of public trust,” said Yong Kwon, senior advisor for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

BACKGROUND

According to Bloomberg, the cuts include funding to Heidelberg Materials and Sublime Systems for pilot projects to manufacture low-carbon cement. Earlier this week, Sublime announced it had signed an agreement with Microsoft to buy more than 600,000 tons of its low-carbon cement — which calls into question the Trump administration’s argument that the canceled projects were not “economically viable.”

Interestingly, the cut list did not include funding to Cleveland Cliffs for a project to transition its coal-reliant steelmaking processes to hydrogen — despite the fact that the Cleveland Cliffs CEO said in May that it would use the money to instead reline the blast furnace at its Middletown, Ohio facility to extend their lifespan and continue their reliance on coal — which is clearly outside of the original scope of OCED funding for clean energy projects.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:40.477302

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former president Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said.

The U.S. Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What Has Been Cancelled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles, and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also cancelled prior to 2025.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The U.S. on the Global Stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy, withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, dismissing scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources, and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has proposed to include a CBAM in the new trading relationships his new government plans to negotiate with more reliable international partners.

The International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping, AP says, though the IMO’s record for delivery on its climate promises has been shaky at best.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan. Across the U.S., 24 Democrat-led states representing 50% of the country’s population and 60% of its GDP are recommitting to reducing their climate pollution and carrying on the energy transition.

But they can’t do it all on their own, and $4.5 billion in development was cancelled or delayed last month alone, according to E2’s tally.

This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.
This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories.
E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025.","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 kicked off a 10-year clean energy industrial policy in the United States, but it is now under threat of having core elements repealed via the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that has been approved by the House of Representatives and next faces a vote by the Senate.

Unprecedented announcements in U.S. clean energy followed the 2022 law. E2 tracks these announcements in its Clean Economy Works report. Since the IRA was passed, over 390 clean energy projects in 42 states representing over $130 billion in investment and 120,000 jobs have been announced, according to the report.

However, if the Senate passes the budget resolution as-written, core elements of the IRA, including the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, will be repealed for projects not placed in service by 2028. This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.

This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories. E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025. About $4.5 billion in cancellations occurred in April alone, said E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, director of communications, E2.

What’s more, most of the cancelled investments occurred in Republican districts. Democratic House members unanimously voted against the budget bill, but it was approved by a razor-thin majority due to strong Republican support.

More than $12 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican voting districts thus far, said E2. Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Timberlake.

Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

The cost of a U.S. House of Representatives bill to abruptly sunset clean energy tax credits could be significant in New York.

U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said the impact of the bill could reach a loss of more than 20,000 jobs and endanger $5 billion in clean manufacturing investments. It’s also expected to increase energy costs for American households by as much as 7%, while increasing pollution.

It’s also ceding ground in the renewable market to China, Schumer said, which produces a majority of the world’s solar panels and increased its solar capacity to 880 gigawatts in 2024. The bill passed the House in May and is now working its way through the U.S. Senate.

The $5 billion in investment coming to New York in wind, solar, battery, electric vehicle and other clean manufacturing was tied to Inflation Reduction Act funding.

“If they eliminate those tax credits, study after study shows we’ll have fewer companies coming here,” Schumer said. “Projects will be dramatically scaled back and up to 20,000 jobs would be lost in construction and manufacturing.”

Business and individual incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, including electric vehicle tax credits, are on the chopping block in the House bill.

Tech-neutral electricity tax credits have been the most affected, requiring a quick-turn on projects or risk losing funding. The House bill would require:

Repeal of credits for projects starting construction more than 60 days after enactment

Projects beginning within the 60-day period must be in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

The changes would exempt nuclear projects from the 60-day requirement, but would still need to be in service by the 2028 deadline.

Changes to solar credits for your home panels

It would also specifically eliminate credit for leased residential solar installations for any taxable year beginning after enactment. Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

Schumer blamed the fossil fuel lobby on the House vote in favor of the bill, despite the growing demand for electricity and the low startup costs of renewables like solar.

“The fossil fuel industry knows their days are numbered because the new kinds of clean power are … not only cleaner, but cheaper and quicker to implement,” the senator said. “And so they want to kill this industry just as it’s really getting started and causing job growth. That’s a damn disgrace.”

Schumer said he’s a supporter of bipartisan efforts to reform permit approvals for grid lines and pipelines to get energy from renewable energy installations to where people live.

“It’s too hard to build these power lines right now,” Schumer said. “So there’s bipartisan hope to pass this permitting reform and the tax credits go hand-in-hand with permitting reform.”","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/03/PROC/74290070007-sd-070224-hub-6.jpg?crop=4033,2267,x0,y240&width=3200&height=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 15:21:14.702517

The tech giant will support the early-stage development of three advanced nuclear energy sites from Elementl across the United States, each designed to deliver a minimum of 600 megawatts, for a combined capacity of 1.8 gigawatts.

Announced in early May, the agreement marks another inflection point in Google’s broader strategy to secure scalable, carbon-free baseload power capable of supporting the exponential energy demands of AI-centric data centers. The partnership also signals the sector's growing confidence in advanced nuclear technologies as a viable path to long-term sustainability and energy resilience in digital infrastructure.

Founded in 2022, Elementl Power aims to deploy over 10 gigawatts of advanced nuclear capacity by 2035. Google’s investment will fund key early-phase activities including site permitting, regulatory engagement, and commercial structuring. The backing of a hyperscale player like Google gives Elementl a formidable launch pad—and underscores the intensifying race among tech giants to lock in low-carbon power at scale.

As AI workloads push data center energy requirements to unprecedented levels, nuclear—once viewed as peripheral—is emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation power procurement strategies. With this move, Google isn’t just planning for the future; it's building it. The three Elementl facilities are expected to come online before the end of the decade, positioning Google to lead in deploying utility-scale nuclear energy for digital infrastructure.

Upon completion, Google will have the option to purchase power from these facilities. Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, reflecting on the importance of these types of investments, said:

Elementl Power Steps Into the Spotlight as a New Nuclear Catalyst

Founded just three years ago, Elementl Power is a relative newcomer to the nuclear energy landscape—but one with outsized ambition and strategic intent. Co-founder and President Ryan Mills describes the company as a purpose-built platform to address a critical industry gap: catalyzing private capital formation to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

According to Elementl’s mission statement, the company aims to bridge the divide between nuclear technology providers, utilities, and major energy buyers—entities increasingly seeking long-term, carbon-free baseload power as AI infrastructure scales globally.

While Elementl has yet to disclose detailed leadership bios or a track record of past projects, its high-profile partnership with Google is a significant validation. Beyond the investment itself, the collaboration gives Elementl a marquee partner and a proving ground for its “technology-agnostic” strategy—allowing it to source the most promising reactor designs tailored to individual site and grid requirements.

That flexibility may prove critical as the advanced nuclear sector works to commercialize a new generation of reactor technologies over the next decade.

With industry targets converging on the 2030–2035 window for the first wave of commercial deployment, Elementl’s ten-year runway is ambitious—but not implausible. Traditional nuclear development timelines often stretch 15 to 20 years; Elementl’s modular, adaptable approach offers a pragmatic counterpoint. Success will depend on navigating evolving regulatory frameworks, aligning with state-level energy policies, and keeping pace with innovation from a growing cohort of advanced reactor vendors. For Elementl, nimbleness may be as important as engineering.

Google’s Nuclear Playbook Extends Beyond Elementl

The Elementl deal builds on Google’s expanding footprint in nuclear innovation. In October 2024, the company signed a Master Plant Development Agreement with Kairos Power, a California-based startup focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs) using fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) technology. The agreement calls for the deployment of a fleet of Kairos reactors providing up to 500 megawatts of clean energy by 2035—an effort aimed squarely at meeting Google’s growing data center power demands with carbon-free baseload generation.

The first Kairos reactor is slated to go online by 2030, although full commercial deployment may extend several years beyond that. Still, the agreement marked a historic milestone: the first corporate commitment to procure energy from a network of SMRs, signaling a broader shift in how hyperscalers approach long-term energy procurement. Microsoft and Amazon have also engaged with next-gen nuclear developers through letters of intent, underscoring the rising stakes—and fierce competition—around securing future-proof power for data center growth.

Kairos Power, spun out of U.S. national laboratory and university research, has taken an iterative, vertically integrated approach to bring FHR technology to market. A key milestone came in December 2023, when the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a construction permit for Hermes, the company's low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

This was the first construction permit granted for a non-light-water reactor in the United States in more than 50 years. Construction began in July 2024, and by May 2025, the first safety-related concrete was poured—marking real progress on what could be a pivotal commercial validation.

Backed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, Kairos believes it is on track to commercialize its reactor platform in the early 2030s. If successful, projects like Hermes could shift the economics and timelines of nuclear deployment across the data center industry—transforming how digital infrastructure is powered in an era of escalating AI workloads and decarbonization mandates.

U.S. Nuclear Momentum Accelerates Amid Policy Shifts and Hyperscale Demand

Google’s nuclear partnerships with Elementl Power and Kairos Power underscore a broader resurgence in U.S. nuclear energy—driven by hyperscale computing needs, evolving federal policy, and a maturing ecosystem of advanced reactor technologies.

In late May 2025, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScale Power’s updated 77 MW small modular reactor (SMR) design, replacing its earlier 50 MW model. This milestone positions NuScale to potentially deploy its first SMR by decade’s end, contingent on securing a customer. Notably, NuScale is reportedly in discussions with five major data center operators, reflecting the sector’s growing interest in SMRs as scalable, carbon-free energy solutions.

Concurrently, President Trump’s administration has enacted a series of executive orders aimed at revitalizing the nuclear industry. These directives mandate expedited reactor licensing processes, authorize development on federal lands, and promote domestic uranium production. The policy shift has reportedly invigorated investor confidence, with companies like Oklo, Centrus Energy, and BWX Technologies experiencing significant stock gains.

The Department of Energy (DOE) is also advancing initiatives to bolster nuclear capacity. A comprehensive roadmap aims to add 35 GW of new capacity by 2035, with an annual addition of 15 GW by 2040. This plan includes repurposing existing power plant sites and transitioning coal plants to nuclear facilities.

In the private sector, tech giants are increasingly integrating nuclear energy into their infrastructure strategies.

The jury is still out on whether the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped contain or reduce inflation. Nevertheless, certain provisions have delivered tangible benefits that deserve closer examination before any potential repeal. While some provisions may not have broad appeal, one success of the IRA has been its impact on strengthening U.S. energy production. The bill speaks more to renewable energy innovation and increase in energy independence to support U.S. economic growth than to direct economic impact. Repealing it wholesale risks far more than we might anticipate.

At its core, the IRA tax credits for energy generation are driving significant investment in innovative energy production. Because renewable energy makes up around 21.4% of the energy mix, these incentives have been passed down the chain to the benefits of the ratepayer, while simultaneously sustaining the creation of entire industries. These investments have sparked construction and manufacturing jobs across both red and blue states, proving that clean energy isn’t just an environmental initiative.

These tax credits have also bolstered America’s energy independence. Renewables like solar, onshore wind and offshore wind are integral to our domestic energy supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources, and making our own infrastructure more resilient. They’ve also driven initiatives to improve long-term cost competitiveness, incentivizing developers to innovate to reduce costs.

Our current grid infrastructure and energy generation systems are nearing obsolescence and over the next decade the demand on these systems is expected to skyrocket. Data centers alone are expected to double their electricity demand, and by 2035, over 71 million electric vehicles will require around 400 kWh to charge per month. Urbanization trends are compounding this demand as more people move to cities.

Without the IRA tax credits, we risk slowing down our ability to develop more power generation, growing the risk of rolling blackouts and higher energy costs for the average ratepayer, all while increasing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Today’s decisions don’t impact today’s costs, they impact tomorrow’s ability to grow our economy.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the Internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Renewable energy is no exception.

Since the IRA has been enacted, the renewable energy industry has created thousands of jobs and established numerous domestic manufacturing plants on U.S. soil spurred by these domestic supply tax credit incentives. Manufacturing isn’t the only business reaping these benefits either. These credits have helped support better-paying jobs in specialized professions such as those in the maritime industry for offshore wind or wind technician positions.

Energy diversity isn’t just good economics — it’s a good security policy. With a diverse mix of energy sources (nuclear, fuel based, hydro, renewable), we reduce the risk of monopolies that drive up costs, as seen with Standard Oil’s monopoly in the early 20th century. Competition forces developers to lower costs, driving the cost of energy downwards. Furthermore, the energy has to come from somewhere and the question is not about the current costs of renewable energy but the future cost of energy in general to consumers without renewables in the energy mix of the future. There is nothing more damaging than energy you need but can’t find.

From a national security perspective, energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. If one source is cut off, others can fill the gap, ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing our reliance on adversarial nations for critical resources. Not only are we safer from attack, but we are also responsible for our own generation. This further helps reduce costs, but also prevents us from being beholden to other countries, especially our adversaries, for energy and tangential resources such as rare minerals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Hv8PCyQkZi0Q_aXEa5Bbam_cDvRz6BlNQ8WwJzkdND8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEyMTQ2Mzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:20.748405

Challenges were filed by Colorado’s Eagle County and several environmental organizations. The Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision that found “numerous [National Environmental Policy Act] NEPA violations arising from the EIS.”1

The 88-Mile Railroad Line

The Board, which reviews applications for new railroad lines, approved a proposal by a group of seven Utah counties (the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition) for the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah. The line would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network and would facilitate the transportation of crude oil from Utah to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere.

The Board’s Extraordinarily Lengthy EIS

The Board prepared what the Court referred to as “an extraordinarily lengthy EIS, spanning more than 3,600 pages of environmental analysis” addressing the environmental effects of the railroad line pursuant to NEPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit faulted the EIS for not sufficiently considering the “environmental effects of projects separate from the railroad line itself.” The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the environmental effects that should have been addressed in the EIS included these separate projects:

Increased oil drilling upstream in the Uinta Basin; and

Increased oil refining downstream along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.

Holding that the agency’s NEPA analysis was flawed, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Board’s EIS and the Board’s approval of the 88-mile railroad line. That decision further delayed the railroad’s construction even though the Board approved the project nearly four years earlier in December 2021.

Substantial Judicial Deference Required in NEPA Cases

Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered the unanimous 8-0 opinion of the Court2 ruling that:

First, the D.C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases.

Second, the D.C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue.

Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so. (Emphasis added.)

Upstream Oil Drilling and Other Speculative Projects Need Not Be Analyzed

The Court ruled that the Board’s decision was correct that analysis of the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling was not needed emphasizing that the project at issue was an “88-mile railroad line, not an oil well or a drilling permit in the Uinta Basin.” (Emphasis added.)

In addition, the Board possesses “no authority or control over potential future oil and gas development” in the Basin. Future projects would be “subject to the approval processes of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.”

The environmental effects of future oil and gas development in the Basin are “speculative” and attenuated from the project at hand.3

NEPA is Purely Procedural – an Agency’s Role – a Court’s Role

Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the need to distinguish the agency’s role from the court’s role. Courts should “defer to agencies’ decisions” about where to draw the line for:

How far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand; and

Whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.

Thus, agencies possess discretion and must have broad latitude to draw a “manageable line.”4

In an attempt to “tie all this together,” Justice Kavanaugh states:

When assessing significant environmental effects and feasible alternatives for purposes of NEPA, an agency will invariably make a series of fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry – and also about the length, content, and level of detail of the resulting EIS.

Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.

As the Court has emphasized on several occasions, and we doubly underscore again today, “inherent in NEPA . . . is a ‘rule of reason,’ which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any new potential information to the decision making process.”5 (Emphasis added.)

Delay Upon Delay – the Process Seems to “Border on the Kafkaesque.”

The Court’s critique of the history of NEPA implementation will perhaps reign in the extremes that project proponents have witnessed since President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970 – over 56 years ago. In his review, Justice Kavanaugh criticizes the tendency for agencies to engage in analysis of separate projects that address:

more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation. (Emphasis added.)

He cites the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Vermont Yankee: “Delay upon delay, so much so that the process sometimes seems to “borde[r] on the Kafkaesque.”6

And further:

A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development “under the guise” of just a little more process. . . .

A course correction of sorts is appropriate to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense. . . .

Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects.

On the contrary, as this Court has stressed, courts should and “must defer to ‘the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.’”7

The D.C. Circuit Was Wrong on the Merits of NEPA

Beyond requiring that courts defer to the informed discretion of the agency, the majority then addresses the failings of the D.C. Circuit Court’s rulings on the merits under NEPA stating:

The D.C. Circuit erroneously required the Board to address environmental effects from projects that are separate in time or place from the 88-mile railroad project at hand – that is, effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects. Moreover, those separate projects fall outside the Board’s authority and would be initiated, if at all, by third parties.

And to ensure that the reader understands the value of footnotes in the Court decision, footnote 5 deserves particular consideration:

Even though not mandated by NEPA to do so, the Board did identify some of the potential effects and marginal risks from projects separate from the 88 miles of additional railroad track in rural Utah. See, e.g., App. 354-358 (forecasting the number of oil wells that could be added in the Uinta Basin as a result of increased production spurred by the new railway); id., at 420-423, 539-542 (evaluating effects from increased oil refining along the Gulf Coast).

The Board should not necessarily earn bonus points for studying more than NEPA demanded. But it should definitely not receive a failing grade just because its 3,600-page EIS was less thorough in analyzing the effects from other projects than the Court of Appeals might have preferred. (Emphasis added.)

In summary:

The proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward. Courts should review an agency’s EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand.

The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.

In conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the EIS.

The Sotomayor Concurrence – the Agency’s Organic Statute and Case Precedent Control

Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her concurring opinion that took a different approach to reach the same conclusion as the majority. The concurring Justices relied on (1) the organic statute pursuant to which the agency acts (here the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, 49 U.S.C. §11101) and (2) earlier Court precedent. Agreeing that the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision was wrong, Justice Sotomayor states:

[U]nder its organic statute, the Board had no authority to reject petitioners’ application on account of the harms third parties would cause with products transported on the proposed railway. The majority takes a different path, unnecessarily grounding its analysis largely in matters of policy.

Justice Sotomayor reviewed the Board’s organic statute and confirmed the Board’s understanding of the scope of its review and the factors the Board must address in reviewing applications by project proponents stating:

As common carriers, railroads subject to the Board’s jurisdiction are required to provide ‘transportation or service on reasonable request’ to any person or commodity.” (49 U.S.C. §11101(a)). In addition, the Act contains a clear presumption in favor of approving new railways.

And of the 15 statutory policies the Board must consider in the exemption process, not one concerns the anticipated use of commodities that will be transported on the proposed railway. See §§10101(1)-(15).

Unlike the Board, meanwhile, other entities do have authority “to approve oil and gas development projects” and to regulate the effects of refining. . . . All this suggests, as the Board concluded, that the Board could not have rejected petitioners’ application in order to prevent the harmful effects of oil drilling and refining.

But the environmental respondents, although conceding that the Board correctly understood its authority to approve or disapprove a project application, argued that the Board should have analyzed environmental impacts that the Board could not lawfully prevent. Justice Sotomayor provided an unsympathetic dismissal of that argument concluding:

Public Citizen squarely forecloses that position. . . . Even a foreseeable environmental effect is outside of NEPA’s scope if the agency could not lawfully decide to modify or reject the proposed action on account of it. NEPA thus did not require the Board to consider the effects of oil drilling and refining.

Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible. Here, the Board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the Railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process. For that reason, I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the D.C. Circuit’s holding requiring the Board to consider in further detail harms caused by the oil industry.

Cumulative Impacts or Effects?

Those of us in the midst of dealing with federal agencies and those agencies’ NEPA obligations related to our projects will search in vain for any reference in either the majority or concurring opinions for any reference to “cumulative impacts” or “cumulative effects.” So, will a review of the Seven County decision at least indirectly provide some useful guidance? Maybe.

The NEPA statute itself does not use the terms “indirect” or “cumulative impacts or effects.” However, it has been generally understood for over 50 years that NEPA’s requirement that an EIS should discuss “the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” implies that the scope of an EIS is meant not only to consider the immediate effects of a project but also how a project might impact the environment in the long-term through indirect or cumulative effects with other projects.

Although NEPA does not use the terms explicitly, the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) were the first to address federal agency responsibility to consider indirect and cumulative impacts and to document that analysis.8

And despite recent court decisions and the Trump Administration’s actions that eliminate the CEQ rules9, every federal agency (including the Surface Transportation Board) has promulgated their own NEPA regulations that require analysis of direct and indirect impacts in their environmental reviews.10

Consider the discussion above as a prelude to our interest in reviewing the Seven County decision to find further guidance as to whether and how federal agencies will now address “cumulative impacts” of our projects. The underlying facts of the case might appear to automatically involve the need to assess cumulative environmental impacts of constructing and operating a new rail line – impacts beyond “just” the rail line itself.

Indeed, what is the “need” for the rail line? The answer: oil development! Without the need to transport oil to the “main rail lines” and distant refineries, there is no need for the line. So, how does one disengage the impacts of one from the impacts of the other?

That’s exactly what the opponents of the rail line argued. For example, the Brief of Respondents Eagle County, Colorado and Center for Biological Diversity, et al in Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari states in part:

Limiting agencies to effects that they directly regulate, rather than effects Congress has authorized them to consider, does not comport with NEPA’s purpose or rule of reason – “that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any potential information in the decision-making process.”

Both the majority and concurring opinions limit the agency’s obligation, however, to a review of the application of the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition for an 88-mile railroad – not the arguably “cumulative impacts” and “indirect impacts” that might occur with further oil and gas development in the Uinta Basin. And it is the underlying “organic statute” that provides the authority for this particular agency to do anything that drives the result.

In sum, these are the factors that we, our project proponents, and the federal agencies involved must consider.

Has the federal agency undertaking the NEPA analysis acted within the scope of authority Congress provided in its “organic” statute?

Has the agency incorrectly considered projects that are separate in time or place from the proposed project?

Because the textual focus of NEPA is the “proposed action” – the project at hand – not other separate projects, has the agency gone too far in addressing those separate projects?

Has the agency addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives to the relevant project?

Is the agency’s final decision reasonably explained?

And finally, while indirect environmental effects of the project may fall within NEPA’s scope (even if they might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or materialize later in time), the fact that the project might foreseeably lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project does not mean the agency must consider that separate project’s environmental effects.

Among the 24 axed awards was a hydrogen energy initiative led by Exxon Mobil in Baytown, Texas, and several decarbonization projects for the cement sector and for the food and beverage industry, including the Kraft Heinz Co.

Of the canceled grants, only $99 million had gone out the door, DOE said. The majority of the contracts were signed by the Biden DOE after Donald Trump won the presidency last November, the department said.

DOE’s list shows award cancellations for projects that are mostly in Republican-leaning states — Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, Ohio and Alabama — and for industries that have voiced support for Trump.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

He added, “the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars.”

The department says it used a review process announced earlier this month to cancel the awards, deciding the grants “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment.”

Democratic lawmakers, environmentalists, energy efficiency groups and some manufacturing advocates panned the grant cancellations.

“We’re ceding ground to global competitors racing ahead in innovation and energy efficiency,” Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said in a statement.

“The American people deserve leadership that meets the moment — not one that backs away from the challenge of a clean, affordable energy future. If the Trump Administration was looking to give Communist China everything they wanted, they are well on their way,” said Kaptur, the ranking member of the House Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over DOE.

The largest canceled awards are for carbon capture projects at cement plants. Heidelberg Materials received $500 million for a project, and the National Cement Co. of California won an award for the same amount.

An $189 million award for cement company Brimstone Energy was also canceled. Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin said the company believes the decision to cancel was based on a “misunderstanding,” given the “project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.”

“Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Darwin said in a statement.

Erin Glabets, spokesperson for Sublime Systems, which had an $87 million cement grant canceled, said the company was “surprised and disappointed.”

Heidelberg Materials spokesperson David Perkins said in an interview, “DOE indicates this decision can be appealed.”

“We are in the process of evaluating this course as we consider our next steps,” he said.

Meanwhile, natural gas plants appear to be big targets for the cancellations.

Among DOE’s award cancellations is one for a gas-fired power plant in Kentucky, which DOE selected last February for a federal cost share of $72 million. The Cane Run Generating Station intended to install CCS and trap roughly 200 tons of carbon dioxide per day.

Power generator Calpine and its carbon capture projects also took a hit. On the list of cancellations was a $270 million award to Calpine Texas CCUS Holdings for the company’s project in Baytown, Texas.

A $332 million canceled award for Exxon Mobil was for a project that planned to swap out natural gas for hydrogen at a textile and plastic production site in Baytown. At the time of the Biden award announcement, DOE said the project would avoid 2.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, along with roughly 200 tons per year of nitrogen oxide.

Exxon declined to comment.

Another axed award, for just over $49 million, was headed to a carbon capture pilot at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, which is outside of the Dry Fork power station in Gillette, Wyoming. That award was also announced in February 2024.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition — a group that works to build policy support for greater deployment of carbon management technologies — said DOE’s decision to cancel awards is “hugely disappointing.”

“Businesses require certainty to plan and execute projects, and carbon management is no different,” Stolark said in a statement. “For decades, the United States has been the global leader in the development and deployment of carbon management technologies but moves like this risk ceding America’s energy and technological leadership to other nations. As the policy framework in other nations for carbon management continues to mature, we risk being left behind.”

Trump has pledged to revive American manufacturing with a sweeping package of import tariffs. Tariffs implemented under the president’s declared emergency last month are now stuck in a legal limbo, after a federal court decision Wednesday striking down the levies was followed by an appeals court allowing the tariffs to stay in place while appeals play out.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said of the canceled DOE awards. “Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”

Nadel called the DOE decision “shortsighted.”

EPA promotes carbon capture

DOE’s award terminations contrast with EPA efforts to speed up permitting of wells used to sequester heat-trapping carbon dioxide deep into underground formations.

Earlier this year, EPA granted top regulatory authority over Class VI wells, to the state of West Virginia. It also recently proposed granting that authority — called “primacy” — to Arizona for all six classes of injection wells, including Class VI.

“EPA received a complete Class VI primacy application from Texas on February 28, 2025,” EPA spokesperson Carolyn Holran said in a statement Thursday.

The agency “is working expeditiously to propose and then finalize this rulemaking. EPA’s goal is to support a timely and efficient primacy decision that protects groundwater resources and supports cooperative federalism,” Holran said.

The list didn’t include some of the largest projects — such as hydrogen hubs — potentially slated for cancellation at DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, according to documents that have been circulating among DOE officials and lobbyists for weeks.

It’s possible that those other projects may be terminated later, as Wright has said DOE is conducting a broad review of projects to be completed this summer. According to the documents, four of seven hydrogen hubs funded with $7 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law may be on the chopping block.

The 24 projects nixed Friday were on the circulating lists.

OCED also is facing a staffing plunge. More than 70 percent of employees have opted to leave the office voluntarily as part of a deferred resignation program. The department has not provided a final tally of how many resignation offers have been approved.

According to modeling from the environmental think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the closure of OCED could result in the loss of more than 290,000 jobs.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/63/ae/f154bca745c494039412b11694bc/senate-energy-82284.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:23:43.684849

Businesses have canceled or delayed some $14-billion worth of clean energy projects just since January, alongside some 10,000 announced jobs, according to a new analysis by business and advocacy group E2. Furthermore, if Trump’s tax and spending bill passes into law, E2 anticipates steeper losses.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” E2 communications director Michael Timberlake said in a statement.

E2 tracks private investments and job creation that have been announced in the clean energy industry since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The organization tallies projects in manufacturing, R&D, and electricity generation, as well as recycling, repair, and maintenance projects. Sectors E2 follows include batteries, EVs, hydrogen, semiconductors, solar, and wind. Since the bill’s 2022 passage, E2 notes some 390 projects, worth some $132 billion, have been announced, along with roughly 123,000 jobs.

E2 notes that Republican-run congressional districts have reaped the majority of benefits: 61 percent of projects, 72 percent of jobs, and 82 percent of investment. As a result, Republican districts are also taking a majority of the losses, to the tune of some $12 billion in project cancellations and 13,000 canceled jobs.

Some Republican lawmakers have begun sounding the alarm on the version of Trump’s bill that passed the House, which restricts the ability for clean energy producers of wind and solar to access credits but carves out exceptions for nuclear power, Politico reported last week. Five Senate Republicans told Politico they plan to consider changes to the House’s version of the bill, with Finance Committee member Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) saying, “Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Trump’s former top adviser, Elon Musk, has similarly expressed distaste with provisions in the bill that would at the close of the year terminate EV incentives worth up to $7,500—including for Tesla models. It’s a change in tune for the Tesla CEO, who previously seemed to endorse erasure of the incentives as beneficial to Tesla. Musk announced his official departure from White House duties on Wednesday.

Tesla’s energy division, which sells solar supplies and battery storage, is similarly at risk from the planned repeal of residential solar credits and phaseout of clean energy investment incentives.

Commenting on an X user’s post that referred to the bill’s removal of solar energy credits as “unjust,” Musk wrote, “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

Musk also shared a post from Tesla Energy, urging the Senate “to enact legislation with a sensible wind down” of credits for residential solar and low carbon electricity, rather than “abruptly ending the energy tax credits” in order to support grid integrity, domestic manufacturing, and AI.

What could change, however, is the permitting process for fossil fuel projects. The current version of Trump’s bill contains provisions seeking to streamline and expedite that process, Politico reported, but that component may not make it through the Senate.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/05/trump-cuts-climate-tech-projects-inc.jpg",N,,2025-05-30 16:09:58.281386

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds.

Elegant, advanced interior

The order set off a panicked evacuation of staff and patients at the Al-Awda Hospital, which was the last functioning hospital in the region. Health officials say Israeli attacks on hospitals have killed more than 1,400 medical workers since October 2023.

On Thursday, Israeli attacks across Gaza killed at least 70 Palestinians; airstrikes since dawn today have killed a further 18 people, according to Gaza hospital officials. Al Jazeera reports Israeli troops shot and wounded 20 Palestinians trying to reach an aid distribution point set up by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. It’s the third aid center set up by the group so far. The United Nations has said the foundation’s decision to open a handful of aid hubs exclusively in the south of the Gaza Strip puts civilian lives in danger and encourages mass displacement by using aid as “bait.”

Gaza’s food crisis continues to worsen, as the trickle of aid now entering the territory is far too little for its population of over 2 million people. This is Khawla Abu Zeitar, mother of an 11-month-old child suffering from malnutrition, who said she did not manage to get a meal after waiting in line at a soup kitchen in Gaza City Wednesday.

Khawla Abu Zeitar: “This boy is suffering from extreme malnutrition. … The average weight for his age is 12 kilograms. Now he only weighs 3.9 kilograms. He has been granted a medical evacuation 20 days ago, but I’m still waiting.”

On Thursday, the White House said Israel had agreed to a U.S.-crafted Gaza ceasefire proposal and that Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had submitted it to Hamas. Drop Site News reports the deal includes a 60-day initial truce, a “redeployment” of some Israeli occupation forces, and an exchange of captives, including 10 living Israelis held in Gaza. It would also require the “immediate” delivery of humanitarian aid, including by the United Nations and the Red Crescent. Hamas officials said they were studying the deal, but a member of the group’s political bureau told Reuters the proposal in its current form would result in “the continuation of killing and famine” in Gaza.

Saudi Arabia’s defense minister warned leaders of Iran last month that they should accept President Trump’s offer to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with the U.S. — or face military action by Israel. That’s according to Reuters, which reports Saudi Prince Khalid bin Salman personally delivered the message that Trump’s team would want to reach a deal quickly, that the window for diplomacy would close fast, and that an Israeli attack was possible if the talks broke down. Khalid bin Salman’s visit to Iran in April was the first by a high-ranking member of the Saudi royal family in more than two decades.

A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily reinstated Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, staying a decision by a trade court that had blocked those tariffs one day earlier after finding Trump overstepped presidential authority by invoking emergency powers. Prior to Thursday’s stay, another federal court, this time in Washington, D.C., had also blocked Trump’s tariffs. The case is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court. Trump’s trade war has roiled global markets and already cost companies $34 billion, according to Reuters. A number of smaller businesses have been forced to shutter. We’ll have more on this story with the Brennan Center’s Elizabeth Goitein later in the broadcast.

The founder of the private mercenary firm Blackwater is working with Haiti’s interim government on a plan to conduct lethal operations against the gangs that now control much of Haiti’s territory. The New York Times reports Erik Prince recently shipped a large supply of weapons to Haiti and is planning to send up to 150 mercenaries there this summer. Prince is reportedly part of a secret task force that has spent the past several weeks operating drones meant to kill gang members. A Haitian human rights group blames the drones for the deaths of over 200 people.

The daughter of a woman who died during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave is suing seven oil and gas companies for her mother’s wrongful death. Juliana Leon died of hyperthermia, or overheating, as a “heat dome” choked the region and sent temperatures in Seattle skyrocketing to 108 degrees. Nearly 200 people died during the heat wave. The lawsuit is the first of its kind and accuses the fossil fuel companies of concealing their role in creating the climate crisis and failing to warn people of the dangers of their emissions.

This comes as a new report today found half the world population endured 30 additional days of extreme heat over the past year due to human-created climate change.

The Supreme Court has sharply limited the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, a ruling that will accelerate the development of major infrastructure projects including highways, pipelines and liquefied natural gas export terminals. The court’s 8-0 ruling on Thursday will allow federal agencies conducting environmental reviews to take a more limited view of the impacts of major transportation and energy projects. Earthjustice said in a statement, “The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.”

A court in Germany ruled against a Peruvian farmer who was seeking redress from the energy company RWE for its role in the melting of Andean glaciers, which has put the farmer and his community in Huaraz at risk of flooding. But climate activists are celebrating the ruling as a major victory, as the German court also found major polluters can be held responsible for the consequences of climate change, setting up a possible precedent as similar cases play out in other countries. This is German lawyer Roda Verheyen, who represented Saúl Luciano Lliuya in the landmark case.

Roda Verheyen: “But what is important is the legal obligation of companies like RWE has been established here today. The legal obligation to deal with the consequences of their actions and to bear responsibility for them is something that has never before been established anywhere in the world in this form.”

A major report on chronic health conditions by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was found to contain citations to nonexistent studies. According to the outlet NOTUS, the 73-page “Make America Healthy Again” document contains references to at least seven fabricated studies, while other studies are misinterpreted.

This comes as the Health Department has just canceled a $600 million contract with Moderna to develop mRNA vaccines protecting against flu subtypes which could develop into pandemics, including bird flu. RFK Jr. has expressed skepticism over mRNA technology, which was used in COVID vaccines that are widely credited with saving millions of lives and preventing millions of cases of severe disease.

Here in New York, a judge extended a temporary restraining order protecting Columbia University student Yunseo Chung from deportation until a hearing on June 5. Chung, a South Korean national, is a green card holder who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7. She’s been targeted by immigration authorities for participating in Palestinian rights protests at Columbia. Community members rallied in support of Chung as her lawyers appeared in court Thursday. This is Yunmi from the group Nodutdol.

Yunmi: “She’s being attacked because she has views that go against the Trump administration and their desires in Israel and also against the general ruling class. So, by persecuting her on also baseless grounds — there’s no evidence against her — who can say what the Trump administration and the federal government are willing to do next to anyone, regardless of their immigration status?”

The renowned Kenyan author, playwright and professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has died at the age of 87. Over six decades, he chronicled Kenya’s transition from a British colony to independence. Thiong’o’s work landed him in jail and in exile as he wrote searing criticisms of colonial rule, as well as the emerging independent state, which he accused of benefiting elites at the expense of Kenyan society. In 2010, Democracy Now! interviewed him in our studio after he’d just released his memoir, “Dreams in a Time of War.”

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: “In all the settler colonies, like Kenya, Nigeria — not Nigeria — Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe — Mozambique is another example, Algeria is another example — independence was won through armed struggle. In all of those, there was armed liberation movements, and the land question was at the basis of the whole struggle. So, with Kenya, we had one of the earliest anti-colonial guerrilla movements. Ours was by the name of Mau Mau.”

While BEVs use charged battery packs, hydrogen fuel cell EVs generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The only byproducts are water vapor and warm air, making them a zero-emission alternative to gas-powered cars.

Instead of a lithium-ion battery pack, hydrogen cars rely on electricity from the hydrogen-oxygen reaction to power their motors. However, hydrogen vehicles still face major hurdles before achieving mass adoption. Toyota is the only automaker to make a notable investment in them, though its efforts haven’t gained much traction in the market.

Most automakers prioritized BEVs, and many drivers haven’t heard of hydrogen-powered vehicles or the environmental benefits they offer. Furthermore, hydrogen cars have yet to prove their effectiveness compared to BEVs and gas-powered vehicles.

Still, many auto industry leaders believe hydrogen technology could play a key role in long-haul transport and certain commercial applications. Toyota emphasizes that hydrogen cars serve specific needs. According to the company’s Mobility Communication Consultant Josh Burns, a customer’s budget, lifestyle, and available infrastructure will determine whether hydrogen or battery electric makes more sense.

Though hydrogen cars emit no pollutants, their sustainability depends on how the hydrogen is produced. Clean hydrogen, derived from renewable sources, is essential if hydrogen vehicles are to be considered truly green.

One of the biggest upsides of hydrogen vehicles is convenience. Refueling takes as little as five minutes, much faster than charging most BEVs, and the process is just as easy as filling up a gas tank. Hydrogen cars also offer more consistent performance over time since they don’t rely on batteries that degrade with age.

A typical hydrogen vehicle can travel around 400 miles on a single tank, comparable to or better than many electric cars. However, hydrogen fuel is more expensive than gasoline or electricity, and the limited number of refueling stations restricts where these vehicles can realistically operate.

Because of this, hydrogen car owners must plan their routes carefully. Drivers outside areas with hydrogen infrastructure, mostly in California, Japan, and a few parts of Europe, simply don’t have the option of owning one.

While hydrogen fuel cell vehicles remain a niche market today, their fast refueling, long range, and zero emissions keep them in the conversation about the future of clean transportation, especially for uses where battery electric vehicles may fall short.

As HFCEV technology is further developed, it will have to prove itself against competition from fossil-fueled vehicles and EVs from various manufacturers like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO).

GM originally estimated 440 miles of range for the 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, but real-world tests yielded over 500 miles on a charge. That's not bad for an 8,800-pound truck on 24-inch wheels in normal driving conditions. Now, the 2026 model is coming around, and GMC has released the EPA estimated range figures for its Max Range versions of the Sierra EV trims. If you buy the right trim, you can get up to 478 miles of range. Not in a slickly aerodynamic Lucid Air sedan. In a full-size pickup truck.

Quietly Becoming The Class Leader

It seems that the Sierra EV hasn't had a lot of headlines despite having a reasonable entry price of $64,495 and a brutal amount of power available with the range – up to 760 horsepower (Denali Max Range) with 785 lb-ft of torque. Now, GMC is happy to show off the Sierra's 2026 EPA-estimated long-range numbers (the Max Range option), and it opens with the Sierra EV Elevation boasting 410 miles. However, the Sierra EV AT4 and Sierra EV Denali are showing off an estimated 478 miles of range – 38 miles more than the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 that impressed so much and 18 miles more than the Denali's maximum for 2025.

With a GM-estimated 478 miles of range, the Sierra EV AT4 with available Max Range can travel from Los Angeles to Phoenix, San Francisco to Santa Barbara or New York City to Virginia Beach on a full charge. This surpasses the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck to stand out in the all-electric truck market.

– GMC

As you can see above, GMC isn't afraid of throwing some shade at Ford, Rivian, and Tesla over this. In reality, going so nuts for range doesn't make a huge amount of logical sense. Most people don't travel more than an average of 40 miles a day, although work trucks can easily average a hundred miles a day. While people will occasionally make 400-mile journeys, that's an awful lot of battery to carry around daily for those occasions. However, range anxiety isn't logical, but it is very real, and getting caught on a journey with no chargers around or only broken chargers isn't fun.

A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

The Permitting Technology Action Plan provides a government-wide strategy to optimize technology to effectively and efficiently evaluate environmental permits, allowing for seamless information exchange between agencies, simplified interactions for applicants, and greater transparency and predictability on environmental review and permitting schedules for sponsors and stakeholders.

The Permitting Technology Action Plan contains:

Minimum functional requirements for environmental review and permitting systems;

An initial National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and permitting data and technology standard;

A timeline and implementation roadmap for agencies; and

A governance structure for implementation.

This Permitting Technology Action Plan is a testament to the Trump Administration’s commitment to expediting and simplifying the environmental review and permitting process. It delivers on President Trump’s Memorandum, Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century, and follows the establishment of the Permitting Innovation Center. Working with the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, the CEQ-led Permitting Innovation Center will design and test prototype permitting technology systems in order to advise Federal agencies on the adoption of the best-in-class-tools.

“The Trump Administration is working tirelessly to implement innovation-driven environmental review and permitting reforms to eliminate needless delays that cripple the growth of the U.S. economy, replacing outdated technology with efficient, speedier solutions,” said Katherine Scarlett, Chief of Staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through interagency coordination, this Administration has taken bold action to streamline the NEPA process and get America back to building infrastructure projects of all kinds.”

“Under President Trump’s leadership, we will ensure the Federal government is maximizing modern technologies to streamline permitting,” said Thomas Shedd, Technology Transformation Services Director at the General Services Administration. “Technology Transformation Services remains committed to supporting the execution of the Permitting Technology Action Plan by building the tools agencies can use to accelerate their environmental review and permitting processes – with results in weeks or months, not years.”

The solutions laid out in the Permitting Technology Action Plan will leverage technology to tackle longstanding problems identified in CEQ’s E-NEPA Report to Congress—including, reliance on outdated systems, fragmented data management, and disconnected digital tools—reinforcing this Administration’s unwavering dedication to deliver outstanding results at 21st century speeds.

In Case You Missed It: President Trump Unleashes Permitting Technology for the 21st Century

“We need to drill more, map more, mine more, and build more — all while innovating faster than our global competitors,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The Permitting Technology Action Plan will channel our greatest asset, American innovation and technology, to overhaul our current permitting process and power our nation faster, better, cleaner, and more reliably than ever before. Embracing cutting-edge development and modernizing this outdated system will pave the way to American success.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, this administration is taking action to fix a broken system that’s slowing down critical energy projects across the country. Outdated permitting systems are creating costly delays at the exact moment we need to be expanding capacity, strengthening our energy security, and building the infrastructure that powers American industry and lowers costs for families,” said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “As Secretary of Energy and Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, I welcome this decisive action to modernize permitting technology, cut red tape, and align the full force of the federal government behind getting these essential projects approved and built—because energy dominance isn’t possible without the infrastructure to support it.”

“When President Trump says American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of our economy for centuries, he means it. For too long, our producers have experienced delays and uncertainty as they navigate a complex permitting process that gets in the way of American innovation and stifles energy and timber production. This historic Memorandum will increase efficiency and transparency so farmers, foresters, and producers can get back to the work they do every day to feed, fuel, and clothe our nation,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

“It takes too long to build in America,” said Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy. “Ridiculous red tape and outdated regulations add cost and delays to projects. It has to stop. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are slashing the bureaucracy and getting back to actually building things in America again. We are doing that by harnessing innovative technology to expedite the permitting process.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:28:38.203682

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles.

Over the past few months, the Texas Senate passed three bills that could’ve devastated the state’s nation-leading renewable energy rollout — but clean energy appears to have dodged the bullet.

The first of those bills would establish new fees, setback requirements, and other permitting regulations on utility-scale wind and solar development, even though fossil-fuel plants don’t face the same restrictions. The second would require large renewables installations to buy gas generation as a backup.

And the third would ensure all renewable power development came with a side of fossil fuels, as it directed that 50% of all new power plant capacity added to the state’s grid come from dispatchable resources other than battery storage. That would have amounted to a gas mandate: Since solar panels and wind turbines can only produce power under certain conditions (sun shining, wind blowing, you know the drill), they can only be dispatchable power sources if batteries are involved. An earlier version of the bill explicitly said 50% of new capacity would have to come from gas.

These bills would have seriously slowed Texas’ deployment of solar, batteries, and wind power, which are shattering power-generation records in the state and helping its grid withstand extreme weather and meet surging electricity demand. The legislation would have caused reliability to fall and utility bills to soar, according to an April report from Aurora Energy Research.

But the Texas House’s session is set to end on June 2, and none of those three bills have been scheduled for consideration. This doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t resurface at some point, but they’re at least dead as standalone bills for this session, Doug Lewin writes in his Texas Energy and Power newsletter.

There are growing signs that these sorts of restrictions on renewables aren’t popular among many Texas Republicans and business interests. Recent polling from Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation shows widespread Republican support for renewables, while even the Texas Oil and Gas Association allied with renewable power generators to oppose the state House’s companion to the Senate’s bill requiring gas backup for clean energy.

Similar efforts in the state were defeated two years ago as well.

More big energy stories

DOE orders a coal plant to stay open

The Trump administration took its pro-coal agenda to a new level last Friday, ordering a retiring Michigan coal plant to stay open through at least the end of August. The J.H. Campbell plant was supposed to shut down tomorrow, and Michigan utility Consumers Energy had been working since at least 2021 to do so. But the administration contended that the Midwest faces an ​“energy emergency” and needs the plant to guarantee power reliability.

Clean energy advocates, consumer watchdogs, and even Michigan’s top energy regulator disagree. ​“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps said in a statement. ​“The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses across the Midwest.”

Trump’s nuclear orders probably won’t outweigh cuts

President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders late last week to boost nuclear power — though they probably won’t counteract his many moves to weaken the industry. The four orders will:

Expedite nuclear reactor testing at federal labs, with a goal of approving three new designs by next year.

Slash regulations for building nuclear reactors on federal lands.

Speed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s reviews of reactor licenses.

Boost uranium mining and enrichment.

But in recent months, the Trump administration has also looked to reduce funding for the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, and cut staff at the Loan Programs Office, even though it funds nuclear reactor projects. And though nuclear made out better than other low-carbon energy sources in the federal budget bill recently passed by the House, projects would only be eligible for tax credits if they start construction by 2028 — an ambitious timeline for a famously slow-to-build energy source. Those are big setbacks that won’t ​“magically be solved” by simply cutting red tape, Josh Freed, who heads the climate and energy program at that think tank Third Way, told Latitude Media.

The Detroit District is inviting the public and concerned parties to participate in a 30-day public comment period, which runs from May 30 to June 30, 2025. Comments can be submitted through several methods, including the , virtual public meetings, and written submissions.

Virtual public meetings are scheduled for Wednesday, June 18, 2025, from 1 to 4 p.m., and Wednesday, June 25, 2025, from 5 to 8 p.m. Written comments must be postmarked by June 30, 2025, and sent to Line 5 Tunnel EIS, 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

""Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,"" Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains ""an existential threat.""

""Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,"" the group said. ""We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.""

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

""My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it's prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation.

Since its passage in 1969, NEPA has been weaponized by environmental groups to stunt disfavored projects—which has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects.
The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Utah railroad project on Thursday, setting a precedent that could make it easier to build things in the United States.

The case at hand—Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County—involved an 88-mile-long railroad track in an oil-rich and rural area of Utah. The project would have connected this area to the national rail network, making it easier and more efficient to transport crude oil extracted in the region to refineries in Gulf Coast states.

In 2020, a group of seven Utah counties known as the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition submitted its application to the federal Surface Transportation Board (STB) for the project. During its review process, the board conducted six public meetings and collected over 1,900 comments to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS)—which is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—that spanned over 3,600 pages. The board approved the project's construction in 2021.

Before construction could begin, however, Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups filed suit, challenging the STB's approval. Specifically, this coalition argued that the STB did not consider the downstream environmental effects of the project—such as increased oil drilling in Utah and refining in the Gulf Coast. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs and vacated the railroad's construction approval.

In an 8–0 decision on Thursday (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case), the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling.

In its majority opinion, authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Court clarified that under NEPA the STB ""did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects."" The Court concluded that the ""proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward: Courts should review an agency's EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand. The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.""

This statement ""is particularly significant for infrastructure projects, such as pipelines or transmission lines, and should help reduce NEPA's burdens (at least at the margins),"" wrote Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, in The Volokh Conspiracy. ""The opinion will also likely hamper any future efforts, perhaps by Democratic administrations, to expand or restore more fulsome (and burdensome) NEPA requirements.""

One recent example is former President Joe Biden, who finalized rules requiring federal agencies to consider a project's impacts on climate change—a global issue that is incredibly complex and hard to forecast—in their NEPA analyses. The Trump administration recently rescinded this requirement.

Kavanaugh's opinion also clarified that courts should ""afford substantial deference"" to federal agencies in their EIS reviews and ""should not micromanage"" agency choices ""so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

This point could reduce one of the largest delays caused by NEPA: litigation. Since its passage in 1969, NEPA has been weaponized by environmental groups to stunt disfavored projects—which has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects. On average, these challenges delay a permitted project's start time by 4.2 years, according to The Breakthrough Institute.

The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews. With courts deferring more to agency decisions, litigation could be settled more quickly.

""NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,"" wrote Kavanaugh. ""All of that has led to more agency analysis of separate projects, more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/02/dreamstime_l_12184614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:22:52.726322

The Stellantis NV brand showed off the exterior of the new-look Cherokee for the first time Thursday in several images and a video. Long a best-seller for Jeep, the new model has a more boxy appearance than the prior generation. It will also come with a traditional hybrid gas-electric option that the brand hasn't offered before. Until now, Jeep has been focused on its plug-in hybrid offerings and early this year released its first all-electric SUV, the Wagoneer S.

Jeep said the SUV is set to arrive late in 2025 after executives initially had stated it was expected midway through the year. The prior generation of Cherokee ran from model year 2014 until it ended production at the automaker's Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois in early 2023.

""Jeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream lineup,"" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement.

Dealers have eagerly awaited the new Cherokee and expressed frustration that the company didn't fill the lineup gap sooner. The Cherokee historically sold in large numbers — sometimes over 200,000 units a year in the United States over the past decade — and the midsize SUV segment in general is highly popular among American consumers.

In terms of pricing, the new Cherokee will sit somewhere between the entry-level Compass, which starts below $30,000, and the larger and more luxurious Grand Cherokee, with a starting price under $40,000.

The new Cherokee is expected to be built at the automaker's Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions LLC. That is also where the electric Wagoneer S is made, and it also is expected to eventually manufacture a third midsize Jeep SUV, the electric Recon, which is also set to come out in late 2025.

The Cherokee, like the other SUVs coming from Toluca, will be built on the STLA Large platform, a vehicle underpinning that Stellantis has said allows it to offer a range of options, from gas, to hybrid, to full electric. A Jeep spokesperson, Sean Szymkowski, declined to say what other propulsion options could eventually be available for the Cherokee beyond the hybrid.

Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said Thursday that the automaker planned to roll out hybrid technology similar to that of the Cherokee in other models soon. He noted other automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. have seen big success in recent years with their hybrid offerings.

The battery maker had been in talks with several major backers, including Scania, in search of a buyer this spring.
Truck and bus maker Scania has been one of Northvolt’s biggest backers, but its appetite for taking over the battery maker has not been high.
Another shift on the horizon is the expected arrival of solid-state battery tech that could once again upend the battery industry as demand for raw materials and technology shifts.
Northvolt's accelerating decline in Sweden is viewed as closing some doors long-term on the potential of battery production in northern Europe as a whole.","Northvolt's operations in Sweden are in danger of winding down as the battery maker navigates bankruptcy.

The company has been seeking to stem its cashflow over the past year by closing some units, but a takeover by an automaker has been elusive in Europe.

EV makers continue to be wary of battery production footprints on the continent.

A couple of short years ago, Northvolt was on a factory building spree with battery orders from several major automakers, including truck maker Scania.

Now, the company's assets are being liquidated at auction, and production could cease in a matter of months if a buyer is not found.

The battery startup enjoyed a momentous rise early in the decade, fueled by a consumer rush into EVs at the start of the pandemic.

The company seemingly faced no shortage of demand for EV batteries as Europe's automakers raced to quickly develop and field new electric models, favoring buyers in Europe if not always North America.

What went wrong?

In short, Northvolt expanded too quickly while also facing construction delays and production bottlenecks, which limited its revenue.

The battery startup was also caught between two different business environments in the EV sector, with its building boom having been fueled by a tide of EV optimism of the late 2010s and early 2020s that had quickly faded by 2023.

The battery maker had been in talks with several major backers, including Scania, in search of a buyer this spring.

Truck and bus maker Scania has been one of Northvolt’s biggest backers, but its appetite for taking over the battery maker has not been high.

But by the end of March it became apparent that no large purchaser was willing to step in, with the EV industry now facing a less certain outlook than just a couple of years prior.

Northvolt's US arm had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after a series of emergency cost-cutting measures, including the brisk closures of several research units.

But the cost-cutting measures were not enough to right the ship by spring 2025, as construction delays at plants on the other side of the Atlantic had continued to consume its cash reserves.

In March, Northvolt had filed for bankruptcy in Sweden as well, citing sudden shifts in demand, rising capital costs, production challenges, and geopolitical instability, among other factors.

Northvolt’s crisis has already delivered a significant blow to Europe’s EV sector.

Still, the company had maintained its operations during the last few months, even as bankruptcy proceedings unfolded.

""We ramped up production to meet customers' needs, reduced operational cash outflow by 55%, made tough decisions to pause or delay expansion plans, completed divestitures, and ultimately delivered our first one million battery cells to a European customer,"" Tom Johnstone, Interim Chairman of Northvolt's Board of Directors said in March.

In April, the company's sites and equipment from the Northvolt Ett gigafactory for various stages of the battery manufacturing process (valued at €300 million) were being sold in what is one of the continent's largest-ever bankruptcy auctions.

The sale was being handled by TBAuctions under the direction of bankruptcy trustee Jonas Premfors from law firm DLA Piper, and all the equipment needed for battery production has been put up for sale to the highest bidder.

""With some of the most cutting-edge technology and unique assets, it not only marks a significant moment for the industry but also contributes to the circular economy by giving this business equipment a second life,"" said Tom Christenson, CEO of TBAuctions.

The auction company noted that most of the equipment has never been unpacked and is in unused condition.

But with EV demand having taken a hit, coupled with the steady rise of battery makers in Asia, very few companies are looking to replicate what Northvolt has been doing in Europe, cognizant of the business pressures it faced.

Buying Northvolt's assets to start production again, therefore, does not immediately promise a vastly different result to potential buyers, even if the equipment and sites could be bought at a bargain.

From a broader perspective, Northvolt's crisis and ongoing decline has already delivered a significant blow to Europe's EV sector amid plenty of instability in the industry, while highlighting the fragile nature of the battery business, which now appears pointed almost entirely toward production in Asia.

And few companies in Europe are in the mood to compete cost-wise with off-the-shelf battery packs they could source elsewhere.

Northvolt certainly faced an uphill battle when it came to production costs, having relied on a footprint in northern Europe that is not known for low energy costs or quick industrial expansion, while also responding to severe shifts in the EV industry itself.

Another shift on the horizon is the expected arrival of solid-state battery tech that could once again upend the battery industry as demand for raw materials and technology shifts.

While no specific reason was publicly cited by the company, the cuts follow a pattern of job losses amid clean energy uncertainty.
Advocates warn this will only be the beginning, particularly if Republicans in Congress charge forward with their plans to repeal incentives for developing more clean energy.
“Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power.","All seven Republicans in Michigan’s congressional delegation backed a bill that would gut energy investments and put thousands of new manufacturing jobs at risk.

MICHIGAN—Every Republican representing Michigan in the US Congress voted last week for legislation to slash federal clean energy funding—a move that’s threatening to upend billions of dollars in manufacturing projects and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs across the state.

Now, elected officials, school leaders, and more than 100 Michigan business owners—including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford—are urging Congress to reverse course on President Donald Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful” budget bill before it’s too late for Michigan’s economy.

“It needs to be kept in place, the production tax credit,” Bill Ford, the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, said during a panel at the Mackinac Policy Conference this week. “Don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment. … That’s unfair.”

Here’s the Deal:

Sweeping legislation passed last week by House Republicans through the reconciliation process would deliver large tax breaks to the wealthy while slashing funds for essential programs like Medicaid and food assistance. And to help pay for it all, the bill would also repeal an array of federal clean energy tax credits established through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Those credits have helped turn Michigan into a national leader in clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicle production—adding more than 25,000 new jobs and nearly $40 billion in private investment statewide since the legislation was signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.

That includes funding to support Ford’s $3 billion, 1.8 million-square-foot BlueOval Battery Park project in Marshall, where Ford is actively hiring up to 1,700 workers to help make EV batteries.

But instead of protecting the tools that led to that economic growth, Michigan’s Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives effectively voted to dismantle them altogether, blocking any additional federal investments to support the project in Marshall, as well as dozens of additional clean energy projects that have been announced across the state.

And as the legislation advances to the US Senate, more than 100 small business owners, school leaders, and elected officials—including Ford—are sounding alarm bells and urging Republican lawmakers not to slam the brakes on Michigan’s economic momentum.

“The economic impact of this investment cannot be overstated,” Marshall-area community leaders wrote in a joint letter to Michigan’s Congressional delegation. “These jobs will strengthen our communities and provide quality employment opportunities for local residents.”

Ford also warned that repealing federal tax credits that have been driving business investments and creating jobs across the state would “put in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan.”

“Politicians can agree or disagree on whether those kinds of things are desirable, and that’s fine, but don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment,” Ford said this week.

A Unified Front—Against Michigan Workers

All seven of Michigan’s Republican members of Congress voted in favor of the bill, including:

US Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), whose district alone has reportedly seen more than 4,100 new clean energy jobs and $3.5 billion in energy-related investments.

US Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who is running for governor and recently signed a letter warning that repealing federal energy tax credits would hurt American manufacturing—but then voted to do exactly that on the House floor last week.

Clean energy advocates say their votes directly threaten dozens of Michigan-based projects, including battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, solar panel factories, and other energy infrastructure. The legislation would also reportedly put over $1 billion at risk for General Motors and Stellantis projects, which would help revitalize manufacturing facilities in Michigan.

In Barrett’s district, advocacy groups like Protect Our Jobs are already airing ads titled “Turned Your Back” across the Lansing media market. The campaign accuses Barrett of selling out voters living in his own district in order to fund new tax cuts for billionaires.

“Barrett turned his back on his constituents by voting against clean energy production and good paying jobs in his district,” said Kevin Self, senior advisor for Protect Our Jobs. “So we’re bringing the message directly to his constituents: Rep. Barrett turned his back on you.”

Busting Michigan’s Clean Energy Boom

Michigan has led the country in clean energy development since the Inflation Reduction Act became law and is now home to 74 announced projects that are set to generate about $40 billion in private investment and support over 25,000 newly announced clean energy jobs.

But since Trump was elected, the tide has been turning.

Workforce reductions have already hit four major clean energy facilities across the state this year, costing Michiganders nearly 600 jobs over the last four months, Climate Power reports.

And recent estimates show that thousands more are on the chopping block.

“Thousands of these jobs and billions in funding are at risk due to tariffs and pushes to repeal historic clean energy investments,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement this month.

Among the Michigan facilities already dealing with layoffs and closures this year:

General Motors, Factory Zero (Hamtramck): This month, GM laid off about 200 workers at its EV battery production facility, citing “market dynamics.” The cuts target the battery pack area and the company has no plans to rehire for the positions.

ZF North America (Marysville): A $157.7 million federal investment for EV component production, which supported more than 500 jobs, was canceled after Trump took office, halting plans to modernize the facility and expand its workforce, according to the report.

Samsung SDI (Auburn Hills): The company laid off 179 workers at its automotive battery headquarters in January. While no specific reason was publicly cited by the company, the cuts follow a pattern of job losses amid clean energy uncertainty.

Akasol (Warren and Hazel Park): Two Michigan battery plants are being permanently closed this spring and all 188 workers are being laid off as production shifts out of state.

Advocates warn this will only be the beginning, particularly if Republicans in Congress charge forward with their plans to repeal incentives for developing more clean energy.

“Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “On top of this crisis of uncertainty, repeal would devastate American manufacturing—halting construction, sending jobs overseas, hiking energy costs, and forfeiting the future to China and our other competitors.”

Recent polling shows 70% of Americans oppose repealing clean energy investments, with 65% of Michiganders saying it would harm the economy if the US ceded leadership on EVs to China.

Transcript of Ranking Member Kaptur exchange with Secretary Wright:

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

So one of the things I have to ask about is my own district. I don't understand why there was a project that was to be awarded to a glass company. And for some reason, it was pulled or it's sitting somewhere over there, and it has caused all kinds of problems for the company. You're a businessman. You would understand this if I can find the right sheet here.

There's so many sheets of paper. It's called Libbey glass and they have two furnaces. I come from an industrial part of America and life there has been hell for a long time because we forgot what the defense industrial base of this country really is. And we've been trying to catch up, but it's been hard.

And oh, here it is. OK. So the department had $6 billion in DOE investments that were leveraged with $14 billion of private sector investment. And one of those companies, Libbey Glass, which gave me permission to even use their -- I'm even afraid to use their name in public. They're a great company. They're a legacy company in our community.

I'll start to cry. They're generous and they work hard. And they are to replace four regenerative furnaces with two larger hybrid electric furnaces to reduce the carbon intensity of its Toledo Ohio facility by up to 50 percent. And the department is considering canceling more than 60 percent of their industrial demonstration projects, which would be devastating to our community.

And this is a company that never left the city. They didn't go out into the suburbs, OK, and break more ground. They're a responsible company. And for this award review and cancellation process, how is DOE or any part of your administration assessing which DOE projects will be canceled or continued? What criteria are you using?

And even if DOE chooses not to cancel any of these awards, these actions are creating mass confusion. Unemployment is going up in our area, by the way, and companies have canceled almost $8 billion in energy manufacturing projects so far just this year, five times more than was canceled last year. So given your private sector background, what can you do to help me understand what is happening to this particular company in the review process? Where are they?

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

Representative Kaptur, I appreciate your passion for industrial America, keeping the industries we have, bringing new industries home. We are so aligned on that. It's one of the things I'm excited about this administration. We've outsourced so many of those jobs overseas. I was lucky. I grew up in suburban America and got a great education.

I've had a dreamy life. I could have been born somewhere else. I could have had a very different life. I share your passion.

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

Thank you.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

I share your passion. So I think I mentioned briefly, I walk into a department that I am very passionate about energy and all that. I want to support as many activities and projects as we can, to save American industry and grow American industry. So fully aligned on that. I think I gave the numbers before, but I walked into a thing where $100 billion had been shoveled out the door in 76 days.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

I'm responsible for that money now, either in money out the door or committed to money to go out the door. I can't look at American taxpayers, including taxpayers in your district and say, yes, we invested $2 billion and we built a bridge to nowhere. We built something and now it's just closed because it had no marketplace, it had nowhere to go. So let me give you a quick little summary. So the answer is we haven't canceled any projects because we've been slow and careful and deliberative. We've developed a process. And in the next few months, we will run hundreds of projects, including those through our thing.

And if it's viable and it's going to create jobs and it's going to do these great things, we're going to support that project. And the simple little criterion we're looking at is legal, um, that technology, is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that's being built?

Is there a financial model that that co-funding is coming in together with the DOE funding, so the project can be complete? And does it add to national or economic security? It sounds like that one, if all the other things work certainly would. And it is aligned with this agenda?

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

Mr. Secretary, thank you for that, putting that on the record, but that was already approved. You are reviewing something that was -- all the appropriated money was already there. Those decisions had been made. So that is a very -- this is a very strange process because that -- those dollars weren't to be spent, um, already as we work toward the '26 budget.

Local officials said around 90% of Blatten was buried.

""What happened to Birch Glacier is what we would expect from rising temperatures in the Alps and elsewhere,"" he explained.","Thawing permafrost exacerbated by human-caused global heating is the likely culprit behind a massive glacier collapse that buried nearly the entire Swiss town of Blatten, one scientist said Thursday while warning of the likelihood of similar disasters in the future.

The alpine hamlet of 300 inhabitants—who were evacuated earlier amid warning signs of disaster—was almost completely wiped out on Wednesday after the Birch Glacier, located in the Lötschental Valley in northern Switzerland, collapsed. The glacial avalanche, laden with boulders and other debris, cascaded down the mountainside and into the village, obliterating everything in its path. Local officials said around 90% of Blatten was buried.

""We've lost our village,"" Blatten Mayor Matthias Bellwald told reporters. ""The village is under rubble. We will rebuild.""

While there are no verified casualties from the disaster, one 64-year-old man has been reported missing.

Mathieu Morlighem, a glaciologist at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, toldABC News that permafrost thaw under and along the sidewalls surrounding the glacier likely caused the collapse.

""What happened to Birch Glacier is what we would expect from rising temperatures in the Alps and elsewhere,"" he explained. ""I think we can expect more events like this in the future.""

As ABC News reported:

Glaciers in Switzerland have lost almost 40% of their volume since 2000, and the loss is accelerating, according to the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow, and Landscape Research. Record-high summer temperatures in 2022 and 2023 caused a 10% glacial ice loss in the country.

Experts warn that Switzerland's glaciers could disappear completely by 2100 due to the climate emergency.

As Common Dreamsreported in March, the crisis is planetary and is predicted to adversely affect nearly 2 billion people who depend upon glaciers for agricultural irrigation and drinking water.

""Most of the world's glaciers, including those in mountains, are melting at an accelerated rate worldwide,"" a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization report published earlier this year warned. ""Combined with accelerating permafrost thaw, declining snow cover, and more erratic snowfall patterns... this will have significant and irreversible impacts on local, regional, and global hydrology, including water availability.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60341959&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-05-30 18:08:49.512541

The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges.
With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel.
Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.
Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade.","Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project’s environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That’s far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area’s geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda,” she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They’ve had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission’s permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state’s contested case process.

The canceled awards were mainly for carbon capture and sequestration and other decarbonization projects, according to DOE. Affected companies include PPL Corp., Ørsted and Exxon Mobil Corp.

The Calpine projects are for CCS projects at its 550-MW gas-fired Sutter power plant in Yuba City, California, and its 810-MW Baytown power plant in Baytown, Texas.

“After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, the DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE said.

Sixteen of the 24 terminated awards were signed between President Donald Trump’s election in November and Jan. 20, according to DOE.

The NEF analysis estimates that Farage’s policies would cost more than 60,000 jobs in the growing wind and solar sectors by the end of the decade.
The analysis adds that 60,000 could be a “significant understatement”, given there are 273,000 people employed in these sectors, plus 678,000 in related supply chains.","Reform UK’s policies to “scrap net zero” would cost more than 60,000 jobs and wipe £92 billion off the UK economy, according to a new study.

Nigel Farage’s party — which took control of 10 councils in the recent local elections — this week claimed that the government could save £45 billion every year by ditching climate policies.

However, analysis by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) published today suggests that Reform’s policies would cost jobs and investment, and could raise household energy bills.

Reform, which is currently raising money from oil and gas executives, has vowed to ditch the government’s target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, scrap subsidies for renewable energy, and impose a windfall tax on wind and solar companies. Farage’s party would also expand new North Sea oil and gas extraction, claiming it would cut energy bills.

The NEF analysis estimates that Farage’s policies would cost more than 60,000 jobs in the growing wind and solar sectors by the end of the decade.

The analysis adds that 60,000 could be a “significant understatement”, given there are 273,000 people employed in these sectors, plus 678,000 in related supply chains.

This dwarfs the small number of new jobs that would likely be created by Reform’s plans to approve new North Sea oil and gas licences, said NEF. While the UK’s oil and gas reserves are dwindling, the country’s green economy grew by 10 percent in 2024.

The report concludes that making the UK renewables industry “unviable” would cost the economy around £92 billion – almost 3 percent of the UK’s GDP.

“Reform UK’s attack on net zero is reckless, economically illiterate and dangerous for Britain’s future,” said Chaitanya Kumar, head of economic and environmental policy at NEF.

“These measures will prevent billions of pounds being invested into the UK economy, drive up bills and will cost tens of thousands of jobs, including in some of the most deprived parts of the country.”

The analysis notes that Reform’s plan to expand oil and gas extraction would leave the UK vulnerable to a “gas price spike”, such as happened after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which could add at least £230 to household energy bills by 2030 compared to current government targets.

Kumar added: “The reality is net zero and investing in renewables is the greatest economic opportunity in this century. It will strengthen our economy, help cut bills for people across the country and help tackle the cost of living crisis.”

This comes as the party’s two recently elected mayors, Luke Campbell in Hull and East Yorkshire and Andrea Jenkyns in Greater Lincolnshire, have already drifted away from Reform’s anti-renewable policies and backed green investment in their areas.

As DeSmog previously revealed, Reform UK received £2.3 million from climate deniers, polluters and fossil fuel interests between the 2019 and 2024 general elections — equivalent to 92 percent of its funding during the period.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/farage-parliament.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 13:19:16.143560

Roeska stated that Ford has been “prudent” by “delaying and canceling EV growth” as it continues to work on its Model e unit.
Ford‘s EV unit reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million.
Despite a slight growth of 3% year to date, the stock has lost nearly 16% over the past twelve months.

In a new research note, the analyst said China’s EV market is “pushing ahead with scale and innovation” bifurcating the global EV industry and causing “distinct implications for OEMs, suppliers, energy players, and investors.”

“What follows is a capital intensive, politically volatile, and operationally complex expansion into the mainstream,” Roeska wrote.

Last week, Donald Trump’s bill proposing to cut EV tax credits was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, moving to the Senate.

On Thursday, U.S. EV maker Tesla urged the chamber for a “sensible wind down” on clean energy tax cuts, as they could “threaten America’s energy independence.”

Bernstein considered the Jeep maker Stellantis to be the “best positioned in the EV-slowdown” due to its “new multi technology platform,” as the brand produces various types of powertrains.

Roeska also noted that the group benefits from the “exposure to a faster growing EV market in Europe,” which places Stellantis better “than Detroit peers.”

According to the analyst, General Motors has been “cautious” by “reducing planned investments in battery manufacturing.”

Despite “slower EV volume growth and delayed EV profitability, GM is also avoiding knee-jerk reactions and taking a longer-term view,” he said.

Roeska stated that Ford has been “prudent” by “delaying and canceling EV growth” as it continues to work on its Model e unit.

The U.S. company reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings.

Ford‘s EV unit reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million. In the new note, Roeska said that “the company’s reporting structure makes it very visible that it will continue to lose billions on its EV business unit Model e.”

This, combined with the lack of “significant volume growth,” could result in Ford being “unable to turn a profit in upcoming years.”

Last week, Daniel Roeska had raised Ford’s price target to $8.30 over a “lower tariff impact in 2025” than previously expected. However, the new target still implied a downside of 20%.

Roeska had maintained the Underperform rating on the stock as it expects a “weaker” second half of the year due to “production cuts and tariff headwinds.”

Citing uncertainty over the tariff scenario, the automaker suspended its financial forecast as it reported its quarterly results, stating that it expected a $1.5 billion hit from Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading star-gazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.”

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin.

Cuts $3.7 Billion for New Technologies to Lower Emissions - The New York Times,"Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/climate/energy-dept-climate-tech-awards-cut.html,"The Energy Department announced on Friday that it was terminating $3.7 billion in Biden-era awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that might one day help tackle global warming.
Congress had approved tens of billions of dollars for trials of novel energy technologies as part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.
The Biden administration had worked to award most of those funds before President Trump came into office, including $6 billion for technologies to cut industrial emissions.
This month, the Energy Department announced that it would scrutinize a separate batch of 179 awards worth $15 billion, including funding to upgrade electric grids and promote domestic battery manufacturing.
This week, the Energy Department canceled a partial loan guarantee worth $2.92 billion to Sunnova Energy, a residential solar panel installer that was experimenting with a novel way to link home solar and battery systems.","The Energy Department announced on Friday that it was terminating $3.7 billion in Biden-era awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that might one day help tackle global warming.

Some of the 24 canceled awards would have gone to industrial companies that were aiming to reduce emissions from cement, iron, glass and chemicals production. Others had been awarded to fossil fuel and cement companies attempting to trap and bury carbon dioxide from their smokestacks before the gas escapes into the atmosphere and heats the planet.

Two of the terminated awards, worth $540 million in all, would have gone to Calpine, one of the nation’s largest producers of electricity, which was trying to capture and store the carbon from two large natural gas power plants in Yuba City, Calif., and Baytown, Texas.

Also on the chopping block was a $331 million award to the oil giant Exxon Mobil, which had been planning to replace natural gas with lower-emissions hydrogen at a chemical facility in Baytown, Texas.

In announcing the cuts, the Energy Department said in a statement that the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

“Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. He said that the previous administration had “failed to conduct a thorough financial review” of the spending and suggested the process had been rushed, noting that 16 of the awards had been made between Election Day and President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

Congress had approved tens of billions of dollars for trials of novel energy technologies as part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The goal was to demonstrate promising techniques for cutting emissions so that companies would later invest in them.

The Biden administration had worked to award most of those funds before President Trump came into office, including $6 billion for technologies to cut industrial emissions. Many of the awards were legally binding, but they often had conditions attached to them and most of the money has yet to be spent.

At a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Wright said he wanted to review all Biden-era awards closely. The Trump administration has sought to drastically scale back the federal role in addressing climate change.

This month, the Energy Department announced that it would scrutinize a separate batch of 179 awards worth $15 billion, including funding to upgrade electric grids and promote domestic battery manufacturing. The agency said it would demand extensive information from awardees and warned that failure to respond adequately could be used as grounds for termination. The agency has not announced the results of that review.

Some experts said that canceling efforts to test novel technologies would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage.

“Many of these projects involve new ways to make cement or chemicals, and they’re things that China and other countries are already investing in,” said Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization focused on technological innovation in energy. “If we’re not making these investments, we’ll be losing the race to develop and demonstrate and deploy these advanced technologies.”

Mr. Chapman pointed out that China has recently announced more than 100 energy demonstration projects, which included new ways to make clean-burning hydrogen fuels or low-carbon steel.

Other awards canceled by the Energy Department on Friday include: $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, a cement manufacturer that aims to capture and bury the carbon dioxide emissions from a large cement plant in Louisiana; $189 million to Brimstone, a company trying to reduce emissions from cement by changing the ingredients, using carbon-free silicate rock instead of limestone; and $170.9 million to Kraft Heinz, a food manufacturer, which had planned to install electric boilers and heat pumps to generate the large amounts of heat needed for things like drying macaroni without directly burning fossil fuels.

The Energy Department still oversees tens of billions of dollars that it has obligated for a wide variety of other energy projects, including hubs to produce hydrogen fuels and to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The agency’s Loan Programs Office has also awarded more than $100 billion in loans and loan guarantees to mining companies, electric vehicle makers and other companies trying to bring nascent technologies to market.

But some of that funding has also started to be pulled back. This week, the Energy Department canceled a partial loan guarantee worth $2.92 billion to Sunnova Energy, a residential solar panel installer that was experimenting with a novel way to link home solar and battery systems.

In that case, the loan cancellation came after Sunnova said that it didn’t intend to use the funds “for the foreseeable future.” Sunnova’s business had been running into trouble even before the Trump administration came into office, partly because of high interest rates and reduced state incentives.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30cli-energy-tkbv/30cli-energy-tkbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:46.871602

“We’ll be digging in the Army Corps’ DEIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement); however, our position on the tunnel and Line 5 has not changed,"" the Sierra Club's Anne Woiwode said in a statement.
The suits in state and federal court have so far been unsuccessful in closing the line or eliminating the agreement.","Lansing — Federal regulators on Friday released a long-awaited draft study that found that most of the environmental effects resulting from constructing a tunnel to house Line 5 beneath the Straits of Mackinac would be temporary and tied almost exclusively to construction activities.

The tunnel, the study found, would have a ""beneficial cumulative effect"" on reducing the risk of a crude oil leak from the pipeline.

The draft Environmental Impact Statement released Friday, a report the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working on for nearly five years, analyzed Enbridge's proposed 3.6-mile tunnel to house a new segment of Line 5 and two other alternatives to the tunnel: Doing nothing and keeping the current dual pipeline in place on the lakebed, or covering exposed portions of the current dual pipeline with gravel and rock.

""The applicant’s preferred alternative,"" the report said, referring to the tunnel construction proposal, ""would have a beneficial cumulative effect on reduced risks of a petroleum leak in the Straits and, when combined with one of the decommissioning sub-alternatives, improvements to water-based recreation.""

The release of the draft statement launches a 30-day public comment period, the preparation of a final statement, and the expected release of a final record of decision this fall. The decision timeline has been somewhat shortened by President Donald Trump's declaration of a national energy emergency in January, which speeds up the deliberation process. The approval is one of the last Enbridge needs before it moves forward with tunnel construction; it is also awaiting one other state permit.

Enbridge, in a statement Friday, said the report is an important ""milestone"" in the project and incorporates extensive survey work generated from more than 40,000 data points.

""Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,"" said Ryan Duffy, a spokesman for Enbridge. ""The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the DEIS (draft Environmental Impact Statement) to further refine the project.""

The Sierra Club Michigan Chapter in a statement Friday argued Gov. Gretchen Whitmer should ""step in"" and block the tunnel from moving forward. Whitmer's legal efforts to close the pipeline have so far been unsuccessful, but her Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy currently is assessing a permit request from Enbridge for the tunnel.

“We’ll be digging in the Army Corps’ DEIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement); however, our position on the tunnel and Line 5 has not changed,"" the Sierra Club's Anne Woiwode said in a statement. ""Line 5 remains an existential threat. Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits.""

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prepared the environmental impact statement released Thursday as part of its consideration of a permit for the project under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act.

The corps also is analyzing, separate from the EIS, the tunnel construction’s impact to historic properties and its potential impingement on the treaty rights of federally recognized tribes. The corps’ analysis of those factors will be included in the final record of decision expected this fall.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said in a statement Friday.

Overall, the study found construction of the tunnel would have temporary effects on noise, vibration, aesthetics, recreation, some wildlife and geology in the area while the structure is being built. The lasting negative effects, the statement found, were confined to a loss of several acres of vegetation and wetlands due to the buildings that would be constructed at the entrance and exit of the tunnel in Mackinaw City and St. Ignace.

The tunnel, the corps found, would serve as a secondary containment in the event of a leak from the pipeline and would reduce the maintenance and surveillance activities currently required to ensure the safety of the dual pipelines that have been located on the lakebed since the 1960s.

The analysis found there would be a steady or slightly increased need through 2050 for the products transported through the pipeline. Analysts noted that determination was made before the current president lifted restrictions and encouraged domestic energy exploration.

""The USACE determined the current needs for transport of the pipeline products are supported by their existing use, and the need for the pipeline products in the foreseeable future is supported,"" the report said.

Failure of the tunnel via a collapse or explosion — concerns raised by some opponents to the plan — ""is not reasonably foreseeable,"" the report said.

The corps' analysis of an alternative to the tunnel — that of covering exposed portions of the current pipeline with gravel or rock — found doing so would result in a permanent change in the lakebed. However, the study found, overall, the cumulative detrimental effects would be less under the gravel protective cover alternative than under the proposed tunnel.

But both the gravel protective cover or the continued current placement of the dual pipelines on the lakebed fail to provide a secondary containment method in the event of a leak, the report found.

The report also noted there are drawbacks to keeping the dual pipeline in place as is.

""Maintenance activities would continue to occur,"" the report indicated. ""As the pipelines age, it is anticipated that additional deterioration could result in some release of metals into the surface water. In addition, the potential for vessel anchor strikes would remain.""

While the likelihood of anchor strikes under both the gravel cover and current arrangement are unlikely, the tunnel plan eliminates the probability completely, the report found.

Under the report issued by the corps, the risk of an anchor strike with the current placement of the dual pipelines is about once every 1,300 years; the potential failure rate of a gravel cover due to an anchor strike is once every 128,000 years.

The pipeline was struck by an anchor in 2018 and, in 2020, was ordered shut down temporarily after an inspection uncovered damage to one of the pipeline’s anchor supports that appeared to indicate something had been dragged across it.

The 2018 anchor strike advanced discussions between then Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and Enbridge, both of whom had been debating extra security measures for the pipeline after a 2010 spill from Enbridge's Line 6B in Marshall raised concerns about a similar catastrophe involving Line 5's Straits of Mackinac segment at the intersection of Lakes Michigan and Huron.

Shortly before leaving office in 2018, Snyder entered an agreement with Enbridge in which the company agreed to spend more than $500 million building a tunnel and replacement segment of Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac.

The agreement and Line 5's continued operation in the Straits were challenged by Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel and Whitmer in several different lawsuits. The suits in state and federal court have so far been unsuccessful in closing the line or eliminating the agreement. However, cases still are pending in Ingham County Circuit Court and U.S. District Court regarding the pipeline's continued operation.

Additionally, a regulatory approval for the tunnel project awarded by the Michigan Public Service Commission has been appealed and is currently awaiting a decision from the Michigan Supreme Court. And the U.S. continues treaty negotiations with Canada after the neighbor to the north in 2021 invoked a never-before-used treaty to protect the pipeline from Michigan's efforts to close it.

Home Electrification Incentives in North Dakota

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.

The administration plans to use the LPO to support investments that will restart closed nuclear power plants, increase the output of operating plants, build new advanced reactors, and strengthening the US nuclear fuel supply chain.
Bipartisan support for nuclear power is strong in the Senate.","One of the best-known sayings of the celebrated free-market economist Thomas Sowell is: “There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.” The Trump administration has faced a sharp demonstration of that point over its policy on nuclear power.

President Donald Trump last week signed four executive orders aimed at delivering the often-promised “nuclear renaissance” for the US. Trump administration officials, including Chris Wright, the energy secretary, have made it clear that they see increased nuclear generation as essential for US national security.

But the budget legislation currently being negotiated in Congress includes several measures that would hold back the growth of nuclear power in the US.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives last week and is now before the Senate, meets many of the administration’s overall goals for tax and spending policy.

But among its wide-ranging impacts on the energy industry are changes that the US nuclear industry has flagged as concerns. In particular, the bill confirms the phase-out for the 45U tax credit for existing nuclear plants that was created in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, bringing it forward by a year to the end of 2031.

It also accelerates the phase-out of the 48E technology-neutral investment tax credit for zero-carbon energy. Under the bill passed by the House, nuclear projects would have to start construction by the end of 2028 to be eligible. That is not much time to get a new project underway.

The House also proposed cutting funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO). The office has supported nuclear investments, including the two AP1000 reactors built at the Vogtle plant in Georgia and the restart of the Palisades reactor in Michigan.

The administration plans to use the LPO to support investments that will restart closed nuclear power plants, increase the output of operating plants, build new advanced reactors, and strengthening the US nuclear fuel supply chain.

But the House budget bill withdraws any funding for the LPO that has not already been committed. It has been reported that nearly 60% of the office’s staff could be leaving.

The final version of the bill that emerges after negotiations with the Senate could be significantly different from the version passed in the House. The nuclear industry is still arguing its case. Maria Korsnick, CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said earlier this month: “We’re facing some headwinds, and the actions we take today will define what the future looks like.”

In contrast to the bad news coming out of Congress, President Trump’s executive orders have been welcomed by the industry. The most significant of those orders will expedite approvals by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), setting a new deadline of 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type.

Scott Strazik, chief executive of GE Vernova, said in an interview that the first new NRC approvals for small modular reactors (SMRs) could be granted by 2027, creating a “credible shot” of having the first plants on stream by late 2030 or 2031.

There is also financial support available for SMRs. The Department of Energy recently reissued a US$900 million funding program for Generation III+ light-water SMRs, originally set up under the Biden administration.

But there are questions over how far expedited approvals and support for demonstration projects will drive investment in new nuclear, if the fundamental economics are unfavorable.

Bipartisan support for nuclear power is strong in the Senate. But it remains to be seen how far senators will push for pro-nuclear provisions in the bill, given all the other pressures they face to deliver tax cuts and limit the increase in the budget deficit.

The Wood Mackenzie view

Despite the threats posed by the proposed legislation, Wood Mackenzie analysts still think the US nuclear industry has a bright long-term future. Both commercial and policy imperatives point to the need to develop and deploy new reactors.

The Trump administration’s energy policies reflect a view that the US should not try to compete with China in electric vehicles, solar power and energy storage. Chinese manufacturers generally dominate these global supply chains so it will be difficult to displace them.

But in new nuclear technologies such as SMRs, the competition is less intense, says Prakash Sharma, Wood Mackenzie’s head of scenarios and technologies. There is still room for the US to innovate and scale up to out-compete China.

For US companies planning to increase their electricity consumption, particularly data centre operators aiming to bring new capacity online, new nuclear plants could be important.

The time taken to develop and build new reactors means they will be able to make only a marginal contribution for the next 10 years at least. But in the long term, new nuclear plants could make a significant contribution to increasing US electricity supply.

Nuclear power is particularly attractive for tech companies that need dispatchable power to keep their data centres running 24/7 and have set ambitious goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Only a handful of technologies are available for providing zero-carbon baseload electricity, and nuclear is one of them.

All that said, the version of the budget bill passed by the House does pose some threats to the US nuclear industry in the short to medium term. But Wood Mackenzie’s Sharma says there is still time for the Senate to fight for more pro-nuclear measures in the legislation.

“The final version of the bill might look more acceptable and amenable to the industry and investors,” he says.

Supreme Court ruling tightens scope of US environmental reviews

The US Supreme Court has issued an important ruling on environmental approvals that could help remove obstacles to infrastructure development. The court ruled in favour of a group attempting to build an 88-mile railway line from the Uinta Basin oil province in Utah to connect to the national rail network. Environmental groups and a county in Colorado had been fighting against the project. They had success in lower courts with the argument that the environmental impact statement for the railway required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) had not considered all the relevant issues, even though it was 3,600 pages long.

The Supreme Court rejected that view in a unanimous decision. Lower courts had accepted the argument that the environmental impact statement should take into account activities connected to the project. So if the new rail line would allow increased oil production in the Uinta Basin, and increased consumption of oil products refined from that crude, the resulting increase in emissions should be factored into the decision on whether to approve the project.

The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that only the direct impacts from the rail line should be considered. The decision could have wide-ranging implications for other energy projects that need approvals under NEPA, such as LNG plants, potentially blocking off some tactics that have been used by environmental groups to obstruct development.

In brief

Most of President Trump’s new tariffs were blocked by the US Court of International Trade, but then reinstated, at least for the time being, by an appeals court. The trade court had ruled that the president had overstepped his legal authority in announcing such sweeping tariff measures. The appeals court put a stay on the lower court’s decision until it had had a chance to consider the arguments from both sides.

The US Constitution specifies that it is Congress that has the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises”, although legislation has given the president a range of opportunities to impose tariffs in emergencies and other specified circumstances. The dispute is now likely to head to the Supreme Court for a ruling.

Ministers from the OPEC+ countries agreed at a meeting on Wednesday to leave their production levels unchanged. The eight members of the group that have been unwinding their voluntary output cuts, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, will be discussing their plans for further increases over the weekend. Brent crude was trading at about US$64 a barrel on Friday morning, close to its level at the start of the week.

BYD, the Chinese car company that is the world’s largest manufacturer of EVs, has announced steep price cuts ranging up to 34% for some models. The move has raised fears about the profitability of China’s vehicle industry.

Quote of the week

“By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don't just survive ongoing trade wars but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world's leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change.”

King Charles III, giving a speech in Canada’s Senate for the opening of the new session of Parliament, set out the agenda for the government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney. The king’s words, delivered in French, highlighted the priorities set out by the new government.

Tim Hodgson, the energy and natural resources minister, used similar language recently, saying the government was committed “to making Canada an energy superpower”.

Chart of the week

This comes from our new Horizons report, Trading cases: Tariff scenarios for taxing times. The volatility of US tariff policy means it is impossible to derive forecasts for energy and commodities over the next few years and stick to them with any confidence. In response, we have developed three scenarios, essentially reflecting low, moderate and high tariffs, and then modelled the outlooks for our key sectors in those scenarios.

The chart here shows projections for oil demand in those three cases. In “trade truce” and “trade tensions”, or low and moderate tariff scenarios, the world economy continues to grow and, hence, so does oil demand. In the “trade war”, we have a global recession, resulting in significantly lower oil demand and prices.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/cities/_micro_city_nyc_gettyimages-1005120852.jpeg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-05-30 14:27:50.678025

Montana constitutional climate case, are suing the Trump administration over its climate and energy policies.

The plaintiffs argue in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that by dismantling climate protections and working to “unleash” American energy, the executive branch is violating the separation of powers clause in the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also argue that the president’s executive orders are threatening their rights to life and liberty.

The lead plaintiff in the litigation is Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old Livingston resident who also was a plaintiff in a constitutional lawsuit that challenged Montana’s permissive approach to approving fossil fuel projects. Lighthiser is joined by Rikki Held and eight other plaintiffs from the Montana litigation, as well as a handful of young Americans from Hawaii, Oregon, Florida and California.

During a seven-day bench trial in 2023, the Held lawsuit focused an international spotlight on Montana and its unique constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment,” which the district court — and later the Montana Supreme Court — interpreted to include a “stable climate system.”

The federal lawsuit Lighthiser and her co-plaintiffs filed on May 29 challenges three executive orders that Trump issued during the first three months of his second term in the White House. The plaintiffs argue that the orders have suppressed climate science and slowed the transition to renewable energy sources in favor of fossil fuels, “thereby worsening the air pollution and climate conditions that immediately harm and endanger Plaintiffs’ lives and personal security.”

The plaintiffs are asking the court to invalidate the executive orders and direct Trump and the 11 federal agencies listed as defendants not to implement or enforce them.

“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the 126-page filing reads.

In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser described Trump’s fossil fuel directives as a “death sentence for my generation.”

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to,” said Lighthiser, who plans to pursue environmental studies in college. “My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. [President Trump is] waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.”

In an email to Montana Free Press on Thursday, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended Trump’s energy agenda.

“The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill for the lefts’ radical climate agenda,” Rogers wrote.

In addition to enumerating the climate harms plaintiffs have reported, including wildfire-related and heat-induced visits to the emergency room, diminished career opportunities, property damage spurred by extreme weather events and a loss of cultural and recreational traditions, the complaint outlines tensions between Trump’s executive orders and the missions of congressionally authorized agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One of the executive orders named in the lawsuit directs federal agencies to identify and rescind actions that place an “undue burden” on the “identification, development or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral and nuclear energy resources.” Another directs executive branch agencies to use emergency powers to facilitate energy companies’ access to federally-owned energy resources and the infrastructure required to transport and process them. The third focuses on the development and prioritization of coal-fired electricity.

In the Held v.

After two months of crude oil prices hovering around $60 a barrel, companies are shutting down drilling rigs and laying off workers as they pare spending. It now appears very likely that U.S. oil production will not grow much this year, if at all.

There are two main reasons for low oil prices. President Trump’s trade war is likely to slow the global economy, hurting demand for fuel. And OPEC Plus, an oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia, is increasing production of oil as demand is softening.

On Saturday, eight members of the cartel are widely expected to announce plans to bring even more oil to market this summer, which could send prices lower still.

American oil companies are not waiting to find out.

While Exxon Mobil and Chevron are maintaining their spending plans, smaller companies are pulling back. Those focused on drilling for oil now plan to spend around 3.5 percent less this year than previously planned, according to a BloombergNEF analysis of a dozen publicly traded companies. All things equal, more drilling tends to drive oil prices down and less drilling generally props them up.

“We can’t run our program on hope,” Tom Jorden, chief executive of the oil and gas producer Coterra Energy, told analysts during an earnings call this month. “So we are battening down the hatches, expecting this to last for a while.”

The Houston-based company said it would drill less in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. oil field, and more in the Northeast, which is rich in natural gas. Prices for that fuel, used in power plants and for heating, have been much more resilient.

Lower oil production is the opposite of what Mr. Trump promised during his campaign, which frequently repeated the chant “Drill, baby, drill.”

The pullback means that production in U.S. shale basins, which generate most of the country’s oil, is likely to start declining later this year, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based organization of industrialized countries including the United States.

The contraction could be swift if oil falls under $60 a barrel and remains there. For every dollar below that threshold, the I.E.A. estimates, five drilling rigs could be pulled out of U.S. fields. When companies drop rigs, workers often lose their jobs, hurting the economy of states like Texas.

Diamondback Energy, one of the Permian’s largest oil producers, said the heart of the U.S. oil industry had already hit peak production. The country pumps more than 13 million barrels of oil each day, making it the world’s biggest oil producer.

“It is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter,” Travis Stice, who until recently was chief executive of Diamondback, wrote in a May 5 letter to shareholders. “To use a driving analogy, we are taking our foot off the accelerator as we approach a red light.”

Diamondback cut its annual spending forecast by 10 percent.

Oil prices have been volatile in recent months, falling as the United States and its trading partners have raised tariffs, then recovering just as quickly on any hint of a pause in trade hostilities.

Late Wednesday, for example, prices climbed toward $63 a barrel after the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked Mr. Trump from putting in place some of his highest tariffs. They retreated on Thursday, the same day a federal court temporarily paused that ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now.

What has remained consistent is that oil fetches much less than it did before Mr. Trump took office, when it was close to $80 a barrel. Then, most U.S. producers were earning healthy profits.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30biz-oil-slowdown-bzgc/30biz-oil-slowdown-bzgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:57.501419

The move brought a proposed 88-mile railroad line that would transport crude oil from oilfields in northern Utah to refineries on the Gulf Coast one step closer to production. Environmental groups and a neighboring Colorado county had told the justices that the federal agency that approved the project had failed to consider its broader environmental costs.

In ruling for the railroad, the justices sketched out a relatively narrow role for courts reviewing future decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act, the landmark environmental law at the center of the case. Emphasizing that the “goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it,” Justice Brett Kavanagh explained that courts should give “substantial deference” to the agency’s determination as to what should be included in the environmental impact statement prepared for a project. “In deciding cases involving the American economy,” Kavanaugh concluded, “courts should strive, where possible, for clarity and predictability.”

The court’s three Democratic appointees agreed more narrowly with the result that their colleagues reached, even if they did not agree with the reasoning that they used to arrive at that conclusion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the majority “unnecessarily ground[ed] its analysis largely in matters of policy,” but the board, based on the statute itself, did not have the power to reject the application to build the railroad based on any negative effects that might flow from products carried on the railway.

The dispute before the court began after the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a proposal by a group of Utah counties to build a railroad line that would connect with the broader interstate freight rail network to “facilitate the transportation of crude oil” from the state’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to refineries in states like Louisiana and Texas. The proposed train would quadruple production at Utah’s largest oil and gas fields. In August 2021, the board released an environmental impact statement that was more than 3,600 pages long and addressed the environmental consequences of the project. In approving the project in December of that year, the board explained that the project’s “substantial transportation and economic benefits” outweighed those environmental effects.

Several environmental groups and Eagle County, Colorado, challenged the board’s decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court threw out the board’s order approving the project. It reasoned that the board should have taken a “hard look” at all of the railroad’s environmental effects. This would include, the court of appeals said, both the “upstream” effects – effects from oil drilling in the basin – and the “downstream” effects – effects from oil refining along the Gulf Coast.

On Thursday the Supreme Court reversed. Kavanaugh explained that although NEPA requires agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement “identifying significant environmental effects of the projects, as well as feasible alternatives,” the law at its core “is purely procedural.” In reaching its decision about whether a project should go forward, he wrote, “an ‘agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs.’”

When courts are reviewing these determinations, Kavanaugh continued, “the central principle” is “deference.” Kavanaugh acknowledged that since last year’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, courts generally do not provide deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statute, instead taking a fresh look at the law. “But when” – as in this situation – “an agency exercises discretion granted by a statute,” Kavanaugh wrote, courts instead look at whether the agency action “was reasonable and reasonably explained.” In NEPA cases, he stated, “an agency’s only obligation is to prepare an adequate report.”

Kavanaugh spelled out the limits on the role of the courts even more clearly, stressing that “it is critical to disaggregate the agency’s role from the court’s role. So long as the EIS addresses environmental effects from the project at issue,” he wrote, “courts should defer to agencies’ decisions about where to draw the line—including (i) how far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand and (ii) whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.”

Kavanaugh also criticized courts that have in the past, in his view, not provided the kind of deference that NEPA requires. In doing so, he suggested, those courts “have slowed down or blocked many projects and, in turn, caused litigation-averse agencies to take ever more time and to prepare even longer EISs for future projects.” And as a result, he concluded, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects.”

The effects of that transformation, Kavanaugh explained, are significant. “Fewer projects make it to the finish line” or even “the starting line,” he stated – and the ones that do make it are more expensive. “A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak,” he said, “that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process.”

The D.C. Circuit’s ruling was also wrong, Kavanaugh added, because the board was not required to address the environmental effects of “projects that are separate in time or place from the” railroad itself. Indeed, Kavanaugh observed, “those separate projects fall outside the Board’s authority and would be initiated, if at all, by” other parties.

In an 11-page opinion, Sotomayor faulted the majority for relying on policy considerations but explained that the board did not have the power to reject railroad applications based on the ways that other entities would use the products carried on the proposed railroad. As a result, she reasoned, the board could not have rejected the Utah counties’ request based on a desire to “prevent the harmful effects of oil drilling and refining.” Therefore, she concluded, she agreed with her colleagues’ decision to reverse the D.C. Circuit’s ruling “requiring the Board to consider in further detail harms caused by the oil industry.”",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/supreme-court2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 13:19:37.056566

Eight of the top 10 states for utility-scale clean energy deployment in the first quarter of 2025 voted Republican in last year’s Presidential election, the American Clean Power Association said on Thursday.

Texas was the runaway leader with more than 1,700 MW of wind, solar and energy storage deployments and a 20% year-over-year increase in total clean energy capacity. Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Wyoming rounded out the top five, ACP said.

The 7.4 GW of new clean power capacity in the U.S. was the second-strongest Q1 on record. Energy storage was the fastest-growing segment, with nationwide battery storage capacity increasing 65% year over year.

Dive Insight:

Total utility-scale clean energy deployments in the first quarter of this year came in 9% shy of the record-setting first quarter of 2024, when developers commissioned 8,089 MW of wind, solar and storage capacity, ACP said.

ACP’s data reflects the increasingly broad geography of utility-scale solar and storage deployments. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity, adding 435 MW, while Illinois, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Ohio all deployed far more solar than California. Total U.S. clean energy capacity sits at about 320.9 GW — of which, 80.7 GW is in Texas, ACP said.

The clean power development pipeline expanded as well, growing 12% year over year to reach about 184.4 GW and an estimated $328 billion in completed value. But that marks a slowdown from a year ago, when fully permitted clean power capacity under construction or in advanced development rose 26% from Q1 2023.

Developers have canceled more than $14 billion in clean energy projects so far this year amid uncertainty over the future of federal tax credits for clean energy investment, production and manufacturing, according to the consulting group E2.

ACP’s latest report hinted at the scale of the potential risk to state and local economies if the House GOP’s proposed rapid wind-down of energy tax credits remains in the final budget reconciliation bill that now sits before the Senate.

Domestic manufacturing and energy production investments now generate $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and landowner payments in rural communities and have created nearly 650,000 jobs, ACP said.

“We have the technology, investment capital and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline,” Grumet said, describing those projects as shovel-ready. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Utilities and independent power producers across the South, Midwest and West have proposed dozens of gigawatts of new gas-fired generation projects since 2023, including an up to 4.5-GW project in western Pennsylvania that could begin operations next year and eventually become the United States’ largest gas power plant.

However, Senior U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello in her ruling late Thursday prohibited Denver Water from filling Gross Reservoir and ordered federal environmental permits to be rewritten by the Army Corps of Engineers.

“There is no evidence that there would be additional environmental injury resulting from completion of the dam construction. In fact, the opposite is true,” Arguello wrote. “There is a risk of environmental injury and loss of human life if dam construction is halted for another two years while Denver Water redesigns the structure of the dam and gets that re-design approved by” the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FERC is involved because of the hydroelectric plant at the base of the dam.

The judge initially shut the project down April 3, saying that the Army Corps and Denver Water had violated the federal Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act when the Gross Reservoir expansion permits were issued in 2017.

Denver Water, which serves 1.5 million people, was not immediately available for comment, but has said previously that it will appeal issues raised in the April 3 injunction.

Save The Colorado, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said Friday morning that it will defend the portion of the Thursday ruling that prevents additional diversion of Colorado River water.

How the case progressed

In her April 3 ruling, Arguello said Denver Water had acted recklessly in proceeding with construction in 2022, knowing that important legal questions were being challenged by Save The Colorado, the Sierra Club and others.

The massive construction project to raise the dam 131 feet and triple the capacity of Gross Reservoir has sparked fierce opposition in Boulder County and prompted several legal challenges from Save The Colorado, a group that advocates on behalf of rivers. Though its early lawsuits failed, the group in 2022 won an appeal that put the legal battle back in play. Despite months of settlement talks, no agreement was reached.

Denver Water first moved to raise Gross Dam more than 20 years ago when the water provider began designing the expansion and seeking the necessary federal and state permits. Denver Water has said raising the dam and increasing capacity of the reservoir is necessary to ensure it has enough water throughout its delivery system and to help with future water supplies as climate change continues to reduce stream flows.

After years of engineering, environmental studies and federal and state analyses, Denver received a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and construction began in 2022.

Arguello’s April 3 ruling said, in part, that the Army Corps should have considered whether ongoing climate change and drought would leave the Colorado River and Western Slope waterways too depleted to safely allow transfer of Denver Water’s rights into a larger Gross Reservoir for Front Range water users.

At the same time, she ordered a permanent injunction prohibiting enlargement of the reservoir, including tree removal and water diversion, and impacts to wildlife.

Almost immediately, Denver Water filed for temporary relief from the order, saying, in part, that it would be unsafe to stop work as the incomplete concrete walls towered above Gross Reservoir.

Arguello granted that request, too, allowing Denver to continue work on the dam considered necessary for safety.

U.S. automakers want to build them here, but they can’t do it without federal subsidies and China’s help. Now, as those subsidies are under the woodchipper, Ford’s joint battery plant with Chinese battery maker CATL in Michigan is on shaky ground. That could spell trouble for its affordable EV plans.

30%: Ford Distressed Over End Of EV Production Credits

Ford’s EV plans are going off the rails. The automaker planned to build a $3.5 billion LFP battery plant in collaboration with Chinese battery juggernaut CATL by licensing its technology, promising some 2,500 jobs and a boost to Michigan’s economy.

After EV sales started growing at a slower pace than once estimated, Ford scaled back the size of the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, reducing the investment to around $2.2 billion and the number of jobs to 1,700. It was initially promised around $1 billion in incentives for the plant—that amount was later slashed by half.

The plant also drew political ire for CATL’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party and suspected human rights violations. Now the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful bill” could gut the manufacturing credits, which would have helped Ford build the plant—that’s if the Senate doesn’t make crucial changes to it before it gets passed.

The executive chairman of the automaker, Bill Ford, is ringing the alarm bells over the potential demise of the manufacturing credits. Here’s more from Automotive News:

“We have built the business case on Marshall around that,” the chairman told reporters after a panel discussion at the Mackinac Policy Conference. “My point is politicians can agree or disagree whether those kind of things are desirable, and that’s fine. But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness, and that’s unfair.”

Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.

“I don’t know the likelihood, but I do know that if it goes away, it puts in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan,” he said.

It’s hard to overstate how crucial low-cost batteries are to bring the price of EVs down to gas-car levels. High purchase price remains the biggest barrier to mainstream EV adoption and LFP batteries offer a real shot at bringing that down.

In China, 81.5% of installed EV battery capacity now comes from LFP cells. Most new EVs are equipped with LFP batteries in the country. And Chinese battery makers like CATL and BYD have rapidly advanced the tech—what was once seen as a low-energy-density option now consistently delivers longer-range EVs.

For Ford, GM, Hyundai, Tesla and others, government subsidies have been key to scaling up local EV and battery production. The manufacturing credits haven’t just created jobs and boosted local economies, they’ve also helped automakers absorb the upfront costs of electrification and could still soften the blow from tariffs.

If Ford’s Michigan battery plant collapses, it would be a major setback for its plans to deliver affordable EVs that are made in America.

60%: Hyundai May Increase Prices Starting Next Week

If you’ve been EV-shopping lately, you may have noticed that Hyundai and Kia have extensive hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric options to choose from.

Even though most of their new EVs are now manufactured in the U.S. at Hyundai Motor Group’s plants in Georgia, they still use plenty of parts sourced from overseas. With the Trump administration’s blanket 25% tariffs on imported vehicle parts and foreign-made cars, experts have said that car prices could soon increase.

Now Automotive News has reported that Hyundai is considering a 1% price hike across the board starting next week on newly built models. Vehicles currently in the inventory would remain unaffected, but new models could cost hundreds of dollars more.

Here’s more from that report:

“This period marks our regular annual pricing review, guided by market dynamics and consumer demand, independent of tariffs,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to adapt to shifts in supply and demand, and regulations, with a flexible pricing strategy and targeted incentive programs.”

The company had previously said prices would hold through June 2, but automakers are now recalibrating—looking for ways to absorb tariff costs without taking a major hit to profits. Some of that cost burden, it seems, will be paid for by American consumers.

90%: Tesla Breaks Silence On The End Of Energy Tax Credits

Tesla has issued its strongest warning yet against the current administration’s war against clean energy programs. The automaker said ending federal tax credits could deal a major blow to America’s energy independence.

The alarm comes as CEO Elon Musk wraps up his brief but disruptive run as the government’s cost-cutter-in-chief—a move that’s bruised Tesla’s brand and sent its sales and profits into freefall. One outlet phrased it perfectly: the CEO and the company are now on an “image rehab tour.”

Here’s what Tesla Energy posted on X on Thursday:

Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid - we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.

It’s an important point. Tesla isn’t just a car company, it’s also a booming energy business. It sells solar panels and stationary energy storage systems. Sections 25D and 48E under the Inflation Reduction Act have been central in making those things more affordable to regular homeowners—25D is the residential clean energy credit that subsidizes installations such as solar panels, whereas 48E supports businesses who build that equipment, such as Tesla.

Everything that promises cleaner air is under the guillotine with this administration, not just EVs.

100%: Should The Senate Preserve Manufacturing Credits?

Amending the bill to preserve the manufacturing credits would alleviate the financial burden of EV and battery manufacturing, not just for Ford, but also for dozens of other brands and companies upstream and downstream in the EV supply chain.

More importantly, it would allow American car companies to finally build LFP battery cells in the U.S. and truly bring the costs down for EVs—even as they explore alternative chemistries to do the same.

Should lawmakers keep the policies steady after companies have already made billion-dollar bets on clean energy? And can the U.S. realistically make affordable EVs without battery tech like LFP and help from Chinese companies?

Which industries will be most affected if the House bill becomes law?","The Republican-led House of Representatives has narrowly passed a giant tax and spending bill that would end Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for clean power years early.

The proposed changes threaten to unravel a variety of incentives that would result in higher prices for everything from electricity to solar panels.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where it will most likely undergo changes. Here’s what to know about what’s in the passed version of the House bill and how it might change in the Senate.

What are potential economic consequences?

A full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act would cut GDP $1.1 trillion, cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and spike consumer energy bills, according to think tank Energy Innovation Policy & Technology.

While a number of clean energy projects would get canceled if the House bill passes in its current form in the Senate, others would re-negotiate contracts with utilities or corporate offtakers, according to BloombergNEF’s Americas Head Ethan Zindler. “The result would inevitably be higher priced power in substantial parts of the US,” he said.

How does the House bill affect clean energy incentives?

Solar

The cost of installing solar panels on your home would soar under the House bill as it eliminates a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of the year. The legislation also rescinds a 30% tax credit for home battery storage systems. Even if you rent your solar array, the cost is likely to spike as the bill immediately scraps a tax credit for companies like Sunrun that lease systems to homeowners.

“If I could see a knockout punch for solar, it would be if all of a sudden systems got 30% more expensive and payback times got 30% longer,” said Reuben Ly, sales manager for A1 Sun, a family-owned solar installer in Berkeley, California.

Some Republicans in the Senate have objected to the wholesale gutting of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. But if the date of the 17-year-old residential solar tax credit’s demise is uncertain, it seems apparent that its days are numbered, given Republicans’ vow to scuttle the incentive.

So if you’re thinking about going solar, now’s the time to find out if it’s possible to have panels installed by year end.

Heat pumps

If your fossil fuel furnace or water heater is on its last legs, it would be prudent to replace it now with a high-efficiency electric heat pump as the House bill revokes a $2,000 federal tax credit for the devices at the end of the 2025.

Electric vehicles

The $7,500 federal tax rebate for most electric vehicle purchases would end this year instead of 2032. Yet EVs may well maintain much of their momentum. Axing the federal tax credits would cut the EV share of new car sales in 2030 from around 48% to 42%, according to new research from Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.

A large swath of EV buyers don’t qualify for federal rebates anyway, either because they make too much money or buy cars that are priced above payout thresholds. And three out of four buyers who received federal EV rebates would have bought an electric car anyway, according to a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Still, there could be nasty little surprises in the near future. The House bill adds a $250 charge to registration fees for electric vehicles and a similar $100 charge to registration of hybrid vehicles, both designed to make up for lost gasoline tax revenue for non-fossil-fuel vehicles.

Which industries will be most affected if the House bill becomes law?

Solar already is suffering. Shares of Sunrun Inc., America’s biggest rooftop-solar company, fell as much as 42% on May 22 — the most ever in intraday trading. Equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. slid as much as 27%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, slid as much as 10.7%, the most since October 2023.

The House bill represents a “nightmare scenario for US clean energy advocates and defenders of the Biden-era IRA,” BloombergNEF analysts Ethan Zindler and Derrick Flakoll wrote in a May 22 note. The provisions that bar US projects from using components, subcomponents or even materials from China would make it nearly impossible for US solar and battery manufacturers to qualify for the tax incentives, they wrote.

How will investors react?

If passed by the Senate, the repeal of IRA credits would inject “significant regulatory and political risk” and undermine the US’s position as “the world’s leading destination for clean tech capital post-IRA,” said Alex Bibani, a senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in London.

“For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago,” he said. “Project economics, supply chain commitments and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU unless clarity is quickly restored.”

How likely is the Senate to amend the cuts to clean energy incentives?

The Senate is expected to tweak the House’s move to gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, but how much remains an open question.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the Senate plans to write its own version of the bill and several GOP senators said they thought the phase-out of incentives, including for clean electricity and nuclear power, was too aggressive.

But given the House’s slim margin — Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a handful of votes to pass the legislation — major changes in the Senate may not fly.

“The Senate will have a mind of its own,” Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican who chaired the Conservative Climate Caucus when he served in the House of Representatives, said in an interview. But he added: “We’re also very well aware that it’s a tenuous situation in the House and that will be respected.”

What effect have the clean energy credits had?

Inflation Reduction Act credits have helped drive hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment into manufacturing and wide-spread deployment of solar panels, electric vehicles and other emission reduction technology since the law’s passage in August 2022. Much of that has gone to Republican-leaning areas where labor and land costs tend to be cheaper.

Tax credits from the climate law have led to $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all US private investment in the first quarter of 2025, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation. An additional $522 billion of outstanding investment has been announced across 2,217 facilities, which is expected to create more than 680,000 operational and construction jobs, the research firm said in an analysis.

“Many of these announced investments are at risk of being cancelled if the Reconciliation text is passed as drafted,” the firm said.

What impact could this have on US emissions?

US greenhouse gas emissions peaked in the mid-2000s and have been more or less declining since then — though not nearly as fast as scientists worldwide say is needed to prevent catastrophic levels of global warming. US emissions stayed relatively flat in 2024. One big reason why President Joe Biden and Congress passed the IRA was to help drive down the nation’s emissions more quickly in the next decade.

That progress could be lost by unraveling those polices, leading to more climate pollution. Repealing the energy tax credits, for example, could increase emissions anywhere between at least 500 million metric tons to more than a gigaton in 2035, according to one estimate by the research firm Rhodium Group.

Ending the clean vehicle tax credit would result in a sharp decrease in EV sales in the U.S., Fix said.

""Once that tax credit goes away, I'm expecting [electric vehicles] to be about 2% of sales,"" Fix said, noting that EVs currently account for around 8% of total car sales in the U.S. ""There will still be electric vehicle sales, Tesla will still survive and [Elon Musk] will do well. And other brands will make what consumers want.""

Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer in the U.S., has focused more on selling carbon credits to other automakers than it has on consumer tax incentives. The company, which has moved the bulk of its production to Texas, has also become ""more efficient and effective"" in its manufacturing, according to Fix.

""What Tesla has done, and they don't really care about the $7,500 tax credit, is they were selling carbon credits to all the other car manufacturers,"" Fix said. ""That's where they've made their profits.""

Still, keeping the Campbell plant in service may not be that easy, said Greg VanWoerkom, a Michigan state representative who represents the area.","The Trump administration’s emergency order last week to extend the life of an aging coal plant that faced permanent closure this weekend is baffling experts and enraging clean-power advocates.

The decree thrust the J.H. Campbell power plant on the shores of Lake Michigan to the fore of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the country’s struggling coal industry. Conservative lawmakers who called for the extension hailed the move as a way to help a Midwest electric system facing occasional stress — and to counteract a years-long shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. The regional grid’s operator, however, said it did not ask for the action to be taken, raising questions on why it was deemed to be so urgent by the Trump administration.

“This is a fake emergency,” says Tyson Slocum, an energy expert with watchdog group Public Citizen, which plans to challenge the order. “This is a political abuse of statutory emergency powers.”

The Campbell plant in West Olive, which first went into service in 1962, has three units with a total of 1.45 gigawatts of capacity. Majority owner Consumers Energy announced plans in 2021 to shut the facility and stop burning coal by this year. The official shutdown date is May 31, but US Energy Secretary Chris Wright upended that plan with an announcement late on May 23, a Friday leading into a three-day holiday weekend.

“I hereby determine that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes,” he wrote in an emergency order.

The decree came as the central US power grid operated by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator heads into summer at an elevated risk of energy shortages during heat waves and other extreme events. Demand for power has been climbing, and stress in the MISO system has building, especially in the Midwest, as utilities shut down coal and natural gas plants to rely more heavily on intermittent wind and solar.

The Energy Department determined that the immediate fix for the crisis was demanding that the Campbell plant stay in service for an additional 90 days, using authority granted by the Federal Power Act.

“Under President Trump, the DOE and Secretary Wright are ensuring Americans have access to all forms of reliable energy, including coal,” a Department of Energy spokesperson said. “For years, American grid operators have warned decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems, including MISO, which has raised alarm bells. This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The CEO of MISO, John Bear, has previously outlined the challenges decarbonization poses to electric reliability. Yet the grid operator and some Michigan authorities seem to dispute whether the extension was essential right now. “MISO did not request the delay but we will coordinate with Consumers Energy to support compliance with the federal order as we prepare to maintain grid reliability throughout the summer season,” said Brandon Morris, a spokesman for the grid operator. “As you know, our recent planning resource auction demonstrated sufficient capacity for the upcoming year.”

No emergency exists, either in Michigan or MISO, according to Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. “We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Scripps said in a statement. “The unnecessary recent order from the US Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.”

The decree was also unusual because the Department of Energy was acting without a formal application for an emergency order, according to Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard Law School’s electricity law initiative.

Typically, “DOE is not looking for emergencies, it is acting on a request,” Peskoe said.

Reviving coal has become a personal issue for Trump, and the order creates the possibility of others being kept alive by decree, said Slocum. “He wants to be the president who saved coal fired power plants,” he said. “This is a political operation.”

The Trump administration made the move to keep the Michigan plant alive as it and Republicans in the House of Representatives have pursued policies that risk weakening renewables — power sources that can often be added to grids faster than new gas-fired plants. Clean power also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change, which is fueling heat waves that place increasing energy demands on grids.

The Energy Department order was preceded by an April 30 letter from seven Michigan state Republican lawmakers warning Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that “we have tremendous concern that Michigan’s energy reliability and security will be irreparably weakened” as power providers shutter coal and gas plants.

The energy landscape has shifted in the years since Consumers Energy said it would close Campbell, said Roger Victory, the Republican state senator who represents the plant’s west Michigan location, and one of the lawmakers who signed the letter. Demand for electricity is climbing, driven by factories and data centers that need reliable power around the clock. That makes facilities like Campbell more important, and shutting them is taxing the grid, raising the risk of power shortages.

“Think of the cost of blackouts,” Victory said in an interview.

In fact, that just happened in Louisiana, where tens of thousands of customers in New Orleans and other parts of the state lost power over Memorial Day weekend. MISO ordered local utility Entergy Corp. to curtail power as high temperatures led to higher-than-expected demand.

Still, keeping the Campbell plant in service may not be that easy, said Greg VanWoerkom, a Michigan state representative who represents the area. Consumers Energy has been planning the shutdown for years. The company has deferred some maintenance, it’s made plans to shift workers to other facilities and shipments of coal have ceased. And while he would be happy to see all those power-plant jobs remain in his district, it may not be practical.

VanWoerkom, a Republican, was aware of the letter his colleagues sent to Washington, but declined to sign it.

“I would love for it to stay open, but it’s a little late in the process,” he said in an interview. “It would require a lot of capital investment to get it to the shape it needs to be.”

Adapting to the new reality won't be easy.

Big picture view:

Climate change is driving an increase in heat waves and cold spells on the Great Lakes, with almost every recorded increase in both extremes coming after the mid-1990s.

All five Great Lakes have seen their temperature intensities surge over 100%, with the tipping point coming after an El-Niño in 1997-1998, according to a new study.

While fish populations can respond to changes in water temperatures by migrating to other parts of the lake, rapid shifts in cold or heat can happen too quickly for them to react, leading to large-scale die-offs.

Nuclear power plants become harder to keep cool while ice coverage falls. The temperature extremes also generates conditions for larger algal blooms, while lake stratification - a process that mixes nutrients and increase oxygen levels throughout the water body - also falters.

""We're entering a new era,"" said Dr. Hazem Abdelhady, the lead author of the study, which was published in Communications Earth and Environment.

Dig deeper:

The authors looked at 80 years of extreme temperatures on the Great Lakes for the study. The vast majority of the hottest and coldest days were recorded after 1998,

Not every lake has seen the same extremes, however, with Lake Superior experiencing the largest increase in cold and warm days. The dynamic is tied to a loss of historic ice coverage.

With less ice, the lake is absorbing more radiation from the sun, which causes less ice to form. The feedback loop has been intensifying over the years.

""Lake Superior is stuck in a dangerous cycle,"" said Abdelhady.

The shift toward more heatwaves was most notable from December to May, which is when ice cover historically played a larger role. However, during that same time period, there was also an increase in extreme cold days.

Why you should care:

The Great Lakes regulate the region's weather and some have suggested it could become a haven for people fleeing other extreme conditions around the country.

But the region is not immune from its own dangerous storms. It recorded some of its rainiest years ever recently, while Michigan is in the midst of its most active tornado season ever.

And Abdelhady's study suggests the Great Lakes is experiencing its own temperature extremes as well.

The highest number of heatwaves was in 2012-2013, which followed the most severe round of cold spells on record in 2014-2015. The whiplash makes predicting weather patterns harder. It also means preparing for significant weather events like heavy rainstorms and snowfall.

The modern energy system relies on a variety of energy resources and technologies. Energy resources include fuels to generate electricity and heat, as well as nonferrous minerals, such as those needed in energy technology components. As diversification is key to strengthening the security of an energy system, introducing renewable energy sources to reduce heavy dependence on fossil fuels—the energy transition—has contributed not only to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also to strengthening energy security. Ensuring access to these fuels and technology components for electricity generation and transmission requires robust and transparent supply chains. As such, securing robust and transparent supply chains has become synonymous with safeguarding the energy transition.

The United States has been investing in strengthening the nation’s energy industrial base. The successive U.S. administrations in recent decades have assessed the nation’s energy-related supply chain resilience and undertaken measures to address its vulnerabilities. For example, the first Trump administration (2017–2020) issued the first federal strategy to strengthen critical minerals supply chains, several executive orders related to the supply chains for electric power components, as well as actions such as the issuance of federal support for minerals projects. The supply-chain agenda continues to enjoy bipartisan support from the executive and legislative branches. During the Biden administration (2021–2024), critical minerals were a key focus of a wide-ranging vulnerability assessment that the White House undertook on the state of supply-chain resilience and resultant federal actions. The second Trump administration (2025–present) has already signaled continued strong attention on the availability and access to resources, such as critical minerals and uranium.

Supply-chain security has emerged as a top-tier priority for Washington due to a confluence of global developments. Earlier last decade, Beijing’s increasing assertiveness began raising a policy question on the efficacy of relying on China for materials as important for energy and advanced technologies as critical minerals. The debilitating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy, starting around spring 2021, illuminated the fragility of global supply chains for commodities that are essential for public health and energy resources alike. Adding to these major drivers was Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine in spring 2022. The economic plight—let alone the security challenges—faced by Ukraine and the European economies underscores how energy supplies can be weaponized in a major global conflict, and how energy security and economic security are closely intertwined. The notion of securing the energy supply chains has also gained a geoeconomic driver more recently. The growing demand for energy that is anticipated from running the AI and underlying data centers, together with the electrification trend for decarbonization, requires the expansion and modernization of the electric power grid as well as power plants.

Major Areas of Supply-Chain Challenges and the Existing Bilateral Cooperation

Several energy resources and technologies for a clean energy economy exhibit major vulnerabilities in their supply chains. The following are the top areas where inaction would have energy security, economic, and geopolitical consequences.

Clean Technology Components and Requisite Minerals

The demand for clean energy technologies, such as solar power and electric vehicle (EV) batteries, has been on a growth trajectory. A policy concern is that their global supply chains have a significant level of Chinese presence, where the country accounts for at least 60 percent of their global production capacity. What’s more, the expansion of clean energy technologies is expanding mineral demands, as an energy system powered by clean energy technologies requires more minerals than its fossil fuel-based counterparts. The types of mineral resources used in clean energy technologies vary by technology, but China generally dominates their global supply chains, especially in mineral refining. Notably, the United States is highly dependent on China for many of its official list of critical minerals.

While it is not mineral-rich, Japan is a vital partner in strengthening the critical minerals supply chains, as an off-taker, a source of project finance, downstream manufacturing, as well as a materials research and development (R&D) hub. Japan, along with the European Union, has been a founding partner under the U.S.-EU-Japan Trilateral Conference on Critical Materials. Established in response to soaring prices of some rare earths and critical minerals in 2011, the Trilateral Conference (known as the Conference on Critical Materials and Minerals since June 2021) has advanced information exchange on policies and R&D as well as helped the successful pursuit of a World Trade Organization dispute settlement case in 2014, against China’s export duties and quotas.

Also, Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement in March 2023 that the two countries would not levy export duties on critical minerals they trade. This sectoral trade agreement reflects not only Japan’s interest in accessing tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act but also the U.S. interest in engaging Japan in its friendshoring efforts. For example, Japan and South Korea are currently the only other key sources of EV battery cathode active materials outside China; China accounts for 90 percent of the global capacity, while Japan and South Korea jointly account for the remaining 10 percent.

The two countries cooperate through multilateral fora, too. Under the U.S.-initiated Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), Japan is partnering with a major Congolese entity over minerals development that is tied to a G7-initiated Lobito Corridor railway modernization project in Africa. Under the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, making supply chains diversified, resilient, and transparent was a key objective of its supply chain pillar. Critical minerals and mining, and energy industries (e.g., electric grid technologies, nuclear energy, advanced batteries, and solar and wind components) were two of the sectors that Washington identified for potential cooperation in its August 2024 announcement.

Nuclear-Power Technology and Fuels

Nuclear energy is gaining renewed attention for its non-carbon-emitting attribute. At the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai in 2023, about 30 countries pledged to work towards tripling the installed nuclear power generation capacity by 2050. In the United States, the renewed interest in nuclear—both large and small—comes especially due to the strong forecast for electricity demand from the computational energy requirement of AI. However, a stagnant domestic orderbook over several decades has led to supply-chain challenges, such as the limited capacity in large-scale forging and fabrication. In contrast, Russia leads the world in exporting nuclear power reactors and enriched fuel, while China is set to rival the United States in the installed capacity of domestic, civilian nuclear reactors by 2030.

The resilience of domestic supply chains for nuclear components affects not only the ability to meet the domestic needs for reactor construction, but also the opportunity to capture overseas markets. While most of the global nuclear power plants are in advanced economies today, interest is rising among many in the Global South that currently do not have a nuclear power generation program. What is at stake is not merely economics, as nuclear commerce helps maintain or expand ties between technology supplier and importer countries.

Nuclear energy has long been a key area of bilateral cooperation, involving national R&D institutions. Under the first Trump administration, the two governments reinforced the commitment. The ongoing interests and investments in U.S. reactor projects—both public and private—from Japanese utility and engineering companies demonstrate Japan’s importance as a close partner. Multilaterally, Japan has been contributing actively to the U.S. efforts to promote small modular nuclear globally, such as that under the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, while also joining forces with the United States in striving to diversify the global supply chains for nuclear fuels under the Sapporo 5, a multilateral initiative launched at Japan’s G7 energy ministerial in 2023.

Electric Grid System

The electric power system is another area of supply chain challenges. Growing electricity demand from both decarbonization and AI and datacenter operational purposes points to a significant requirement for additional power supply. This means that the nation will need more grid components, such as transformers and equipment like switchgear, as well as transmission lines in the coming years. However, the U.S. ability to meet the requirement is severely constrained. The limited capacity for domestic production has rendered the replacement lead times for large power transformers to more than double between 2021 and 2024.

Moreover, our modern electricity system is increasingly reliant on information and communications technology (ICT). Therefore, the risk of cyberattacks has become one of the paramount concerns. Cyber risks to the electric power system can arise not only from direct attacks aimed at the critical infrastructure, but also through exploitation of vulnerabilities in the component supply chains, including insertion of counterfeits and insertion of malicious software.

Supply-chain resilience for these components and infrastructure has become a national security concern, not only for its high import dependence (80 percent in 2019) but also for its reliance on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Japan, with its significant expertise in material science, is a key supplier of critical materials, such as high-grade grain-oriented electrical steel, which is a key raw material for large power transformers. On the ICT supply-chain front, Washington and Tokyo have begun consulting closely, including through the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on Digital Economy.

A Way Forward

Advancing an objective as strategic as securing these energy supply chains is most effective when pursued in partnership with countries that have a shared assessment of the nature and urgency of the challenge, as well as the technological and industrial capacity to address them. Japan is head above the rest. Cooperation with Japan will significantly enhance U.S. efforts to secure these supply chains, given the strong synergies between the two countries.

Clean Energy Technology

While clean energy does not enjoy a high-level focus under the Trump administration, some of the technologies continue to merit strong government focus as they provide security as well as decarbonization benefits. While the effort to reduce the China dependence in the supply chains for established technologies may continue to merit, Washington and Tokyo should consider dedicating a sizable share of their joint efforts also towards clean energy technologies that are still in their early stage.

Hydrogen fuel cells and electrolyzers are one such category of technologies. Fuel cells can provide a reliable (and backup) power supply from hydrogen on-site, either for civilian and non-civilian applications. Also, electrolyzer technology is key to producing cleaner hydrogen by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. In particular, the global supply chains for proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies are still in the nascent stage. PEM technology may be more complex, yet more compatible with intermittent renewables than alkaline-based technologies, where China already leads in global manufacturing capacity.

Due to their nascency, policy support and industry actions are likely to effectuate PEM technology supply chains which have more diversity, robustness, and resilience that are lacking in many other clean tech supply chains today. The U.S.-Japan cooperation should consider a consultative platform to ensure that their innovation outcomes are successfully scaled up for manufacturing and mass production within the West. The two countries could also engage like-minded countries, such as the European Union, to jointly formulate measures to nurture the technology supply chains that are resilient against the potential inflow of components due to overcapacity problems in China.

Critical Minerals

The second Trump administration has signaled a significant commitment to expanding the domestic capacity in minerals production. This will likely encompass more expansive use of federal financing tools, including for engagement of resource-rich foreign countries. Multilaterally, Washington and Tokyo should continue to leverage existing platforms, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), to effectively infuse competitiveness, sustainability, and transparency in their global supply chains.

Such potential was already evident as the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order directed the secretary of state to “consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.” Moreover, Japan may consider serving as the MSP chair in the coming years, while the two countries can also guide the minerals security agenda for the IEA. Bilaterally, the United States may consider partnering with Japan to raise additional capital to support the development of mineral production capacity at home that, in turn, accords Japan access to U.S. mineral supplies in times of supply disruptions.

Nuclear-Power Technology and Fuels

Nuclear energy is among the domestic energy priorities for the Trump administration. With its continued expertise in large-scale forging and fabrication, Japan would be a natural ally for the United States, as the U.S. power sector strives to meet the requirement for component supplies for refurbishing or replacing large reactors. Meanwhile, U.S. developers of small modular reactors and advanced reactors may find engineering and construction partners in the Japanese nuclear industry, especially as the U.S. vendors eye emerging nuclear markets with limited local industrial capacity.

Moreover, Washington could work closely with Japan in instilling diversity and robustness in the global supply chains for nuclear fuels. Potential measures may include Japan’s investment in the new U.S. fuel production capacity, including for High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium fuel that is needed for advanced reactors in development. Such engagement would mean additional capital for the U.S. effort as well as an alternate supply source to enhance Japan’s nuclear fuel supply security. The two governments should also consult on how they may further leverage the Sapporo 5 framework.

Electric Grid System

Securing the grid system supply chains is an important task not only to meet the future volumetric requirement, but also to safeguard our modern electric network from exploitation of vulnerabilities in technology components. Washington should consider strategic partnerships with Tokyo and others with production capacities that are geopolitically aligned.

For example, the Japanese component supplies can help fill the U.S. supply gap, as U.S. utilities strive to meet the growing demand for these grid components. Another idea is for the Japanese manufacturers to invest in the United States to help augment the supply chain resilience.

As Chinese components are generally much cheaper than their competitors, Washington may consider providing support, such as the Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities. In fact, while the use of DPA for energy technology components as promulgated by the Biden administration was rescinded in March 2025, the DPA use for transformers appears to have been left intact. Washington and Tokyo should explore paths towards closer supply-chain engagement over critical electric grid components, such as transformers.

Lacey Mayor Peter Curatolo said the bill would eliminate township officials from the approval process.

LACEY -- A new bill under consideration by New Jersey lawmakers could cut municipal and county officials out of the process to approve new small-scale nuclear energy facilities.

The bill, S4423, would make the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities able to authorize construction of small modular nuclear reactors, without approval from municipal or county authorities, in towns that currently or at one time had nuclear plants.

The rule would only apply to two municipalities in New Jersey: Lacey and Lower Alloways Creek in Salem County. Lower Alloways Creek is home to the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants.

In Lacey, the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station stopped producing electricity in 2018. The facility is being decommissioned by a division of Holtec International, which is also working to develop a small modular reactor prototype.

The New Jersey bill, if approved, would permit small modular reactor operators to store nuclear waste on the property until a permanent national repository is approved. The bill would also direct the Board of Public Utilities to provide financial incentives for the development of these new variety of reactors.

""With rising utility prices and increasing demand for electricity as we pursue electrification, New Jersey needs to increase our production capacity without worsening climate change with new fossil fuel burning facilities,"" state Sen. Robert Smith, D-Middlesex, said in a news release. Smith is the bill's primary sponsor and chair of the state Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

""Properly regulated nuclear power is reliable, safe and most importantly does not emit greenhouse gases,"" he said.

Lacey Mayor Peter Curatolo said he opposed the portion of the bill that would cut township authorities out of the decision-making process.

""It's important for us to have home rule and to be the final determinant for land use as the local authority having jurisdiction,"" he said by phone.

Small modular reactors, or SMRs, are nuclear fission reactors that generate 300 megawatts or less of electricity, or about a third of the power of a traditional nuclear reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

As a result of their smaller scale, these reactors rely on passive systems that would not require human intervention or external power to shut down in case of an emergency, according to the agency. They could also be manufactured at a facility, then pieced together at another location at lower cost than the construction of traditional nuclear facilities, according to the energy agency.

""These increased safety margins, in some cases, eliminate or significantly lower the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity to the environment and the public in case of an accident,"" agency officials wrote on their website about small modular reactors.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling on the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to speed up the approval process for the nation's first SMRs, other small-scale reactor models and new kinds of nuclear facilities. The secretary is also charged with streamlining the environmental review process for nuclear energy projects.

""It is the policy of my Administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible,"" the president wrote in his order.

In 2023, 42% of the electricity produced in New Jersey came from nuclear sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas plants produced nearly half of the state's electricity, according to the agency.

Curatolo, the Lacey mayor, said he supports the creation of SMRs, but wants township officials to have a voice in the process.

""I do believe small modular reactors are the future and make the most sense for the economy,"" he said. ""They will produce energy for us. And I believe in the technology, and I believe it is the future, and that we could do it well here in Lacey Township.""

Gretchen Whitmer to take further action to stop the Line 5 pipeline tunnel.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found multiple ""direct, detrimental effects"" that would be caused to land, groundwater and surface water by the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline tunnel proposal.

Many of the environmental impacts would be alleviated after the tunnel's construction, the Army Corps found.

A 3.6-mile tunnel proposed for construction beneath the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom to house a new oil and gas pipeline would cause ""direct, detrimental effects"" such as loss of trees, wetlands and other habitat; underwater and surface water disturbances; potential loss of archeological features and potentially years of snarled traffic in the area, a draft environmental impact statement released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finds.

But most of the detrimental effects of the project proposed by Canadian oil transport giant Enbridge would occur only during the tunnel's construction, and would lessen or alleviate afterward, according to the Army Corps study released May 30.

The report arrives with controversy. The Army Corps announced in April it would expedite its review of the contentious pipeline tunnel project to comply with President Donald Trump's energy emergency executive order. Critics of the move contend a project of the scope and potential long-term magnitude of the pipeline tunnel, in the area where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron connect, should be careful and deliberative.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and cost more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom would be greatly more devastating.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom. Enbridge officials have said that placing the pipeline in a tunnel beneath the Straits lessens risks and potential impacts.

Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy called the draft environmental impact statement release by the Army Corps of Engineers ""a significant milestone in the development of the Great Lakes Tunnel ... a project that will modernize energy infrastructure, protect the Great Lakes, and ensure long-term energy reliability for Michigan and the broader region.""

Enbridge officials push back on the notion that evaluation of the project has been rushed or less than comprehensive.

The draft environmental impact study ""is the result of more than five years of rigorous and comprehensive permit review and stakeholder engagement,"" Duffy said.

'Direct, detrimental effects are probable' during construction

The Army Corps' environmental impact examined multiple scenarios: Enbridge's pipeline and tunnel plan; a do-nothing alternative; a proposal to keep the existing pipelines operating on the Straits lake bottom but put a protective cover of rocks and gravel over them; and three different decommissioning alternatives to stop operation of the more than 70-year-old twin pipelines on the Straits bottom, one option leaving the pipes in place, others removing portions of the pipelines.

The Corps study found Enbridge's tunnel plan would disturb and remove 19 acres of vegetation, including the clearing of more than 5 acres of forested land and nearly 5 acres of permanent wetlands loss.

Direct, detrimental impacts to groundwater would occur for the duration of shaft and portal construction, expected to last six and eight months, respectively, and while the tunnel boring machine was in operation, the Army Corps found. Groundwater aquifers would be drawn down by 2 feet in a 360-foot radius during shaft and portal construction, but testing indicates the aquifer ""would recover within a few days of (tunnel boring machine) operations in a given location,"" the study states.

Potential negative impacts to groundwater quality from drilling fluid releases, contaminants from onshore materials storage and the use of heavy equipment are also possible. ""The associated impacts would end following construction,"" the report states.

Surface water impacts include that ""approximately 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid (water and bentonite) would be released"" during installation of a water intake structure and pipe for the tunnel project, the Army Corps report states. ""Approximately 31.4 acres total ground disturbance would occur within proposed construction footprints, which could result in direct, detrimental impacts to surface waters adjacent to construction footprints due to erosion and sedimentation,"" the study additionally finds.

Noise and vibration during tunnel installation, along with blasting, could impact area recreation and both land and aquatic animals, but would cease after tunnel construction, the study finds.

A tunnel construction would bring 162 daily truck roundtrips to the south side of the Straits of Mackinac and another 120 daily truck roundtrips to the north side, which the Army Corp found ""would increase traffic safety risks and degrade level of service on public roadways — ""especially during the peak commuting hours and peak recreational seasons and holidays. Direct, detrimental effects are probable and would occur throughout the construction period (approximately 6 years) which would end following construction.""

Environmental groups call on Whitmer for help

Environmental groups are calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to take further action to stop the Line 5 pipeline tunnel.""The laws protecting the Great Lakes are not up for debate. For years, it’s been clear state and federal permits are being crafted with forgone conclusions that provide yet another handout to Big Oil,"" said Beth Wallace, Great Lakes climate and energy director for the environmental nonprofit National Wildlife Federation's Ann Arbor office.

""Governor Whitmer and Michigan officials have a duty to protect the Great Lakes, which are held in public trust for all. This is why the State of Michigan has to require a full review of risk to our bottomlands, under the Submerged Lands Act. This is not just about Line 5.

The bottomlands of the Straits belong to the people of Michigan, not to Enbridge, and it is the state’s duty to act on its residents' behalf, said Ashley Rudzinski, climate and environment program director at the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, a nonprofit organization based in Traverse City.

""That means requiring a full, independent review of the proposed drilling and blasting of the Great Lakes bottomlands — not rubber-stamping a project that serves corporate profits over public good,"" she said.

Utility-scale solar led the Q1 additions by far, with 4.46GW of new capacity added compared with 1.6GW of energy storage and 1.3GW of onshore wind capacity.

Perhaps more notable than the new additions, ACP said that the national renewable energy project pipeline grew 12% year-on-year in Q1 2025, reaching 184.4GW. The energy storage pipeline, in particular, grew by 57%. If everything in the pipeline is built, ACP said it will represent US$328 billion in project investment.

It noted that projects included in this figure are “typically” fully permitted projects, and that the growth of the pipeline does not indicate growth in the number of projects receiving permits. However, ACP’s announcement said: “These market-driven investments reflect growing demand for reliable, affordable domestic energy from utilities and major American companies.”

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale. With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet. “We have the technology, investment capital, and workforce required to build the US$300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline. The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Republican states

Of the ten states which installed the most capacity in Q1, eight voted Republican in the November presidential election, ACP said. Texas, Florida and Indiana, all of which are red states, led Q1 installations, with the former far outstripping any other state and growing by 20% to reach over 80GW of cumulative capacity.

ACP’s report said: “The industry’s growth is particularly strong in Republican-leaning states, where domestic manufacturing and energy production has created nearly 650,000 direct and indirect jobs and generates US$3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and payments to landowners in rural communities.”

Since coming to power, Donald Trump’s Republican administration has set about broadly attacking the federal incentives for clean energy production and manufacturing introduced by the previous government. Most recently, a bill which passed the US House of Representatives proposes to effectively end the 30% investment and production tax credits (ITC/PTC) for clean energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by imposing a 60-day deadline for any project to receive federal credits.

Many in the renewables industries – particularly solar PV, which has become the leading source of new US electricity capacity – have pointed to the positive benefits that Republican states have seen off the back of IRA tax credits. Much of the roughly 50GW of US solar module manufacturing capacity now operational is in broadly Republican states like Texas, Ohio and Georgia.

Nonetheless, clean energy has become politicised amid broad pushback against net-zero policies and a presidential promise to “drill, baby, drill”.

Despite the strong installation figures reported by ACP, another report published this week by research platform E2 found that US firms had delayed or cancelled US$14 billion worth of clean energy investments since January 2025, the month when Trump took office.

Crucially, the report said that significantly more investment had been delayed or cancelled than had gone ahead in the first four months of the year.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/qcells2.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:28:02.130035

The renewable energy industry currently faces a potential repeal of tax credits as part of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” which narrowly passed the House of Representatives and now heads to the Senate for approval.

If approved, the new budget would effectively eliminate tax credits for all renewable energy projects not placed in service by 2028.

Utility-scale solar projects often take years to progress from early development to construction and activation, and equipment providers are sounding the alarm to secure tax-credit eligible components before the budget is passed.

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project’s total capital expenditures were incurred before new legislative changes take effect.

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of business development for PV Hardware USA, a solar tracker provider.

Two critical project-level tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act will be repealed if the budget passes the Senate as currently written. This includes the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC).

The ITC is a project-level credit that covers 30% of the cost of an installed project. This credit is offered to projects of any size, from utility-scale power plants to homeowners and small businesses installing solar on their rooftops.

The PTC is a generation-side tax credit, crediting emissions-free electricity generators generally between 0.3 cents per kWh to 1.5 cents per kWh.

PV Hardware said it is ready to support solar tracker procurement before the legislative changes take effect. The company said it has over 5 GW of safe harbor product that can help developers meet the capital expenditure requirements to qualify for the tax credits.

“We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics,” said Bitar. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

The budget bill is expected to have devastating effects on the renewable energy industry if passed as-is. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the bill could jeopardize nearly 300 U.S.-based solar and storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 GWh of solar generation by 2030.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, SEIA.",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/05/pexels-kindel-media-9875449-2048x1536-1-1200x900.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:39.732142

These states would join the four other states that have obtained Class VI primacy thus far: North Dakota (2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2024), and West Virginia (2025).","As part of an ongoing Blog series, Arnold & Porter’s cross-practice Energy and Energy Transition team is highlighting key legal and regulatory developments for clients across economic sectors.

A recent Fifth Circuit decision has eased the path for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delegate authority to state agencies to issue and enforce Class VI injection well permits, a key permit needed for most carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects.

In Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, a group of NGOs had challenged the Biden administration’s 2024 decision to grant Louisiana Class VI permitting authority — referred to as “primacy” under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the case after concluding that the groups lacked either organizational or associational standing. First, the court determined that petitioners “cannot manufacture its own standing” by alleging that the primacy approval forced them to divert time and resources that would otherwise go towards the group’s other activities. The court also determined that petitioners lacked associational standing on behalf of its individual members, finding that they could not satisfy the imminence or traceability requirements of Article III.

Among other things, petitioners challenged the liability transfer mechanism in Louisiana’s CCS legislation. This mechanism requires CCS operators to pay into a trust fund throughout the course of injection operations, and in exchange the state assumes long-term responsibility and liability for the facility after closure if certain technical requirements are met and the trust is adequately funded. See L.R.S. § 30:1109. Petitioners alleged that its members would face future harm if an incident occurred after a state transfer because they could receive reduced compensation from a state fund as compared to a private operator. Emphasizing that the Louisiana provision acts as a liability transfer, not a liability waiver, the court concluded that petitioners’ theory “stretches attenuation and speculation far beyond their breaking points.”

The ruling comes at a time when states and the EPA have shown increased interest in states efficiently obtaining primacy over Class VI wells. For example, EPA has removed expectations that Class VI state regulatory packages include explicit consideration of environmental justice, which, under the Biden administration EPA had led to delays in EPA approvals. Nine states are currently in the process of applying for Class VI primacy (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah). Earlier this month, EPA proposed to approve Arizona’s application for primacy over all UIC well classes, including Class VI (the comment period for this proposal closes on July 3, 2025). EPA also recently reached a Memorandum of Agreement with the Texas Railroad Commission regarding the commission’s plan to administer the state’s Class VI program, indicating a proposed primacy approval is likely forthcoming. These states would join the four other states that have obtained Class VI primacy thus far: North Dakota (2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2024), and West Virginia (2025).

What action is the District taking?

The Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District is opening a public comment period June 1, 2025, regarding an RFG Opt-Out Request Including a Non-Interference Demonstration for the Kentucky Counties of Jefferson, Bullitt, and Oldham.

Summary of proposal

The Governor of Kentucky has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requesting to opt-out of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program in the Louisville RFG Area, which includes Jefferson County, as well as parts of Bullitt and Oldham Counties. If approved, Jefferson, Bullitt, and Oldham Counties would no longer be required to use reformulated gasoline, a type of fuel originally developed to burn cleaner than conventional gasoline.

Kentucky opted into the RFG program in the 1990s in an effort to improve air quality and meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, conventional gasoline has significantly improved and the difference between RFG and conventional gas has narrowed.

The District is requesting EPA’s approval of its proposed Non-Interference Demonstration showing that the removal of RFG will not impact the area’s ability to meet air quality standards, as the area will be replacing the emission reduction benefit from RFG with permanent, enforceable emission reductions due to the closure of LG&E Mill Creek Unit 1.

How can I comment on this action?

You can comment in writing using the online public comment form(link is external), or by mail to Regulatory Coordinator, Lauren Robbins, Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, 701 W. Ormsby Ave., Suite 303, Louisville, Kentucky 40203, until 5:00 p.m., July 2, 2025. Verbal statements will be accepted at a public hearing, if one is requested, via Video Teleconference, with an option to attend in the Edison Room of the Edison Center at 701 West Ormsby Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40203, on Wednesday, July 2, 2025, at 6:00 PM.

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced the implementation of emergency permitting procedures to expeditiously review geothermal energy projects critical for U.S. national security and Energy Dominance. This action is part of the Department’s efforts to address the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025.

By streamlining environmental reviews, the Department aims to accelerate geothermal projects that address urgent national security and energy needs while maintaining environmental stewardship.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

Several proposed geothermal projects led by Ormat Nevada, Inc. will be among the first geothermal projects covered by the Department’s new emergency permitting procedures:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada) – Ormat plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased land to determine whether the geothermal reservoir is commercially viable.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada) – This effort involves upgrading and expanding three existing geothermal power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 MW solar photovoltaic field. These improvements aim to increase efficiency and boost output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada) – Ormat is evaluating geothermal potential on leased public lands through test drilling and exploration activities.

These proposed projects pursue the kind of reliable and strategically important energy development the Department seeks to accelerate—supporting both national defense and domestic energy resilience. Once the Bureau of Land Management completes its environmental assessments within a 14-day timeframe, it will determine whether Ormat’s proposed projects can move forward.

The Bureau of Land Management oversees geothermal development on federal lands by leasing sites to companies, conducting environmental reviews, and issuing permits for exploration and production. The bureau ensures projects comply with environmental and safety standards, balances geothermal development with other land uses and manages royalties from operations. Essentially, BLM manages and regulates geothermal resources to promote responsible energy development on public lands.

The Department is using emergency authorities under existing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act. Interior has prepared a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the emergency procedures. Project proponents interested in requesting emergency coverage should contact their regular points of contact at the pertinent field, district or state office.

So far the Trump administration has publicly announced plans to fire nearly 300 staff working on DEI or environmental justice issues at the end of July. These records show that a major reorganization has already taken place at the agency behind the scenes.

“The EPA can’t protect American health while losing 10% of its staff in a matter of months. And more firings are planned by the Trump administration,” said Ivan Ditmars, associate attorney at the Center. “Without the scientists and researchers to maintain strong health and environmental standards, polluters will profit while the rest of us suffer from dirtier air and water. As Trump stops policing pollution, we can expect more asthma attacks, lead contamination and all the other harms that EPA experts strive to prevent.”

EPA records show a list of more than 17,700 employees in 2024, compared to nearly 16,200 employees at the end of April. The agency has not revealed which divisions have been most affected by the staff reductions.

Other estimates of the EPA’s staffing numbers have focused on its “core workforce” but the new records appear to cover much or all of the agency’s entire staff.

The speed of the almost 10% cut in staffing is unprecedented. Past declines under Reagan, Bush and the first Trump administration were much more gradual.

“Past cuts hurt the EPA a lot, but at least they occurred slowly enough that the agency had time to adapt. Trump is now pushing people out in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible,” Ditmars said.

Since the start of Trump’s second term, the Center has submitted numerous FOIA requests seeking information on the administration’s mass firings and anti-regulatory plans. In cases in which the Trump administration ignores the requests, the Center has sued for the public records.

That’s because the U.S. power sector is a major source of climate pollution.
The 3% problem Section 111 of the Clean Air Act doesn’t set a threshold above which sectors are deemed to contribute “significantly” to climate pollution.
In other words, the U.S. power sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the national emissions of most countries.
“This is a matter of statutory interpretation,” said Joe Goffman, who served as EPA air chief in the Biden administration.","EPA is expected to soon argue that the U.S. power sector doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change — a bid that could give the agency cover to not regulate planet-warming emissions from a wide range of sources.

EPA included the argument in its draft repeal of Biden-era rules to limit pollution from power plants, according to two people briefed by EPA personnel and granted anonymity to discuss those conversations. The agency bolsters its argument by stating in the draft sent to the White House that U.S. fossil fuel power plants account for 3 percent of global emissions, The New York Times reported last week.

The assertion would take advantage of a section of the Clean Air Act that instructs the EPA administrator to decide whether a category of sources contributes enough harmful pollution to warrant regulation. That could offer a backdoor avenue for EPA to stop regulating most climate pollution — one where the agency has to clear a lower legal bar than overturning the so-called endangerment finding that underpins all Clean Air Act climate regulations.

Industry attorneys who have expressed skepticism about the Trump administration’s broader assault on climate science see some merit in a more targeted approach under Section 111.

“We’ve been telling folks for a while that we thought it was easier for them to make a run at the power sector or the oil and gas sector than the vehicle sector, just because of the word ‘significantly’ in the statute,” said Jeff Holmstead, who served as EPA air chief under former President George W. Bush.

But if EPA’s bid to label power plants as insignificant contributors to harmful pollution survives the inevitable legal challenges, it could absolve the agency from regulating a wide range of stationary emissions sources under Section 111.

That’s because the U.S. power sector is a major source of climate pollution. Declaring that it doesn’t contribute “significantly” to pollution could rule out regulation of any source category that emits less pollution — which would be nearly all of them.

“If the courts agree that greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector do not ‘significantly contribute’ to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare, then this would prevent EPA from regulating greenhouse emissions from any industrial sector,” said Holmstead.

Transportation would be a notable exception. It emits more and is regulated under a different section of the law, so the move wouldn’t affect tailpipe emissions rules.

If the courts agree with EPA’s proposed threshold for what constitutes a “significant” contribution, that could also create hurdles for future administrations, experts said.

“They may well get a judicial decision on what it means to contribute significantly under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act,” said Jonathan Adler, a conservative legal scholar and founding director of Case Western Reserve University’s environmental law center. “That would potentially lock that in place. Not just for power plants, but arguably for other stationary source categories.”

Coal- and gas-fired power plants released 31 percent of domestic CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion in 2023, according to EPA’s own emissions inventory, which the Environmental Defense Fund released this month after obtaining it via a Freedom of Information Act request. That’s more than any other source category except transportation.

EPA’s inventory showed that industrial energy use collectively accounted for 26.3 percent of CO2 from fossil fuels combustion in 2023 — a significant share of emissions but less than the power sector.

The 3% problem

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act doesn’t set a threshold above which sectors are deemed to contribute “significantly” to climate pollution.

The New York Times’ reporting hints that EPA may be preparing to propose “3 percent of global emissions” as that threshold, but experts agree that the agency would need to give a strong justification for choosing that as the cutoff.

Only six economies emit more than 3 percent of global emissions, comprising China, the United States, India, the European Union, Russia and Brazil. In other words, the U.S. power sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the national emissions of most countries.

EPA also has the challenge of seeking to introduce this threshold — for the first time in the Clean Air Act’s 50-year history — a year after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision to sharply limit the degree of deference courts afford to agencies in interpreting vaguely worded statutes. The Loper Bright v. Raimondo decision upended a decades-old legal precedent known as the Chevron doctrine that directed courts to give agencies the benefit of the doubt in their “reasonable” interpretations of laws when Congress’ intent was unclear.

“This is a matter of statutory interpretation,” said Joe Goffman, who served as EPA air chief in the Biden administration. “I think at least in passing, they will regret the demise of Chevron deference.”

Holmstead noted that EPA would benefit from statutory language that instructs the EPA administrator to decide “in his judgment” whether a source category contributes significantly to harmful pollution.

Robert Sussman, who served as senior policy counsel at EPA during the Obama administration, said that EPA would also need to explain a rule from Trump’s first term — which was never implemented — that sought to make 3 percent of domestic greenhouse gas emissions the threshold for a finding of significant contribution under Section 111.

That’s a much lower bar than 3 percent of global emissions, and EPA said explicitly at the time that the power sector qualified as contributing significantly.

“They would need to demonstrate why the rule that they themselves promulgated in the first term no longer represents their thinking,” Sussman said.

The Trump EPA’s strategy on endangerment shows it trying to avoid a frontal assault on climate science, relying instead on “a fairly narrow legal formulation that they can apply without much effort,” said Sussman.

The administration hasn’t devoted any time to building an alternative scientific record to support its bid to overturn the foundational scientific finding — as it considered doing during Trump’s first term. Less than a month after inauguration day, EPA sent the White House recommendations for upending the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding, which declared that greenhouse gas emissions endangered public health and welfare. The power plant repeal proposal followed a couple of months later.

But Sussman said the agency would need to provide analysis based on science for the criteria it proposes for sources that “contribute significantly.”

“They will actually have to, I think, get into the science of climate change here in order to have an intelligent position on what is a ‘significant contribution,’” he said. “If you just pick a number out of the air — like 3 percent — how can that number be meaningful without regard to the context of the pollution problem that you’re trying to address?”

Environmental lawyers see another statutory problem. EPA has always considered all the pollution from a source category — like power plants or oil refineries — when interpreting Section 111. That means the agency might have to argue that U.S. power plants don’t contribute significantly to any harmful pollution, not just planet-warming emissions, to undo its 1971 decision to list fossil fuel power plants under Section 111.

“Administratively, this is a through line of EPA’s interpretation,” said Patrick A. Parenteau, a senior fellow of climate policy in the Environmental Law Center at Vermont Law School.

The Biden EPA did discuss the greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants as part of the carbon rule it finalized last year. It stated the sector was responsible for 4 percent of global heat-trapping emissions, based on 2021 data. But Goffman said that information was included at EPA’s discretion, not because Section 111 required a separate significant contribution finding for power plant carbon emissions.

But Holmstead said courts have never weighed in on whether that EPA interpretation is the best reading of the statute. And he said he thought the Trump administration was right to argue — as it likely will — that the statute requires a dedicated finding for each pollutant, not just for source categories.

“It doesn’t make any sense to say that EPA can regulate any pollutant that it wants, even if there’s no sense in regulating it,” he said. “I don’t always agree with the legal positions of this administration, but I think they’re right on this one.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2d/fd/cff4321740ce8ab15d93341ced5c/trump-epa-coal-ash-66474.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:24.777011

The tunnel project, fast-tracked by the Trump administration, aims to house the Line 5 pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac.

Great Lakes tribes and environmental groups oppose the project, citing concerns about the aging pipeline's safety and potential environmental impact.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a long-awaited draft of its environmental review for Enbridge's Line 5 Tunnel project through the Straits of Mackinac.

Although the draft is not an official decision, it gives the an idea of how the agency views the project. The Corps is accepting public comments through June with a decision expected in the fall.

The Great Lakes Tunnel Project was fast-tracked earlier this spring as a part of the Trump administration's goal to ""unleash"" American oil and gas. Canadian-headquartered Enbridge has proposed to build a tunnel to house its Line 5 pipeline through the 4 1/2 mile stretch separating Lakes Michigan and Huron.

The Army Corps' Detroit District, which is overseeing the permitting process, said it will not eliminate any steps in the environmental review process. But Great Lakes tribes and environmental groups remain unconvinced that the aged-out pipeline can continue to operate safely through the world's largest surface freshwater system.

Several Great Lakes tribes withdrew as cooperating agencies in the review process, saying that the federal agency was not acting in good faith. Tribal leaders claimed the process lacked meaningful dialogue and undermined the federal government’s responsibility to protect tribal treaty rights.

The draft spans hundreds of pages, evaluating the necessity of the proposed project and examining potential environmental impacts while also reviewing possible alternatives. It considered two main alternatives, which included denying permits and allowing the existing pipeline to operate under the Straits as is, or placing a protective cover over the portions that are currently exposed. It also considered changing the tunnel's design and decommissioning the pipeline entirely.

Officials from the Corps concluded that the project is warranted, citing projections that demand for the petroleum products transported by the pipeline will either remain stable or grow over the next 25 years.

The tunnel will be bored upwards of 250 feet under the lakebed

Over the years in the Straits of Mackinac, Line 5 has experienced anchor strikes, missing supports and coating loss, exposing patches of bare metal.

The tunnel became possible after a review by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who in his final month of office when he created the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority. The corridor authority signed 99-year lease agreement with Enbridge to continue operations of the Line 5 tunnel. Enbridge has said the Great Lakes Tunnel will nearly eliminate the risks of a pipeline incident.

The tunnel will be bored into rock 60 to 250 feet under the lakebed, using a tunnel boring machine that will move the tunnel forward 40 feet per day on average. It will be constructed the south side of the Straits to the northern shores, which Enbridge says minimizes environmental impacts.

The tunnel will be owned and operated by Michigan, and leased to the company.

Great Lakes tribes, environmentalists argue risks are too great

The Great Lakes Tunnel Project also needs two state permits, one from Michigan’s Public Service Commission and the other from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. Enbridge has secured the permit from the public service commission, but must redo the permitting process with the environment and energy agency given new information on nearby wetlands.

The permit from the state public service commission was challenged by tribes, but that challenge was struck down earlier this year. On April 2, tribes and environmental groups asked the state Supreme Court to consider overturning the lower court's decision.

Line 5 opponents have long worried about the risks the pipeline poses to the Great Lakes. The pipeline, which was built in 1953, was built to last 50 years, and leaked 35 times during its tenure. Environmentalists and Great Lakes tribes warn of risks at the Straits of Mackinac, which is seen as the worst place in the region for an oil spill and sacred to Anishinaabe tribes. They also cite threats to nearby wetlands and explosion risks within the tunnel.

The Line 6 oil spill that occurred late last year in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, has heightened these fears.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an international think tank, released a report earlier this year that said that shutting down the pipeline would be a more cost-effective avenue for the company as that the tunnel will likely cost three times the initial estimate due to inflation and rising costs.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/19/PMJS/83729203007-mjs-enbridge-3.jpg?crop=8493,4777,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 12:24:30.381658

These new battery chemistries often require multiple stages of coating, cutting and handling. For example, solid-state electrode production involves coating a base material with active components, followed by a second layer of insulating material. This layered structure offers enhanced performance but also introduces more friction-heavy processing steps, each of which risks introducing particulate contamination. The presence of static charge further exacerbates this, as it causes particles to be attracted to sensitive surfaces, where they can become embedded and difficult to remove.

“Process engineers are under pressure to optimise both the chemistry and efficiency of these emerging technologies” said Ian Atkinson, board member and sales director at Meech International. “But they’re not always specialists in static and contamination control - so problems can occur before they're even recognised.”

Contamination at sub-micron levels can affect stacking accuracy, reduce cycle life, and even compromise safety. In some cases, electrostatic charge builds up on insulating materials or carrier films, leading to sticking, misalignment, and reduced line speeds in automated processes.

Meech recommends integrating advanced surface cleaning and static control measures as early as possible in the design and production process. For example, technologies that use airflow dynamics to extract particles below 1 μm without touching the substrate are already being adopted by major manufacturers.

These systems maintain pristine surface conditions throughout high-speed production lines while minimising waste and eliminating the need for inconsistent or manual interventions.

And you, what do you think of the stop-start system?","The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has spoken, and what was once an open secret now makes much more sense: stop-start systems in cars are useless. No, they’re not useful, they were supposedly designed to reduce fuel consumption when the car is idle but, let’s be honest, they’re pretty annoying.

Now, the Trump administration has launched a crusade against these systems, which have been added to cars for more than 15 years. The EPA argues that they provide little or no real benefit in terms of emissions and that all they really do is wear down engine components.

What stop-start systems were supposed to promise

The idea was simple: eliminate fuel consumption during idling (when the car is stopped but still on, like at traffic lights or yield signs), especially in urban environments.

This practice became popular in the early 2000s, when the U.S. Department of Energy and Argonne National Laboratory claimed that a car could consume up to half a gallon per hour while idling.

They also claimed that automatically turning off the engine when the vehicle stops and turning it back on when it moves again could save between 4% and 10% of fuel in the city… far from reality.

Included in every car

Although it started as a premium feature, today 65% of cars sold in the USA have this system, compared to just 1% in 2012. In Europe and Japan, the number goes beyond 90%! And although it’s not legally required, manufacturers receive fuel economy credits for including it, and where there’s money, well, we know how that goes.

The EPA hits the brakes

Now, after years of research, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the system barely reduces emissions and causes premature wear on the starter motor (which makes sense, it starts more often, even several times within an hour).

Although many tons of CO₂ savings have been estimated annually, the reality is that this system had many shortcomings, starting with the fact that it’s uncomfortable and annoying. And honestly… the fuel savings weren’t that great, estimated between 4% and 5%.

Was it really that annoying?

It was said that this system worked better in dense urban commutes, obviously, there are more stops than on a regular highway, where the system is irrelevant. Still, it’s annoying. Many drivers deactivate it due to discomfort or fear of it failing. The early versions were clunky and slow, and although they’ve improved, people still don’t like them.

The future of stop-start: end of the road?

It’s clear that brands started adding this system because of the incentives (not because they liked it) but now, if the EPA removes the credits that reward its use, brands will likely choose to eliminate it from future models.

Especially now that we’re moving closer to an electric future, something that would make this system obsolete and unnecessary.

Failed bet?

At the time, they represented an attempt to reduce emissions, but now that electrification and hydrogen are just around the corner, we can say that these stop-start systems did their job and can now be put to rest (finally).

What did the experts say?

According to Consumer Reports, for example, it depended on the specific vehicle. They pointed out the pros and cons of the system but admitted that in many cases the system was inconsistent and, as we’ve said, very annoying.

We’ll have to wait and see if this is a final goodbye (at least in our country, because Europe and China will probably continue using it) and whether we’ll miss it or feel relieved.

And you, what do you think of the stop-start system? Did you find it annoying too?",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/epa-trump-stop-start-system.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:14:22.433497

Meanwhile, E&E News reported that DOE is evaluating clean energy loan values for potential sale, signaling the office could shutter altogether.
Rolling back these standards could flood the market with outdated, energy-wasting products, driving up energy costs for millions.
As with his tariff threats, the uncertainty over whether permits will be honored undermines the confidence needed to finance clean energy projects.
Blocking these grants hampers clean energy development, particularly in communities that need lower energy costs the most.","Action: Invoking emergency powers under the 1935 Federal Power Act, former fossil fuel executive and current Secretary of Energy Chris Wright ordered a Michigan coal plant slated to close at the end of May to remain open, citing the potential for an energy emergency that doesn’t exist.

Impact: The move builds on a prior Trump executive order allowing DOE to cite grid reliability as a reason to force coal plants to remain open. Fossil Fuel enthusiast Chris Wright leaned on that rationale, warning of a potential summer energy emergency. But Michigan Public Service Commission chair Dan Scripps told The Detroit News that the state already produces more power than it needs, calling the DOE’s order “unnecessary” and warning it will raise costs for homes and businesses across the Midwest. MISO, the grid operator for Michigan and 14 other Midwest states, also confirmed last month it has “sufficient capacity” heading into summer. If Trump’s manufactured emergency were real, his own efforts to stall clean energy would only make it worse. Whether it’s using executive powers to block clean energy or abusing emergency authority to prop up the dying coal industry, the result is the same: Trump is forcing Americans to subsidize his fossil fuel cronies’ profits.

Action: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had taken a key step to reverse Biden-era fuel economy rules designed to save Americans money and reduce pollution.

Impact: In his first official move as Transportation Secretary, Duffy signed a memo acknowledging Trump’s policy of promoting fossil fuel use and initiating the rollback. He falsely claimed that the standards, along with a nonexistent federal “EV mandate,” are making cars unaffordable. In reality (something the former Real World star should be familiar with), the standards don’t even take effect until 2027, making his claim laughable on its face. The fuel economy rules now on the chopping block are projected to save drivers more than $23 billion in fuel costs, or roughly $600 per vehicle over its lifetime. Rolling them back, a top priority of fossil fuel companies, means less efficient cars and higher prices at the pump for American drivers.

Action: Trump’s EPA continued its push to illegally terminate $20 billion in clean energy grants, stalling projects funded through the GGRF’s National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator in low-income communities. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has claimed, without evidence, that the terminations were justified by misconduct and fraud. But The New York Times reported that a federal investigation may have ended after turning up no evidence of wrongdoing.

Impact: The terminations froze critical funding and halted projects aimed at lowering costs in communities that need it most. In Michigan, plans to build and renovate energy-efficient rental housing to address a severe housing shortage are now at risk, as developers can’t access the capital they were promised. This leaves more Michiganders unable to afford to live where they work. Millions more in funding for cost-saving measures, like insulating older homes, are also now on the chopping block.

Action: Trump’s DOE launched a sweeping “review” of 179 Biden-era awards, totaling more than $15 billion, signaling potential terminations. Days later, Semafor reported that the first cuts could target loans issued by the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO). And on May 29, the department officially canceled its first LPO loan.

Impact: The review casts serious doubt over key clean energy projects. Under Biden, the LPO approved more than 50 deals worth over $100 billion, including a major loan to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) expected to deliver $100 million in annual savings to 5.5 million Californians. But with rising costs from Trump’s tariffs and mounting uncertainty over the promised loan, PG&E says it can no longer factor in those savings, meaning customers will foot the bill. Other utilities, including those in Michigan, face similar risks. Meanwhile, E&E News reported that DOE is evaluating clean energy loan values for potential sale, signaling the office could shutter altogether.

Action: Trump’s DOE proposed repealing or weakening more than two dozen efficiency standards, including for appliances, claiming the move would save Americans more than $11 billion.

Impact: The DOE’s own analysis shows the move would increase utility bills by more than $54 billion, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. Rolling back these standards could flood the market with outdated, energy-wasting products, driving up energy costs for millions.

Action: The New York Times reported that Trump’s EPA plans to terminate the ENERGY STAR program, a widely used labeling system that helps consumers identify energy-efficient appliances.

Impact: Though ENERGY STAR is authorized under the Clean Air Act and cannot be unilaterally scrapped, the move aligns with Trump’s efforts to dismantle environmental programs in favor of fossil fuel interests. The program costs just $32 million annually but saves consumers over $40 billion each year on utility bills. In March, dozens of companies urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to protect ENERGY STAR. They warned that eliminating it “will not serve the American people,” especially as electricity demand is set to surge in the years ahead.

Action: According to a court filing reported by The Washington Post, the EPA plans to cancel all grants issued by its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, nearly 800 in total. The filing came just days after reports that the EPA would fire every staffer working on environmental justice.

Impact: Although the agency is required to conduct a detailed review of each grant before termination, experts say the EPA has yet to provide evidence that any such reviews have taken place and may have misled the court. If finalized, the cancellations would strip funding from vulnerable communities working to lower energy costs and protect residents from air and water pollution, halting critical progress towards healthier, more affordable communities.

Action: Citing Trump’s fake day one “energy emergency” declaration, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track approvals for fossil fuels on public lands, claiming the declaration allows it to radically slash environmental review timelines required by bedrock environmental laws.

Impact: Despite expert consensus that no such energy emergency exists, Trump is cutting project review timelines from a year to just 14 days, effectively eliminating public input opportunities. While nearly all new electricity supply last year came from renewables, Trump paused new solar and wind approvals on federal land and waters, just one of many actions he’s taken to deliberately slow clean energy deployment (while he later resumed review of solar projects, wind approvals remain paused and developers report that lack of agency staff is impacting project financing, purchasing, and construction start dates). Ironically, his fake energy emergency risks creating a real one. By sidelining clean energy and locking in costly fossil fuels, permitting laws and environmental reviews be damned, utilities will pass rising costs on to consumers. This is just as electricity demand is surging.

Action: The Trump administration ordered Equinor to halt construction of its fully permitted Empire Wind 1 farm, claiming, without evidence, that its underlying environmental analysis was rushed.

Impact: Although the Trump administration later allowed construction to resume, the abrupt halt sent a chilling message to investors: under Trump, even fully permitted projects aren’t safe. As with his tariff threats, the uncertainty over whether permits will be honored undermines the confidence needed to finance clean energy projects. This jacks up costs that will ultimately get passed on to American households.

Action: Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the DOE to prevent coal plants from shutting down, even if they violate environmental rules or drive up power costs.

Impact: Coal is the dirtiest and most expensive source of electricity on the grid. Trump’s order not only overrides state authority to regulate utilities, but it also forces consumers to foot the bill for aging, uneconomical plants. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has even floated restarting already shuttered coal plants. The result: Polluters rake in guaranteed profits while Americans get stuck with higher energy bills. All while cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable alternatives are available.

Action: The Trump administration abruptly fired the entire staff overseeing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the $4.1 billion program that helps low-income families afford their utility bills. Weeks later, the White House proposed cutting the program entirely.

Impact: LIHEAP helps families pay for heating oil, weatherize homes, and avoid utility shutoffs. With no staff to distribute remaining funds, despite a congressional mandate to do so, advocates warned millions could be left without aid. The Department of Health and Human Services briefly rehired one employee to release the final round of funding, but the next day, Trump’s budget proposed eliminating the program altogether, calling it “unnecessary.” More than 6 million households could now face reduced or eliminated benefits, leaving them unable to afford basic heating or cooling.

Action: Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country across the globe, including our allies, claiming they’ve maintained unfair trade relationships with the U.S.

Impact: Even as the White House has walked back some tariffs (for now), and the Courts are considering the legality of Trump’s authority to impose them, much of the damage was already done. Energy markets have been thrown into turmoil. U.S. liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) is now positioned as a bargaining chip, after Trump floated that Europe could avoid tariffs by buying more American gas. Trading partners may ramp up purchase commitments to rebalance trade. This could potentially trigger volatile swings in household energy bills. Meanwhile, the ongoing uncertainty around Trump’s tariff whims is worsening supply chain disruptions for key electrical components. This is slowing the buildout of renewable energy and critical grid infrastructure and driving costs higher for new and existing projects.

Action: On his first day back in office, Trump lifted the freeze on LNG export approvals. His DOE later removed a major regulatory hurdle, further unleashing fossil fuel companies’ ability to sell gas overseas.

Impact: Even before Trump’s election, North American gas exports, driven by new U.S. projects, were on track to more than double by 2028. According to E&E News, EIA expects LNG-driven demand to push prices higher this year and next. Easing the path for new export projects means more gas going overseas—and higher energy costs at home.

Action: As Trump’s EPA shuts down environmental justice programs, all of the grants under the CCGP, including a project that installs solar panels in low-income neighborhoods, are under review, and some are “already slated to be terminated.”

Impact: Terminating this program blocks cost-saving clean energy projects in disadvantaged communities overburdened by pollution and more significant climate risks, keeping energy bills high. Terminating this program risks the future of projects that are lowering utility costs, as well as providing clean drinking water and disaster shelters in disadvantaged communities. For example, New Haven, Connecticut, planned to use $20 million in community change grants to help low-income residents cut energy costs with energy-efficient home upgrades—but Trump’s freeze has left that funding in limbo.

Action: Trump’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), at the direction of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, eliminated GRRP, which funds energy efficiency upgrades in affordable housing.

Impact: Cutting this program raises energy costs for thousands of low-income renters, especially seniors and families in federal-assisted housing. The GRRP funds urgent repairs to keep tens of thousands of affordable housing units livable, including energy efficiency improvements like replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems and aging insulation or windows. Projects using the funds are required to keep units affordable for up to 25 years. They also leverage funds to secure other investments for significant repairs and renovations “Projects will fail,” said one affordable housing developer, “And these are projects that are already difficult to finance.”

Action: Trump imposed a national tariff tax on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico, including on Canadian energy imports, triggering price spikes. While he’s temporarily delayed some tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, a 10% national tariff tax on energy imported from Canada remains in place.

Impact: Trump’s national tariff tax will ultimately raise prices for all American consumers, with midwestern states hit the hardest. Because energy infrastructure like pipelines and refineries are slow to adapt, imports of foreign fuels are likely to continue with higher costs passed on to consumers. That means higher gas prices and fewer, more expensive clean energy projects. In states like Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, gas prices are expected to jump up to 50 cents per gallon. And, heating bills will climb as tariffs on methane gas from Canada, America’s largest supplier, get passed down to households.

Action: Trump’s EPA blocked $20 billion in grants from the GGRF’s National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator programs, which fund clean energy projects in low-income communities. On March 11, the EPA attempted to formally (if not legally) revoke grants from those programs.

Impact: The purpose of GGRF programs is to lower energy costs for everyday Americans. Blocking these grants hampers clean energy development, particularly in communities that need lower energy costs the most. For example, the Climate United NEXT grant program helps communities historically left behind deploy clean energy projects that reduce pollution and cut energy bills. The Power Forward Communities grant program finances energy efficiency upgrades that help lower housing costs and utility bills while expanding and preserving affordable housing. While a federal court has blocked Trump’s EPA from illegally clawing back these grants for now, Trump’s efforts to terminate the program have left that funding in limbo and delayed projects that would deliver cost savings for the communities that need it most. It’s part of a broader “starve the beast” strategy: by dragging out uncertainty, they’re trying to force organizations to run out of funding and collapse.

Action: Trump’s day one executive order also froze funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, cutting support for building Electric Vehicle charging stations. After multiple federal judges blocked the administration’s efforts to gut the program, Trump’s Department of Transportation once again attempted to sabotage the NEVI program with an illegal power grab thinly disguised as a bureaucratic update.

Impact: Without this federal investment, rural communities in states like Ohio and Texas will struggle to build charging infrastructure, making it harder for residents to switch to cost-saving EVs. Fewer EVs on the road means higher demand for gasoline, driving up prices at the pump for everyone—hittingdrivers in rural communities and working families hardest. The uncertainty around federal investment also threatens the auto industry in states like Michigan, where billions have been invested to attract EV manufacturing. Industry leaders point to a lack of publicly accessible chargers as one major barrier to domestic demand. Trump’s NEVI sabotage undermines efforts like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal to install 100,000 chargers by 2030, slowing EV adoption, threatening the state’s clean energy economy and thousands of high-quality jobs in the state.

Action: Trump froze federal leasing for new offshore wind projects and onshore projects on federal lands and blocked permits for in-progress projects.

Impact: Delaying these projects reduces future grid capacity and raises electricity prices by ensuring that supply can’t keep up with growing energy demand. Coastal states are counting on gigawatts of energy from offshore wind and are now scrambling to fill the gap to avoid brownouts. Thousands of jobs have been lost or are at risk because of these project cancellations and delays. And, increased uncertainty in the wind energy market is driving higher costs for new and existing projects.

Urge Your Senators to Protect Clean Energy Programs in the Federal Budget

House Republicans have passed their disastrous budget bill that cuts lifesaving programs like SNAP and Medicaid and takes billions of dollars in climate funding away from households, workers, disadvantaged communities, businesses, and more—so they can give that money directly to the ultra-wealthy and corporations. As Republicans attempt to fast-track it through the Senate, urge Democrats in the Senate to hold strong and not give an inch.

""Trump calls this a big beautiful bill, it's big all right, but big in bad ways,"" Sen. Schumer said. ""Yep, big energy price increases for small businesses and families, big job losses throughout America, big win for China.""

The bill in senate right now, in part would cut federal energy investments. New York Companies use that investment to lower energy costs, create more jobs, and bring manufacturing back in the United States.

Schumer specifically highlighted how the bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families in New York up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have ensured a robust buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies.
On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.","A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available. Chevron didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, Ted Boutrous, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F22%2F51ec358e477dad10b50725079666%2Fgettyimages-2185677781.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 12:23:52.824657

“To Ford Motor Company, it is not acceptable to rely on buying batteries from China forever,” Bill Ford said in a statement.
That is why we’re building a new battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, so battery assembly can be done by American workers right here.
Additionally, the bill is aiming to rescind existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond.
Of further concern to Ford is the fact that this bill is aiming to rescind unobligated funding that supports the manufacture of certain advanced technology vehicles.","Back in January – amid reports that President Donald Trump was eyeing the possibility of killing off the federal EV tax credit – Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that such a move would have a “a significant impact” on the industry, and not just in terms of making the act of purchasing EVs more expensive for consumers that qualify. Rather, the under-construction BlueOval Battery Park Michigan site, which is slated to build lithium iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries for future EVs, is dependent on those funds as well. Now that it seems more likely that the EV tax credit is in fact going away, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford is speaking out on the matter, too.

“To Ford Motor Company, it is not acceptable to rely on buying batteries from China forever,” Bill Ford said in a statement. “We’re America’s top auto producer and we’ve always built in America. That is why we’re building a new battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, so battery assembly can be done by American workers right here. The House bill puts this at risk. Congress can make a decision to either force the U.S. to remain dependent on China or enter a new era of American independence and innovation.”

As Ford Authority reported earlier this month, a group of House Republicans introduced a bill that proposes killing off the federal EV tax credit, as well as repealing fuel efficiency rules. If the bill passes, it would end the $7,500 new EV tax credit and $4,000 used credit at the conclusion of 2025, though automakers that haven’t sold 200,000 electric vehicles would continue to qualify for the credit for an additional year. Additionally, the bill is aiming to rescind existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond.

One thing that the bill isn’t aiming to get rid of are battery production tax credits for automakers and battery makers, though it would add a provision that bars credits for vehicles that utilize components made by Chinese companies or using licensed technology from that country starting in 2027 – a major sticking point for Ford, which plans to utilize licensed LFP battery tech from China-based CATL at the under-construction BlueOval Battery Park Michigan site.

The rule – proposed by the Biden administration last July – would require companies to offer outdoor workers paid water and rest breaks above certain temperatures, the article explains.
By awarding both projects the status of “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, the planning process is elevated from a local level to a decision by the secretary of state, the article explains.
It notes that without new reservoirs, the government says national water supplies would “remain under threat” from population increases and the impacts of climate change.
The newspaper says this “could mean the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of investment in road, rail and green energy projects”.","More than $14bn in low-carbon US energy investments have either been cancelled or delayed this year according to analysis by clean-energy business group E2, reports the Associated Press. It says the group also estimates that losses since January have cost 10,000 new clean-energy jobs. The article continues that companies are “concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits”. These tax credits were boosted by former president Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), but many of its incentives would be “render[ed] moot” by the new bill if it passes in its current form, the outlet explains. E2 estimates that – excluding the cancellations – there have been $132bn in clean-energy plans announced since the IRA passed, the article adds. Nevertheless, Inside Climate News says the scale of cancellations since Donald Trump took office reflects businesses’ “uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid president Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat”. It says this trend marks an “ominous sign” as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s bill. Among the cancelled projects are a $3.3bn Stellantis battery plant in Illinois and RWE’s halting of offshore wind development in the US, according to E&E News. It says that, of the $14bn in halted projects, $4.5bn took place in April alone.

In related news, Ford executive chair Bill Ford has warned that the disappearance of tax credits for electric-car manufacturing would threaten the company’s projected $3bn investment in a Michigan plant that is already 60% complete and expected to employ 1,700 people, Reuters reports. Another Reuters story reports that solar panel maker Meyer Burger has closed a US factory in Arizona “due to financial troubles”. This article, too, mentions the wider context of the US government threatening incentives for clean-energy industries. Semafor says that as negotiations continue around the bill that could bring in tax credit cuts, the process could threaten “an even more important clean energy goal” – namely, permitting reform. Elon Musk’s company Tesla has issued a statement criticising the “Republican megabill” for cutting clean-energy tax credits, Politico says. It adds that this message was later “amplified” by Musk on his personal X account.

A group of 22 young people in the US have sued the Trump administration over executive orders that they say are “unconstitutional and would cripple the clean energy industry, suppress climate science and worsen global warming”, the New York Times reports. The plaintiffs are from Montana, Hawaii, Oregon and other states – and are represented by the NGO Our Children’s Trust, the article says. It explains: “The plaintiffs argue that they are already experiencing harms from a warming planet in the form of wildfires, drought and hurricanes, and that Trump’s executive orders will make conditions even worse.” The Guardian says the case is based on the idea that Trump’s executive orders “are violating [the plaintiffs’] constitutional rights to life and liberty”. The case also argues that the “federal government is engaging in unlawful executive overreach by breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health”, the article adds.

Meanwhile, Politico reports that the Supreme Court has ruled that federal agencies carrying out environmental reviews can take a more limited view of the impacts of transport and energy infrastructure projects, which does not take into account all “the climate effects of fossil fuels that move through them and will later be burned”. The article says: “The ruling follows years of complaints from industry and Republicans – and some Democrats – that National Environmental Policy Act reviews had ballooned in scope and become a legal hurdle in some cases.”

Finally, E&E News says the oil-and-gas industry is “pushing the Trump administration to kill a proposed rule that would protect workers from extreme heat”. The rule – proposed by the Biden administration last July – would require companies to offer outdoor workers paid water and rest breaks above certain temperatures, the article explains. Scientific American notes that the oil industry is “among the nation’s leading workplaces for heat-related deaths and injuries”.

A drought has been declared in north-west England, following the driest period on record across the country between February and April, the Guardian reports. Despite recent rain, the newspaper explains that the nation’s rivers are at “exceptionally low flows” and reservoir levels are declining. It notes: “Climate breakdown will make droughts more likely, scientists have said, as rainfall becomes less predictable.” The Independent reports that the UK has experienced its sunniest spring since records began. It adds that the current dry spell follows a period of extreme wet weather, with England experiencing its wettest 12 months on record up to September 2024. The Environment Agency has warned that there is a “medium” risk of drought across the whole of England this summer if there is not sustained rainfall, Sky News says.

This follows news that the government is “fast-tracking” plans for the first new UK reservoirs in three decades in Lincolnshire and East Anglia, BusinessGreen reports. By awarding both projects the status of “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, the planning process is elevated from a local level to a decision by the secretary of state, the article explains. It notes that without new reservoirs, the government says national water supplies would “remain under threat” from population increases and the impacts of climate change. Water minister Emma Hardy tells BBC News: “This is really important because if we don’t build the reservoirs, we’re going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.” The new projects are scheduled for completion in 2036 and 2040, the article says. The Times quotes an interview Hardy gave to Times Radio, in which she said that without new reservoirs people in the UK could face water restrictions similar to those seen in the Mediterranean. The article says that government plans for new homes and data centres place additional strain on water supplies. An opinion piece by Daily Telegraph columnist Henry Hill lambasts successive UK governments for not doing more to tackle drought. He does not mention climate change.

In more UK news, the Guardian reports that government advisors the Climate Change Committee (CCC) have stated that flexibilities announced by the government for the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate could lead to higher emissions. The changes could lead to more plug-in hybrids being sold at the expense of electric vehicles, which would limit emissions savings, the newspaper explains. In a story trailed on its frontpage, the i newspaper reports that Tesla has been pushing the UK government to “overhaul” a £2bn scheme that supports biofuels used in vehicles – the renewable transport fuel obligation – to “allow the electric car company access to the lucrative carbon credit market”.

Finally, the Times reports, in a frontpage story, that UK chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to announce a multibillion-pound investment package in the north and Midlands “to combat the threat of Reform” in the upcoming 11 June spending review. The newspaper says this “could mean the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of investment in road, rail and green energy projects”.

Wildfires in western Canada have now been declared emergencies in two provinces where thousands of people have fled their homes, BBC News reports. Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe has announced a state of emergency as 14 wildfires “rage uncontrollably” in the province, it explains. A state of emergency has also been declared in the province of Manitoba as multiple wildfires spread across nearly 200,000 hectares, the Globe and Mail reports. The area burned across the province this year is already triple the five-year annual average for Manitoba, the article adds. CBC News reports that thousands of First Nations people in northern Manitoba are among those that have been forced to evacuate. There are currently 134 active fires across Canada, half of which are “considered out of control”, including the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, according to Le Monde. The article quotes Manitoba premier Wab Kinew saying: “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.” In its coverage of the Canadian fires, CNN explains that “climate change is leading to an increase in wildfire risk days, as well as more frequent and larger fires that exhibit more extreme wildfire behaviour”.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that a “short-lived but punishing blast of intense heat” will hit the western US out to Saturday, with “temperatures rising to near-record values”. It adds: “The unusual intensity of high pressure is a marker of human-caused climate change.”

Finally, new analysis by scientists at World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre finds that half of the world’s population “endured an additional month of extreme heat over the past year because of man-made climate change”, according to Agence France-Presse.

France will push for China and the EU to take on “global climate leadership” during meetings of ecological transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher with Chinese officials and former climate envoy Xie Zhenhua in Beijing, Agence France-Presse reports. The newswire quotes an anonymous source saying the meetings aim to “see how, given the US withdrawal [from climate leadership], we can try to build a new convergence between the EU and China on climate”. Euractiv cites a member of Pannier-Runacher’s team saying it is “extremely important” for China and the EU to “send out a very strong message”, given “doubts” around “climate multilateralism and the COP system”. An article under the byline GT Voice in the state-supporting newspaper Global Times says “China-EU cooperation” in the electric vehicle supply chain will “bring greater certainty to the achievement of global carbon neutrality goals”.

Foreign minister Wang Yi pledged “increased support” to Pacific Island countries “in addressing climate change” at a recent summit, according to Reuters, including “100 ‘small but beautiful’ projects” and a $2m investment in “clean energy…[and] low-carbon infrastructure”. Wang said “China’s commitment” to global climate governance will “not waver” despite the “withdrawal of certain major countries from the Paris agreement”, Xinhua reports. The Communist party-affiliated People’s Daily publishes an article under the byline Zhong Sheng, a pen name indicating the article expresses party leadership’s views on global affairs, urging US-China science and technology cooperation to tackle “pressing” challenges such as climate change. China and African countries have built solar power stations with an installed capacity exceeding 1.5 gigawatts that could “power millions of African households”, another People’s Daily article says. A Global Times editorial notes that a summit held by China, ASEAN and the Gulf states, in which they agreed to “deepen cooperation…in energy security”, is an “event of major significance”.

Former finance vice-minister of finance Zhu Guangyao said that China’s emissions will likely “peak a few years ahead” of 2030, citing analysis in Carbon Brief, Bloomberg reports. Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng “called for greater efforts” to combat desertification, says state news agency Xinhua. Opinions issued by the State Council and Central Committee urged China to establish “sound trading systems for carbon emission rights” by 2027, stating China will shift from controlling carbon intensity to controlling total carbon emissions and increase allocation-based trading, BJX News says. China “ranked first in the world for nine years” in pumped-storage hydropower capacity, China Economic Daily reports. A major “clean-energy transmission line” in Inner Mongolia has been completed, state-run newspaper China Daily reports. Despite “relatively high production costs” and other challenges, hydrogen energy has “huge potential”, Ma Ding and Gao Zirui, professor postdoctoral fellow respectively at Peking University, write in the People’s Daily.

More than three-quarters of the world’s glaciers are on track to vanish “if climate change continues unchecked”, according to a new study covered by Agence France-Presse. Under existing climate policies, which would see temperatures rise 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, 76% of glacier mass would be gone, an outcome that would fuel sea-level rise and threaten water supplies for billions of people, the article says. However, it adds that if the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C target were reached, the study concludes that 54% of glacial mass could be preserved. Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and ETH Zurich who led the study, tells AFP that, given this potential to save glaciers, the findings should be seen as a “message of hope”. Other outlets take a different tack, with the New York Times headline reading: “Some glaciers will vanish no matter what, study finds.” The newspaper explains that “even if global temperatures stayed where they are today for the next thousand years, essentially an impossibility, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass”. It explains that glaciers are melting much faster than polar ice sheets in response to climate change, partly because they are smaller. The Guardian says that “almost 40% of glaciers in existence today are already doomed to melt due to climate-heating emissions from fossil fuels”. It says 75% of glaciers in the western US and Canada are “already doomed” to melt, while those in the higher, colder ranges of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges would be more resilient.

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that “the landslide that buried most of a Swiss village this week is focusing renewed attention on the role of global warming in glacier collapses around the world and the increasing dangers”. Finally, Atmos reports on “the mountain deity being lost to climate change”. It says tropical glaciers high in Uganda’s Rwenzori Mountains are rapidly melting, adding that for the Bakonzo people, “the loss is not only environmental – it’s displacing the mountain god who lives inside the ice”.

Elinor Bale from the Conservative Environment Network has an article in BusinessGreen arguing that the UK needs to focus more on developing nuclear power. She points to the government’s target of achieving clean electricity by 2030 and says “their ambition in tackling climate change so quickly is admirable, but the government’s approach risks setting itself up for failure”. Bale argues that, due to the focus on 2030, longer term planning has been deprioritised, writing: “Decisions on new energy projects that might not be ready until the next decade, such as nuclear, are being sent to the back of the queue despite their importance to decarbonising without increasing energy bills.” Bale points to the small modular nuclear reactor competition that is currently underway, but which she says has been “significantly delayed”. She acknowledges that the fault does not lie entirely with the relatively new Labour government, noting that there have been “endless delays on crucial nuclear decisions”. The article suggests measures to “streamline red tape” and boost nuclear power, including accepting reactor designs from “other trusted regulators” outside the UK, such as South Korea and France. Bale concludes: “Britain has a proud history when it comes to nuclear. We are in desperate need of consistent, green energy that provides our nation with security and economic growth. Nuclear ticks all these boxes.”

A Times editorial includes a swipe at the hard-right Reform UK party and its leader, Nigel Farage, specifically referencing the “fantasy economics” he has proposed in recent days. The newspaper says: “It must be great fun in Rothmans-puffing, covert-coated ­circles to josh about scrapping quangos, sacking diversity officers and junking everything to do with net-zero, whatever that means in practice…But it won’t pay the bill (we are talking more than the entire ­defence budget here) for raising the income tax threshold by £7,430 to £20,000.”",,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:35.747123

Speaking at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Mackinac Island, Ford said the company’s $3.5 billion investment and its plan to employ 1,700 workers hinge on production tax credits passed under former President Joe Biden’s climate law. Those incentives are now under threat as House Republicans move to roll them back through new legislation.

However, if the credits do not remain, they will have “imperil” impacts on the automakers’ Marshall battery facility. “We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” executive chairman Ford said.

The bill passed by the U.S. House earlier this month would eliminate tax credits for batteries made with Chinese technology after 2031. Ford’s factory, now under construction, plans to use technology from Chinese battery manufacturer CATL. The legislation still faces a vote in the Senate, where opposition remains strong among Democrats and some fiscally conservative Republicans.

Ford reiterated after the event that “nothing needs to change” about the tax credit, emphasizing that the Marshall project’s business case was built around it.

Initially announced in 2023, the Marshall plant was expected to produce enough battery capacity to support 400,000 EVs annually. Ford later revised that number to 230,000 vehicles due to softening demand. The company also accepted a reduced incentive package from the state of Michigan after lowering its output goals.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment — that, to me, is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ford-executive-chairman--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:19.616428

The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law.
The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

Keep up with all things West Michigan business.
The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has proposed eliminating duplicative exams, honoring trade licenses, giving entrepreneurs more flexibility and streamlining reporting requirements.
Republicans will also propose a new college scholarship program for every high school graduate who attends a Michigan university or college.
1 thing I’m hearing here at the (Mackinac Policy) conference is, ‘Are we going to get a budget done on time?","MACKINAC ISLAND — House Republicans will propose ways to overhaul Michigan’s “out-of-control” regulatory environment and look to create a new, more powerful legislative committee that could block or change rules written by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, Speaker Matt Hall said Wednesday.

During a news conference at the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Mackinac Policy Conference, the Republican spoke about state permitting reform, a topic the Democratic governor raised in her State of the State address. It is also top of mind following a recent fight between homebuilders and her administration over construction regulations that critics estimate will add around $15,000 to the price of a new home.

“We’re going to start reasserting the power of the Legislature on these regulations,” Hall said. “That will play out. We’ll introduce it. Hopefully the (Democratic-led) Senate will embrace it. But we really need a much stronger regulatory committee that can engage earlier in this process and actually continue to block these rules from taking effect or change them.”

The bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, which includes five Republicans and five Democrats, can give input on proposed regulations, but lawmakers often are ultimately powerless to stop them if an administration wants to put them in place.

A House-passed replacement for JCAR could run into opposition from the Senate and Whitmer. A message seeking comment was left with the governor’s spokespeople.

“Our regulatory situation is out of control,” Hall said. “A lot of the problems when you’re here at this conference and you’re talking to these business leaders, they stem from the fact that we’re over-regulated.”

The House point person on the initiative, Rep. Bill G. Schuette, R-Midland, alleged that it can sometimes take a business three times longer to get a permit in Michigan than in Ohio and Indiana. He noted lack of housing and child care as areas of particular concern and said projects are being unnecessarily delayed. He plans to release a report on the issue as soon as next week.

“It’ll be comprehensive. I think it’ll be really impactful for ways that we can really cut down on some red tape,” Schuette said.

In February, Whitmer said she would instruct state departments and agencies that had missed deadlines to refund any business permitting fees they can under the law. She also called for unspecified changes in law to speed “broken” permitting.

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has proposed eliminating duplicative exams, honoring trade licenses, giving entrepreneurs more flexibility and streamlining reporting requirements. Whitmer has said she would enact some of those changes on her own, but others would require new laws.

Hall said he agrees with “a lot” in the Whitmer administration’s report but wants to go further.

Also Wednesday, Republicans said they will propose increasing base K-12 funding, now $9,608 per student, to $12,000 by eliminating what are known as categorical funds that districts get for specific purposes. The idea is to “simplify” the budget and “get back to basics” by trusting school leaders to make decisions instead of lawmakers, said Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township.

Republicans will also propose a new college scholarship program for every high school graduate who attends a Michigan university or college. It would be $5,500 annually to attend a four-year school, $2,750 to go to community college. The state already offers a scholarship worth a similar amount, but students must demonstrate a financial need to qualify.

Hall said Republicans will present their budget “very soon.” The state Legislature is required to send the governor the next budget by July 1, but Hall has signaled it may not be finalized until later because Republicans are looking for cuts to boost road funding and cover a proposed income tax decrease. The start of the fiscal year is Oct. 1.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, whose caucus approved a plan two weeks ago, said it is “troubling” that the House has not passed its full budget proposal.

“The No. 1 thing I’m hearing here at the (Mackinac Policy) conference is, ‘Are we going to get a budget done on time?'” she said. “Not if the House doesn’t show up to negotiate.”

Powering Up

NuScale Power submitted its standard design application to the NRC on New Year’s Day back in 2023 seeking a power uprate to 77 MWe for each power module, with a total plant power output of 462 MWe.

The design builds on the company’s 50-MWe design, which was certified the same year, becoming just the seventh reactor design cleared for use in the United States by the NRC.

NuScale’s power plant can house to up to six factory-built power modules that together are about a third of the size of a large-scale reactor.

The advanced light-water systems leverage natural processes, such as convection and gravity, to passively cool the reactor without additional water, power, or even operator action.

The uprated power modules include the same safety features as NuScale’s 50 MWe design with some select design changes to meet the nation’s growing power demands while also improving the overall economics of building and operating the plant.

“NuScale is proud to have worked with the NRC and to have met its stringent regulatory application process as we continue to lead the way in the SMR industry with our second design approval,” said Carrie Fosaaen, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Services in a NuScale press release.

What’s Next

NuScale’s uprated power module design can now be referenced by companies when applying for combined licenses or construction permits to build the reactors on a specific site.

NuScale is currently performing front-end engineering work for RoPower’s 462-MWe power plant in Romania and has 12 power modules in production with its manufacturing partner Doosan as it works to build up an orderbook.

The U.S. Department of Energy has provided more than $575 million in support of the design and licensing of NuScale’s SMR plant.

Small modular reactors are expected to play a key role in the nation’s nuclear resurgence as the Trump Administration works to unleash more affordable, reliable and secure American energy for U.S. taxpayers.

(NASDAQ: EOSE) (“Eos” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of its offering of $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.75% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on June 3, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Eos also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes.

The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Eos and will accrue interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2025. The notes will mature on June 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before March 15, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after March 15, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Eos will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Eos’s election. The initial conversion rate is 196.0784 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.10 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 27.5% over the public offering price in the concurrent common stock offering described below. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Eos’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 20, 2028 and on or before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Eos’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Eos to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to (x) 110% (or, if the effective date of such fundamental change is on or after June 15, 2027, 105%) of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus (y) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.

Eos estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of notes will be $216,000,000 (or $240,000,000 if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions. Eos intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock referred to below, if it is consummated, (i) to repurchase the full $126 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 5%/6% Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Note due 2026 in a privately negotiated transaction for approximately $131 million; (ii) to prepay $50 million of outstanding borrowings due under its credit agreement, dated June 21, 2024, by and between Eos and CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP (the “Credit Agreement”); and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Upon the prepayment of $50 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the PIK interest rate under the Credit Agreement will decrease from 15% to 7% and the financial covenants thereunder will be waived until 2027. CCM Denali Equity Holdings, LP has agreed that upon the consummation of the offering it will not transfer any securities issued to it under the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 21, 2024, between the Company and CCM Denali Equity Holdings, LP prior to June 21, 2026.

In a separate press release, Eos also announced today the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 18,750,000 shares of its common stock, plus up to an additional 2,812,500 shares of its common stock that the underwriters of the common stock offering have the option to purchase from Eos, at a public offering price of $4.00 per share. The issuance and sale of the common stock are scheduled to settle on June 2, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The completion of the offering of the notes is not contingent on the completion of the offering of common stock, and the completion of the offering of common stock is not contingent on the completion of the offering of the notes. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any common stock in the public offering.

The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws.

After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.

Of the 24 awards cancelled, nearly 70% (16 of the 24 projects) were signed between Election Day and January 20th. The projects primarily include funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. By terminating these awards, DOE is generating an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said Secretary Wright. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

Earlier this month, DOE issued a Secretarial Memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” which outlined DOE’s policy for evaluating financial assistance on a case-by-case basis to identity waste of taxpayer dollars, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s commitment to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people. DOE utilized this review process to evaluate each of these 24 awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment.

Broadcast version by Terri Dee for Illinois News Connection reporting for the Canary Media-Resource Rural-Public News Service Collaboration

A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable's life.

It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the ""Decatur Seven"" drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.

Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support ""from around the world,"" but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He's already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

""By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,"" Honorable said. ""I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I'll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what's going on with this clean energy thing.""

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.

Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois' 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Decatur's hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That's thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.

""The pieces are all coming together,"" Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. ""What makes this region unique is that it's not just about one company or one product line. It's about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won't just be on the coasts - it's being built right here in the Midwest.""

The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.

""So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,"" said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.

Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers - from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.

""We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there's a lot of excitement in the city,"" Carson said. ""That's magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.""

Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce

Richland Community College's clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

""Being called the N-word, couldn't that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,"" said Carson. ""We really dive deep into what's motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.""

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students - for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.

Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.

Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.

He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn't easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.

Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.

""After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,"" James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.

James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.

""As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,"" said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.

""I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,"" James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.

How Illinois' energy policy prioritizes equity

Illinois' 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state's clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.

FEJA's rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn't help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and remedied snafus in the original law.

Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that oversaw FEJA job training and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.

""They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,"" Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups ""are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they're overburdened because of the large lift.""

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as ""navigators,"" using the trust and credibility they've developed in communities to recruit trainees.

Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub's navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.

""The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,"" said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. ""The navigator is saying, 'Hey, I've connected with this portion of the population that's been overlooked or underserved.' OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I'll get them interviewed. We're seeing a real pipeline into careers.""

The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students - for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.

""If you need some help, they always there for you,"" James said.

What's next for Decatur and its clean energy trainees?

In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are much more elaborate and sensitive than those for internal combustion engines.

In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the groundbreaking of an Electric Vehicle Innovation Hub, which will include a climatic research facility - basically a high-tech wind tunnel where companies and researchers from across the world can send EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.

A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive from the state are funding the wind tunnel and the new facilities where Richland classes will be held. In 2022, Pritzker announced these investments as furthering the state goal of 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.

Far from the gritty industrial environs that likely characterized Decatur workplaces of the past, the classrooms at TCCI feature colorful decor, comfortable armchairs, and bright, airy spaces adjacent to pristine high-tech manufacturing floors lined with machines.

""This hub is a game changer,"" said Keiser, noting the need for trained tradespeople. ""As a country, we place a lot of emphasis on kids going to college, and maybe we've kind of overlooked getting tangible skills in the hands of folks.""

A marketing firm founded by Kara Demirjian - Richard Demirjian's sister - and located on-site with TCCI also received clean energy hub funds to promote the training program. This has been crucial to the hub's success, according to Ariana Bennick, account executive at the firm, DCC Marketing. Its team has developed, tested, and deployed digital billboards, mailers, ads, Facebook events, and other approaches to attract trainees and business partners.

""Being a part of something here in Decatur that's really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,"" Bennick said. ""It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.""

With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he'll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he's learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.

""A little at a time - I'm going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I'm passionate about, and then see what's next,"" Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series ""The Flintstones,"" in which the characters' leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: ""Like Fred and Barney, I'll be up and running.""

Recently passed by the House, the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ aims to eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits introduced under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Many of these credits were designed to build a domestic EV supply chain and encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, billions of dollars in private investments were funneled into EV manufacturing in the U.S. The Electrification Coalition reports major investments in states like North Carolina ($25.4 billion), Georgia ($24.5 billion), and Tennessee ($12.4 billion), all designed to jumpstart the transition to electric mobility.

The New Bill’s Impact on EV and Battery Manufacturing

If the new bill passes, it will not only phase out the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, but it will also cut off the manufacturer credit for battery producers after 2031. The bill also comes with stricter rules that limit the use of Chinese components and materials in U.S. manufacturing.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”

Ford’s Michigan battery plant is also tied to a licensing agreement with CATL, a Chinese battery maker. While Ford holds full control over the manufacturing process, production, and workforce, it’s tapping into CATL’s expertise to help with factory equipment installation and to provide critical battery technology know-how.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2024-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Bronze_09-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:23.186676

The U.S. EV market, in particular, is experiencing a slowdown, with EV sales now constituting 9.9% of new car sales, a marginal increase from the previous year’s 9.6%, and a notable deceleration from the 2.9 percentage point growth observed from 2023 to 2024.
Despite this, Bernstein forecasts a continued growth in EV sales, projecting that by 2030, 25% of new car sales will be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 11% will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

The U.S. EV market, in particular, is experiencing a slowdown, with EV sales now constituting 9.9% of new car sales, a marginal increase from the previous year’s 9.6%, and a notable deceleration from the 2.9 percentage point growth observed from 2023 to 2024. This market uncertainty is reflected in the automotive sector’s volatility, with InvestingPro data showing major players like Ford maintaining significant market presence with $182.87 billion in revenue despite challenging conditions. Despite this, Bernstein forecasts a continued growth in EV sales, projecting that by 2030, 25% of new car sales will be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 11% will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

The analysts emphasized the need for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and investors to prioritize flexibility, as the initial phase of easy EV growth—characterized by policy support, premium pricing, and supply constraints—is coming to an end. The next phase is expected to be more capital-intensive and politically volatile, requiring OEMs to have flexible architectures, cost discipline, and regulatory agility to navigate the expanding mainstream market successfully.

Stellantis (NYSE: ) is identified by Bernstein as the best-positioned OEM in the face of the U.S. EV market’s slowdown, thanks to its new multi-technology platform and its exposure to the faster-growing European EV market. This strategic positioning is anticipated to help Stellantis maintain better returns on EV investments compared to its Detroit counterparts.

In contrast, Ford has taken cautious steps by delaying and canceling some of its EV projects while it develops a new EV platform expected to launch in 2027 or later. Bernstein notes that Ford’s transparent reporting structure reveals the company’s Model e EV business unit will continue to incur billions in losses, with significant volume growth needed to achieve profitability in the coming years. According to InvestingPro analysis, Ford currently trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 8.09 and offers a substantial 7.34% dividend yield, though its gross profit margins remain challenged at 8.07%. For deeper insights into Ford’s valuation and 12+ additional ProTips, including detailed financial health scores and Fair Value estimates, investors can access the comprehensive Pro Research Report available on InvestingPro.

General Motors (NYSE: ), meanwhile, has reduced its planned investments in battery manufacturing, reflecting a more conservative approach. While this results in slower EV volume growth and delayed profitability, General Motors is perceived to be avoiding impulsive decisions and focusing on a long-term strategy with its Ultium platform. With Ford’s market capitalization currently at $40.64 billion and analysts forecasting a sales decline this year, the automotive industry’s transformation continues to present both challenges and opportunities for established manufacturers.

In other recent news, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: ) announced a recall of nearly 1.1 million vehicles in the United States due to a software issue affecting rearview cameras. This precautionary measure impacts various models from 2021 to 2024, including the Bronco and F-150, to mitigate potential accident risks. Meanwhile, Bernstein has increased its price target for Ford stock to $8.30, although it maintains an Underperform rating, citing potential market challenges later in 2025 despite a strong first half. In a leadership update, Ford appointed Kyle Crockett as the new Chief Accounting Officer, effective after the second quarter financial report, succeeding Mark Kosman. Crockett’s extensive experience is expected to enhance Ford’s financial operations. Additionally, Ford’s production facilities in Cologne, Germany, are facing potential disruptions due to a planned strike, with further details yet to be disclosed. In response to recent U.S. tariffs, Ford has raised prices on models produced in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E, Maverick, and Bronco Sport, with increases up to $2,000.

The announcement took place at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo. Toyota will supply its hydrogen-powered fuel cell modules for Rehlko’s stationary power generators.

The agreement combines Rehlko’s energy solution experience with Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell technology.

“Toyota is excited to work with Rehlko on helping to build strong energy solutions using our proven, scalable fuel cell technology,” said Thibaut de Barros Conti, general manager, Toyota Hydrogen Solutions. “Integrating Rehlko’s systems with Toyota’s fuel cell technology has the potential to yield cleaner, reliable and more sustainable energy. It can scale based on the needs of customers and society and enable smart, energy-independent mobility for all.”

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Generators for Commercial Use

Interest in hydrogen fuel cell generators continues to grow for stationary power. Rehlko will integrate Toyota’s fuel cell systems into generators that match conventional standards.

These generators will power critical facilities such as data centers and warehouses. They help shield operations from harsh weather and grid failures by producing only water and air as emissions.

“The 1MW fuel cell generator represents a significant step forward in energy resilience for mission-critical customers. It delivers the same reliability, but helps customers meet their resilience goals by cutting local emissions to zero,” said Charles Hunsucker, President, Power Systems at Rehlko. “This technology is ready for orders today.”

Proven Projects Lay the Foundation

Rehlko and Toyota first collaborated on a 100kW hydrogen fuel cell generator at Klickitat Valley Health in Washington. After proving the concept, the companies built a commercial 1MW system. Rehlko led the development while Toyota supplied the core fuel cell technology.

Toyota has spent more than 30 years advancing hydrogen fuel cell research. The company started with the Toyota Mirai and now scales the technology for broader uses. Toyota tests systems in diverse environments and runs operations in Southern California and Kentucky.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) says it has installed over 6,300 EV charging ports across Northern and Central California. To meet rising demand, the company introduced a new method that speeds up EV fast-charging and battery site connections for PG&E EV charging infrastructure.

PG&E introduced the Flexible Service Connection, or Flex Connect, to let customers with controllable power needs, like EV chargers, connect to the grid without waiting for upgrades. Flex Connect uses PG&E’s cloud-based Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) to coordinate power demand based on available electricity. This technology allows faster integration while PG&E completes long-term upgrades. PG&E developed DERMS with Microsoft and Schneider Electric. The system forecasts power limits daily, helping customers plan ahead.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rehlko-FC-Toyota-1400.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 09:09:19.931393

We need a new kind of support ecosystem that moves at the speed of ideas, the big ideas.
When I launched BAMF Health, the technology we were building didn’t exist.
This is not about BAMF Health.
Anthony Chang, PhD, Founder and CEO of BAMF Health","Michigan has always been a place where impossible ideas become reality. Our state is the birthplace of Ford and GM, Kellogg and Meijer, Acrisure and Rocket Companies, Steelcase and Whirlpool. When they were founded, they weren’t just companies — they were revolutions. Each began with a bold vision and a refusal to back down.

As the founder and CEO of BAMF Health, I draw on that same spirit. Headquartered in Grand Rapids, we are building a platform that is redefining how cancer and other diseases are diagnosed and treated. BAMF stands for Bold Advanced Medical Future — not just a name, but a mindset. One rooted in believing the impossible is not just worth pursuing, it’s our responsibility.

Innovation no longer follows the linear path it did when Ford launched his assembly line. The startup environment is fundamentally different. For entrepreneurs today, it takes the same grit and determination, but true success demands bigger risks and faster speed. We need a new kind of support ecosystem that moves at the speed of ideas, the big ideas. It must start with a paradigm shift in mindset.

When I launched BAMF Health, the technology we were building didn’t exist. The field of medicine we were advancing— theranostics — was almost virtually unknown in the U.S. There was no blueprint. No playbook. No metrics to benchmark. We were navigating uncharted waters, learning as we went, while simultaneously constructing an aircraft carrier. What we needed wasn’t just funding, but belief. We needed people and institutions to understand the true meaning of risk-taking for revolution to happen. That’s the kind of support system we must create in Michigan.

We can no longer rely on outdated evaluation models to judge the value of future-shaping ideas. Innovators pushing into new frontiers — whether it’s biotech, AI, energy, or beyond — won’t look like traditional businesses. They won’t fit familiar molds. But that’s the point. If Michigan wants to lead again, we need to bet on the bold and get rid of nonsense.

We need: Legislators who champion future-focused policy; Educators who build talent pipelines for industries not yet at scale; Engineers who invent what doesn’t yet exist; and investors who fund what isn’t yet certain.

We need people who aren’t afraid to move fast, fail fast, and try again even faster. Because when lives are at stake, “someday” isn’t good enough.

This is not about BAMF Health. It’s about what’s next. We can turn Michigan into the most fertile ground for new ideas in the country, but only if we stop clinging to what’s worked in the past. We must shift from a mindset of protecting certainty to a culture that embraces possibility.

Henry Ford’s first company failed. But failure is part of the process. Today’s disruptors need the freedom to stumble, iterate, and come back faster and stronger.

Michigan has every asset it needs: talent, grit, philanthropy and heart. But now we need courage. Courage to take risks, to move faster, and to build the future before it’s obvious to everyone else. If we succeed, we won’t just change Michigan, we’ll change the world.

Let’s stop waiting for perfect conditions. Let’s bet on the bold — because the future belongs to those who dare to build it.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said.

All submitted comments are included in the Detroit District’s administrative record, analyzed, and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS and other parts of the District’s review, as applicable.

“Even when operating under emergency procedures, the Detroit District remains committed to following the NEPA process,” said Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff.

The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.

The EIS assesses the potential impacts of the Line 5 Tunnel Project and project alternatives (including the No Action alternative, an alternative that would install a protective gravel/rock cover over the existing Dual Pipelines in the Straits, and multiple pipeline decommissioning sub-alternatives, if the proposed tunnel were to be permitted) to land use and recreation; aesthetics; water resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology; soils; transportation and navigation; air quality; noise and vibration; socioeconomics; and reliability and safety.

In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act

The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.

The Record of Decision date is anticipated in fall 2025.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Lt.

A ‘costly attack’ on US renewables Much of the impetus behind these cancellations comes from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut support for renewable energy manufacturing, seen most sharply in the House of Representatives’ passage of a bill that will slash almost all Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits for renewable energy projects.
While the bill needs to pass the Senate, and so is still subject to change, the severity of cuts suggests that the president will do more to undermine the US renewable energy sector than many assumed.
Last year, Wood Mackenzie said that it would be “unlikely” a second Trump presidency would significantly undermine federal support for renewable energy projects, such as the IRA.
The analyst argued that many Republican states have benefited from IRA policies, which have helped create new jobs and secure US energy independence, regardless of individual politicians’ scepticism regarding the value of renewable energy power.","There is a clear relationship between the cancellation of projects and Trump taking office in January, with the 21 projects scrapped in just the first four months of this year already more than the 15 projects cancelled in the whole of 2024. This trend is shown in the graph below.

While this has not led to a complete withdrawal of investment in new clean energy projects – E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker report that businesses announced nearly US$500 million in new solar, electric vehicle (EV) and grid facilities in April alone – their figures suggest that more investment has been cancelled thus far in 2025 than announced in new projects. Indeed, 2025 is on pace for around US$42 billion in cancelled investment, a figure that would be more than double the total investment announced for the clean energy sector in 2024.

The majority of these project cancellations have been in the storage and EV sectors, with E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker reporting that investors in these industries have scrapped US$10.3 billion and US$6.3 billion of investment so far this year, respectively.

This is not entirely surprising as these sectors have seen the most total investment announced – US$42.2 billion in storage and US$82.4 billion in EVs – but the proportion of cancelled funding as a percentage of new funding announced is striking; project cancellations in the storage sector are valued at around one-quarter of the new funding announced this year, the second-largest proportion behind only the wind sector. These trends are shown in the graph above.

The solar industry, meanwhile, has emerged relatively unscathed so far this year. Its lost investments of US$2.9 billion are smaller than similar cancellations in the wind, storage and EV sectors, and only one solar project has been scrapped so far this year, fewer than any other technology type, including green hydrogen. Indeed, just six solar projects have been cancelled since 2023, according to data tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, compared to six wind projects, 13 storage projects and 16 EV projects. This trend is shown in the graph below.

Indeed, the only solar generation project to be consolidated in 2025 is the Ivanpah facility near the Nevada-California border, a 392MW concentrated solar plant that will slash its capacity by two-thirds and transition to solar PV generation.

The other five cancellations have been in the manufacturing sector, and include Meyer Burger’s abandonment of module production in Arizona, which was announced earlier today, and REC Silicon’s termination of polysilicon in Washington following a failed purity test last December.

A ‘costly attack’ on US renewables

Much of the impetus behind these cancellations comes from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut support for renewable energy manufacturing, seen most sharply in the House of Representatives’ passage of a bill that will slash almost all Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits for renewable energy projects. While the bill needs to pass the Senate, and so is still subject to change, the severity of cuts suggests that the president will do more to undermine the US renewable energy sector than many assumed.

Last year, Wood Mackenzie said that it would be “unlikely” a second Trump presidency would significantly undermine federal support for renewable energy projects, such as the IRA. The analyst argued that many Republican states have benefited from IRA policies, which have helped create new jobs and secure US energy independence, regardless of individual politicians’ scepticism regarding the value of renewable energy power.

The E2 and Clean Economy Tracker figures show that the majority of cuts will affect Republican-led regions, with Republican districts losing more than US$12 billion in investment and over 13,000 jobs that were once announced.

Indeed, through April 2025, 61% of all clean energy projects announced, 72% of all new jobs created and 82% of total investments were made into districts represented by Republicans, suggesting that Trump considers regions governed by members of his own party acceptable collateral damage as he looks to cut support for renewable power.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on US manufacturing and jobs,” said Michal Timberlake, E2 communications director. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

There is also confusion regarding the impacts of the latest bill, with Mike Carr, head of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition telling PV Tech Premium last week that there may well be “unintended consequences on the manufacturing and deployment side.” Considering the scale of renewable energy investments already announced, even the slightest element of uncertainty seems to have been enough to encourage investors to pull the plug on their projects.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/meyer-burger.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:51.672267

But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies.","A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available. Chevron didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, Ted Boutrous, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said under the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Republicans, new data studies from NERA Economic Consulting shows that repealing the clean energy tax credits could cause New York to lose up to 20,300 jobs as clean energy projects are canceled or scaled back due to lack of incentive, with a nearly $3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP and New Yorkers paying up to $650 in higher energy costs each year by 2032 if these cuts become law.

The Senate still needs to pass the bill before it would go on to President Trump for signature.

Schumer said the tax cut bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have gone to the buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

Eliminates the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit that supports American-made clean hydrogen, led by New York companies like Plug Power and Air Products, to be used for clean manufacturing and agriculture.

The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives have spurred over $5 billion worth of investments in clean manufacturing in New York, creating over 7,200 jobs. Schumer said if this House plan goes through, many of the clean energy projects spurred by the IRA could be forced to scale back or even stop and the workers laid off, and projects that otherwise would have come online will never come to fruition.

Notably, the IRA allows firms to develop and sell energy tax credits, as outlined here, to advance its goals of reducing emissions while also boosting domestic manufacturing and innovation.

In our last update, available here, we discussed how Trump's withdrawal from global climate agreements and open disdain for the ""Green New Deal"" signaled a deliberate shift away from clean energy, making a reversal of the IRA seem inevitable.

That reversal is now underway. As many feared, the House advanced its budget on May 22 summarized here, which would significantly pare back the IRA's clean energy initiatives to help offset the cost of other items, such as the anticipated extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") provisions.

Released under the banner of ""Working Families Over Elites,"" the bill would eliminate several consumer-facing tax credits, including credits for purchasing electric vehicles, installing charging infrastructure, and making home energy efficiency upgrades. Some limited exceptions would extend the ability to claim a credit through 2026.

The bill would also eliminate the credit for clean hydrogen production, widely viewed as one of the more innovative (if often misunderstood) technologies sanctioned by the IRA.

Most significantly, the bill would gut the technology-neutral investment tax credit (""ITC"") and production tax credit (""PTC"")—two of the cornerstones of the IRA, as we introduced here—by eliminating the credit for projects that have not begun construction within 60 days after the bill's enactment or are not placed in service before the end of 2028 (with an exception for qualifying nuclear facilities). The bill would also disallow the credit for residential wind and solar property that is leased to a third party.

Additionally, the bill would eliminate the ability to sell the clean fuel production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2027, the latter of which was on track to become one of the most widely claimed credits under the IRA. The bill would also eliminate transferability for the carbon sequestration credit two years after its enactment, along with the investment credit for certain energy property.

Although the IRA tax credits were structured as 10-year incentives set to expire after 2032, with some credits subject to phase-outs, the bill would shorten that timeline by terminating the nuclear power production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2031. It's possible that future revisions could further accelerate the phase-out of these credits, as proposed in the initial House draft.

Beyond these timing restrictions, the bill would impose ""foreign entity of concern"" limitations across several provisions—which we anticipated here—amid growing concerns over China's dominance in critical supply chains like solar panels, batteries and critical minerals.

But even as those restrictions gain political traction, the popularity of the credits has prompted a more cautious tone from some policymakers. Earlier in May, a group of House Republicans wrote a letter urging their colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee to preserve the IRA credits, citing both the need to position the U.S. as a global energy leader and concerns over rising energy costs. That warning, however, may have fallen on deaf ears.

The Tax Foundation estimates here that fully repealing the IRA's clean energy incentives would raise $851 billion. By contrast, the scaled-back proposal currently on the table would raise only about a third of that amount—leading some Republicans to argue that it doesn't go far enough.

Uncertainty persists, but as the IRA approaches its third anniversary, one thing is clear: the market for credit transfers is huge, with market analysts estimating that total volume exceeded $24 billion in 2024.

We will continue to monitor developments and provide updates in Brass Tax as the landscape continues to evolve.

The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law.
The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

But power plants, as the largest source of several harmful pollutants, are responsible for 50 percent of the emissions, more than 50 percent of acid gas emissions and about 25 percent of toxic metal emissions in the U.S. As for mercury, coal-fired power plants emit 99 percent of it and most of the other power-sector pollutants, the federal agency said.
Although dozens already meet at least some part of the proposed standards, 44 percent of the coal plants lack the advanced pollution-control equipment that these limits require.
“The updated standards will provide certainty and level the playing field so that all power plants will have to limit their toxic emissions,” the EPA said.
Coal-fired power plants are scattered on Native lands all across the U.S.","The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday issued the first-ever U.S. regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, a move that officials said would reduce 91 percent of the mercury in coal from being released into the air, improving public health.

“Today we’re taking an important step forward in EPA’s efforts to safeguard the health of millions of Americans,” EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said at a press conference to sign the new order, according to CNN. “Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution technologies to control and cut harmful emissions like mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases.”

The new rules will apply to all 1,350 of the country’s coal and oil-fired units that are in 525 power plants. These emit harmful pollutants that include mercury, arsenic, other toxic metals, acid gases and organic air toxics such as dioxin, the EPA said in summarizing the plan.

Two of the three industry sectors that contribute the bulk of mercury pollution—medical waste incinerators and municipal waste combustors—have already reduced their emissions by more than 95 percent, the EPA said. But power plants, as the largest source of several harmful pollutants, are responsible for 50 percent of the emissions, more than 50 percent of acid gas emissions and about 25 percent of toxic metal emissions in the U.S.

As for mercury, coal-fired power plants emit 99 percent of it and most of the other power-sector pollutants, the federal agency said.

“The updated standards will provide certainty and level the playing field so that all power plants will have to limit their toxic emissions,” the EPA said. Facilities have up to four years to meet the standards.

Coal-fired power plants are scattered on Native lands all across the U.S. The Navajo Nation has three, including the Navajo Generating Station, which according to the Grand Canyon Trust produces about a fifth of Arizona’s greenhouse gases, as well as being a major source of mercury and nitrogen pollution.

It’s too early to know if Trump’s plans will mean more energy projects get completed.","Brandon Tuck got a lot of calls when President Donald Trump began his drive to “unleash” American energy this year.

The Houston lawyer guides construction on big projects like pipelines. Clients rejoiced that “the seas had parted” after Trump’s barrage of executive orders and declaration of an energy emergency. But the waters, he would tell them, were still pretty treacherous.

“It’s a trap for the unwary,” Tuck said in an interview. “You might have your permit in six months if you use that emergency authority, but you might lose it in a year or two.”

That emergency authority is one in a suite of tools Trump has offered to fossil fuel companies to get permits faster and, therefore, build faster. But Tuck and others like him are warning that those tools can’t speed up projects as much as backers might hope.

In fact, Trump’s moves could backfire, leaving projects tied up in court for years.

People who shepherd big energy projects say shortcutting reviews, firing bureaucrats and demolishing well-established processes is not the way to make such problems go away. Reviews done too quickly can invite errors that opponents seize on in court. Permit backlogs can grow when regulatory agencies are short-staffed. And blowing up longstanding practices can leave developers without landmarks to navigate.

The reality is that, for now, not much in the U.S. government has changed outside of Trump’s executive branch.

Congress hasn’t repealed the environmental laws that guide permitting and set the parameters for environmental analysis. Lawmakers are weighing changes to pipeline permitting and the National Environmental Policy Act in the Republicans’ party-line “megabill,” but weeks of legislative haggling remain, if not more. A Thursday ruling by the Supreme Court limited the scope of environmental reviews. But agencies will still be required to thoroughly examine the direct effects of energy projects.

For now, judges are mostly working with the same statutes and case law they’ve used for decades when they consider environmental challenges to major projects.

“I wish I could point to something that the federal administration has done to speed up permitting,” said Jennifer Jeffers, who guides projects for clients of the Allen Matkins law firm in San Francisco, in an email exchange. “But so far most, if not all, of the administration’s efforts on the environmental front have been to dismantle agencies and eliminate federal jurisdictional oversight.“

Even if it is intended to speed up permitting, she said, that dismantling and eliminating will likely lead to delays, uncertainty and increased costs for developers.

But some experts who work with the fossil fuel industry aren’t worried about unintended consequences.

Jason Hill, a partner with the Holland & Knight law firm in Houston who served at the Interior Department in Trump’s first term, says he doesn’t expect the current administration to cut back on scientific analysis of projects. Instead, he said, it will light a fire under regulatory officials in Washington to make decisions.

That’s what they did in Trump’s first term, Hill said, to great effect.

“I haven’t seen any indication from my interactions with the government that they’re doing things any different or any less rigorous than they always have,” Hill said.

And even if they do complicate projects at first, Trump’s actions will improve permitting in the long run, said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative Institute for Energy Research think tank. But that’s not enough. To make permanent changes, he said, Congress needs to improve the process.

“It all points back to permitting,” he said.

The American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas trade association, offered similar sentiments, saying in an emailed statement that “durable reform” is needed for the federal permitting system.

But it’s far from clear what will reach Trump’s desk. The Senate is still working on its version. It’s not certain that the full Senate will agree to those provisions. Senators might not even be allowed to because, to avoid the Senate filibuster, all elements of the bill are expected to relate to budget matters.

Trump campaigned on a promise to drill more for oil and gas, though under former President Joe Biden, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever had. Hours after Trump was sworn in in January, he declared an “energy emergency” designed to bulldoze barriers to energy production, transportation and export.

The reason for that “emergency,” Trump said, was Biden — his administration’s approach to energy and his push to reduce the effects of climate change. But Biden’s administration had also claimed credit for getting environmental reviews done 23 percent faster than during Trump’s first term.

Oil industry leaders scoff at the idea that Biden improved federal process for permitting big projects.

“We certainly know that all the efforts prior to President Trump have not fixed the problem,” said John Stoody, a vice president with the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association. “So we appreciate whatever his administration can do to fix the broken permitting process.”

‘Twist of irony’

Since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, Trump and his appointees have cut a path of disruption through the conventional understanding of how energy and environmental policy works.

They revoked White House Council on Environmental Quality rules that have guided agencies and developers for decades. Then they directed permitting agencies to use their emergency powers to bypass environmental rules.

Tens of thousands of federal employees have departed because of Trump’s campaign, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to shrink the size of the federal workforce through retirements, incentives and mass layoffs. Musk this week announced he’ll soon end his work with the Department of Government Efficiency initiative he helped to launch and lead.

Among the high-profile moves to speed up projects: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s plan to cut environmental reviews of fossil fuel and mining projects from years down to no more than a month.

Taken together, those policies are probably the biggest offensive against environmental regulations since the laws they implement were written in the 1960s and 1970s. But whether the moves will truly unleash energy projects is unclear because the onslaught has left risk and uncertainty in its wake.

“In a twist of irony,” Jeffers’ firm said in an online post, Trump’s revocation of NEPA regulations, “could lead to greater delays in environmental reviews and permitting” for fossil fuel and mining projects, “at least in the near term.”

Trump administration officials’ push for agencies to use emergency authorities to speed projects will likely draw court challenges, Tuck said, because laws and regulations generally have very narrow criteria for what qualifies as an emergency.

“Our very consistent response is: ‘Be wary of anything they offer to shortcut,’” said Tuck, a partner at Vinson & Elkins.

Opponents of the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley gas pipelines accused agencies of taking such shortcuts to speed approval of the projects. They got a sympathetic ear from federal appeals court judges. Atlantic Coast got canceled after years of delays. The Mountain Valley gas pipeline finished more than five years late and billions of dollars over budget, and only after Congress and Biden rescued it.

Interior’s plan to shrink the time for environmental assessments (EA) to 14 days and environmental impact statements to 28 days, was “much more aggressive than anything I anticipated,” said Hill, the Interior Department veteran. He’s watching for details.

“It’s one thing to say you’re going to do an EA in 14 days,” he said. “It’s another thing to say how you’re going to do that, and I don’t think that granular level of detail has been provided.”

Tuck said he expects the overhaul to change the order in which tasks are done, not make the process 10 times faster. Developers will need to spend more time and money before applying for an EA or environmental impact statement (EIS) to ensure they’ve provided everything regulatory agencies will need. Only after that can they expect such a quick decision.

“Nobody’s writing an EIS in 28 days. That’s fanciful,” Tuck said. “What they’re saying is, you give us all the information, all the analysis, and we’ll review it and process it posthaste. But how long does it take clients to develop that information? Oh, you know, many, many months — a year, a year and a half, two years.”

The purges of Trump and Musk have been promoted as a way to save money. But energy experts say they could wind up costing project developers a lot of time. The aggressive approach Trump and Musk used to thin the ranks may also have hit the people who could move projects along.

When CEO Amy Andryszak of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America presented a list of changes to laws that could speed interstate gas pipeline projects to a House subcommittee last month, she didn’t mention Musk’s chainsaw approach or the Trump administration’s “Reduction in Force” push. But she did add that “adequate staffing and expertise across federal agencies” was also important.

“If we are going to build the infrastructure necessary to meet growing energy demand and the administration’s goals of American energy dominance,” she said in a statement emailed to POLITICO’s E&E News, “we need agencies with the resources and personnel necessary to ensure the certification and development of the aforementioned infrastructure.”

Hill said he’s confident the administration has been careful to keep the federal employees needed to keep the permits flowing.

But federal employees can do more than just process permits. Agencies can sometimes actively help move projects through the process. But they can’t if they don’t have enough staff.

As an example, Tuck said the Army Corps of Engineers has long done wetland delineations, for landowners, showing which parts of their property can be developed without Clean Water Act concerns. At one point, the agency was able to perform them even for those not seeking permits.

But even before Musk opened the throttle on his chainsaw, Tuck said, the Army Corps was cutting back. With the mass exodus from federal offices, he expects the agency will be able to do even fewer.

It’s too early to know if Trump’s plans will mean more energy projects get completed. But at least one big energy project has been slowed by the Trump administration itself.

Empire Wind 1, a New York wind energy project, was stalled by the Trump administration in April, though it had all its permits and construction had started. Trump recently relented and allowed work to resume. That has fueled speculation that, in return, Trump expects to get the Constitution natural gas pipeline built through New York. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said there is no such “deal.” The developer of that project, Williams Cos., announced Thursday it is reviving the project and another pipeline planned for the Northeast.

The saga illustrates the danger to developers from shifting political priorities.

Such moves have happened in other administrations. One of Biden’s first actions was to cancel the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was designed to move Canadian oil into the United States. Former president Barack Obama put the Dakota Access pipeline on ice when protests heated up in North Dakota. The project was rescued by Trump and now moves oil from the Bakken play to the Midwest.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d1/00/26b3ef274e3eb1f17c40dc6a4381/ew-0517-farah-pipelines-1160-01.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:52.067774

Unprecedented action States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming — somewhat unsuccessfully.
The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon.","(AP) – In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother’s fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car’s air conditioning wasn’t working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company. ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday’s filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.”

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.”

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming — somewhat unsuccessfully. Hawaii and Michigan, for example, recently announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, and they have been met by a counter lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department.

The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, again; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change; and the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company’s greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”",https://www.kxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/climate-change-e1665089100819.jpg?icb=1748613367,N,,2025-05-30 10:03:59.793386

Meanwhile, the lab’s federal employees — like other EPA employees throughout the agency — have been given the option to retire early, leave voluntarily or apply for a limited number of jobs at other divisions within the agency.

More than two months after the Trump administration’s plans to cut the EPA’s Office of Research and Development were first reported by the New York Times, uncertainty still swirls around the future of EPA’s Great Lakes Toxicology and Ecology Division Laboratory, 6201 Congdon Blvd., which is part of ORD.

A portion of the reduction plan, shared earlier this year with the News Tribune by Science Committee Democratic staff, said the EPA planned to “eliminate” the ORD and expected 50%-75% of its more than 1,540 positions ""will not be retained.""

Earlier this month, the Trump administration submitted its budget to Congress, which called for a $235 million, or 45%, cut in ORD’s budget.

According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, and a recording of a May 2 virtual meeting obtained by the News Tribune, EPA officials told ORD employees that they could apply to approximately 500 job openings at other offices within the EPA.

Job applications for the new positions and decisions on early retirement or the so-called deferred resignation program were all due a week later, on May 9.

Questions about relocation for the new jobs, however, linger. While one official said the 130 new jobs within the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention would not require relocation and gave Duluth as an example of a place the staffer could remain, a slide showing the organization the newly created Office of Applied Sciences and Environmental Solutions, which account for 300 of the new jobs, only listed locations in Oklahoma, Ohio, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.

Officials said another 30-50 positions would be available at the Office of Air and Radiation and told staff at ORD they could also apply for new positions in the Office of Water.

Questions on the future of ORD were often answered by officials who said the latest plans didn’t directly affect ORD and that more reorganization plans were coming.

Less than a week later, as the May 9 deadline loomed, ORD staff were told, “If you’re interested in remaining with the Agency, we encourage you to apply for any and all of the positions you may be qualified for,” according to an email reviewed by the News Tribune.

However, any mass layoffs appear to be on hold after a federal judge earlier this month blocked the Trump administration from large-scale reductions in force or agency reorganizations of federal agencies, including the EPA, “without partnering with Congress.”

Even so, the lab’s workforce has dropped by about 25 over the last month when a grant was cut and a contract left to expire, both of which allowed early-career researchers to work alongside EPA scientists at the lab. Prior to that, there were 176 employees at the lab, 68 of whom were federal scientists, and the remaining 108 were post-doctoral researchers, student contractors and facility staff, according to an EPA fact sheet updated in April.

It’s unclear how many employees took an early retirement or deferred resignation.

In response to the News Tribune’s request for an interview on what the agency’s reorganization effort and cancellation of the grant and contract meant for the future of the Duluth lab, an EPA spokesperson responded with a brief statement.

“At ORD (Office of Research and Development) and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing to invest in research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” a spokesperson for the EPA said.

A five-year National Student Services Contract between the EPA and Oak Ridge Associated Universities that allowed earlier career researchers to work alongside EPA scientists at seven ORD labs and offices, including Duluth, expired May 14 and a new contract was not approved.

ORAU did not respond to the News Tribune’s request for comment. Multiple sources estimated that approximately 20 researchers, ranging from undergraduates to postdocs, at the Duluth Lab were let go when the contract expired. On its website, ORAU has removed employee spotlight pages that once highlighted the work of its researchers working with the EPA. It also replaced a page of contract information with a thank-you message.

“ORAU would like to thank EPA for 10 years of successful partnership managing the National Student Services Contract (NSSC),” the website said this week. “We would also like to thank all of our employees who worked side by side with the hardworking federal employees at EPA.“

Last month, the EPA cut a $3.5 million grant that trained undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Minnesota Duluth in chemical risk management and water quality protection.

The grant began in November 2023 and was expected to last five years, but it ended abruptly April 30, with a notice from the EPA stating the grant was terminated immediately because the “objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” a UMD spokesperson said.

More than $800,000 had been obligated when the grant was cut, with almost $300,000 already paid to the university, according to USASpending.gov.

The Department of Government Efficiency, President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s effort to slash federal spending and programming, now lists the cutting of the grant as a savings on its so-called “Wall of Receipts.”

In a statement, Donn Branstrator, professor of biology at UMD, said the school requested “an orderly closeout” so it can continue the contract until next spring.

“Water quality protection is of vital importance for Minnesotans and people across the country, and the EPA and UMD scientists have a long and productive track record of collaboration in research and student training,” Branstrator said. “Without this funding, the region and the nation will lose out on the training and career development of current and future scientists committed to protecting the environment.”

A UMD spokesperson said one postdoctoral investigator and four graduate students from UMD were in training when the grant was cut, and another two graduate students were expected to begin in the fall. The grant cut affects an additional 15 undergraduate students, seven graduate students and three postdoctoral investigators who would have been trained in aquatic toxicology and ecology.

A letter sent in April by U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, both Democrats from Minnesota, to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding answers about the future of the Duluth lab has not been answered by the agency, Smith’s office said. The two sent a follow-up letter to Zeldin urging him to respond to their earlier letter and confirm the EPA would not attempt to reduce staff at the Duluth lab while the court's injunction on large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations is in effect.

In a statement Thursday, Smith said the lab in Duluth and its work on clean and safe water were irreplaceable because of its access to Lake Superior.

“I’m extremely concerned that workers at the lab aren’t getting the clarity they deserve about what’s going on. They are being left in the dark, not knowing if their jobs are safe,” Smith said. “The Trump administration needs to listen to the federal court order temporarily halting any proposed cuts to the lab, but unfortunately this administration has shown a blatant disregard for rule of law and court orders. I’m disappointed the Trump EPA can’t answer a series of simple questions about the future of the lab and these workers, but I’m not giving up.”

In a separate statement Thursday, Klobuchar echoed the need to keep the Duluth lab open.

“The Duluth lab is critical for the Northland and the Great Lakes in a big way — ensuring safe drinking water and supporting our recreation and shipping economy — which is why I continue to press the administration to keep the lab open,” Klobuchar said.

“While the courts have stepped in to block these across-the-board changes, we must continue to protect our Northland and the Great Lakes,"" she said. ""I support making the government more efficient, but it must be done in a way that is based on facts and science, without threatening our economy or putting public health on the line.”

State Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, also wrote a letter to Zeldin in April, but had not received a response as of Tuesday, a spokesperson for his office said.

U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., said he recently met with EPA Region 5 Administrator Anne Vogel.

“Congressman Stauber did express his desire for the Duluth Research Lab to remain open due to the important research they perform around the Great Lakes,"" a spokesperson for the Hermantown lawmaker's office said Thursday. ""There is no new update on the status of this lab, and Regional Administrator Vogel relayed to the congressman that this decision ultimately remains with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.""",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/2e92651/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1598x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F90%2F2a%2Fe94eedde4722a209625660be9224%2Fepa-c09.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:14:28.252921

Many people were shocked when Elon Musk decided to back Donald Trump and the Republican Party, considering they have consistently attacked clean energy and electric vehicles, which are Tesla’s main products.

The GOP has been undermining renewable energy for years, and it doesn’t look like Musk’s $300 million donation to Trump and influence on the GOP were able to change that, as the latest budget to pass the GOP controlled-Congress undoes a lot of progress made by the Biden administration on clean energy and electric vehicle adoption.

The budget removes the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which is a big part of Tesla’s success in the US. It also kills incentives to build batteries in the US – another incentive that greatly benefited Tesla.

It also removes 30% tax credit on battery storage and solar, which greatly helped Tesla’s energy division.

Yesterday, Tesla issued a statement calling for the Trump government to gradually phase out those incentives rather than removing them altogether:

Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.

Musk shared the statement and then added that while the government that he helped elect is removing incentives for electric vehicles and clean energy, it is not removing those for oil and gas:

The US is incentivizing the oil and gas industry at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars per year.

Before backing Trump and the Republican Party, Musk had stated that he would be for the removal of EV and clean energy incentives if incentives for fossil fuels were also removed.

Musk has officially exited the Trump administration this week.

Electrek’s Take

It’s interesting to see Musk finally speaking out, albeit weakly, against some of Trump’s policies for the first time. He did note that the budget bill would increase the deficit, and now this.

A quick reminder that Musk said that Trump was the “only one who could save the Western world” and that if he is not elected, the US is basically done.

His stated goals with Trump were to “kill the woke mind virus” and get the deficit and debt under control.

The US has never been more divided, and Trump is pushing a budget that would add about $4 trillion to the US debt over the next few years. His backing of Trump hasn’t achieved anything meaningful toward those goals. Of course, Musk’s real goal in backing Trump was likely to get federal regulators and agencies that were closing in on him and his businesses off his back.

He was successful in doing that, but at what cost?

The EV tax credit is a significant factor in maintaining Tesla’s demand in the US, which is essentially its last primary market where it sells vehicles at a profit.

The removal of the 30% ITC for solar and energy storage would significantly slow down Tesla’s energy storage business, which has been its only growing business for the last two years.

In short, the budget would greatly weaken Tesla’s business in the US, which was its last remaining market that wasn’t doing too badly. Canada is gone. Europe is gone, and Tesla is facing tremendous pressure from competition in China.",https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/electrek.png?w=32,N,,2025-05-30 08:01:29.650603

U.S. farmers are calling on the federal government to boost domestic biofuel use as they deal with falling exports and growing crop surpluses due to trade disputes.

Following trade wars, especially with China, many growers have no foreign buyers for their upcoming soybean, corn, and wheat harvests.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to release a new plan on renewable volume obligations (RVOs), which dictate how much biofuel must be blended into traditional fuels.

Farmers and agricultural groups are asking for higher mandates to create new markets and reduce reliance on exports.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” said Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association. “I can store one good crop; I can’t store multiple years.”

Export data shows soybean sales are down 79% and corn sales are 49% below the five-year average. These issues come on top of global grain oversupply, which has already hurt prices. A 2022 grain price peak has since dropped by more than 40%.

Major agribusinesses and farm groups want the EPA to mandate at least 5.25 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and maintain 15 billion gallons of ethanol.

Surprisingly, even the American Petroleum Institute supports this, aligning with farmers to boost biofuel use.

Still, not everyone agrees. Some oil refiners say there’s not enough gasoline sold to support such high ethanol levels and question whether feedstock supply is enough for increased renewable diesel production.

The industry’s concerns are valid. Biodiesel plants are operating at just 51% of their capacity, while renewable diesel facilities are running at 72%. This has impacted farmers’ ability to move their crops.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” said Peter Zonneveld of biofuel firm Neste Oyj.

The EPA confirmed it has sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House for review. The plan supports “President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices.”

With reduced cattle herds and shrinking exports, farmers believe a robust domestic market for biofuels could be key to economic recovery.

They argued that Georgia Power isn’t properly accounting for the chance that data center projects could fall through.
That’s possible largely thanks to the increased revenue Georgia Power is expecting from new, large customers — like data centers.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

Georgia’s largest electric utility is preparing to meet what it says is a huge spike in new electricity demand. Georgia Power says it expects it will need to provide 8,200 more megawatts by 2031 – about four times the energy made by its brand-new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

A key factor driving Georgia Power’s plans is the enormous growth in need the company says it expects over the next few years from large industrial customers — especially data centers.

But some critics argue Georgia Power’s predictions are too high. Energy experts testifying before the Georgia Public Service Commission this week cast doubt on Georgia Power’s prediction of a massive, rapid increase in energy demand — known as load.

“We conclude that the forecast produced by Georgia Power is likely skewed to show load realization sooner and in greater quantity than is likely to materialize,” said Robert Trokey, who leads the electric unit of the Public Service Commission’s staff.

Getting that forecast wrong could have major implications for customer bills and for climate change.

The commission last year approved new natural gas turbines and battery storage that Georgia Power asked for in an emergency request driven largely by expected data center demand.

Now, the commissioners are considering the utility’s new long-term energy plan as part of a regularly-scheduled regulatory proceeding.

The plan calls for keeping coal plants open longer, upgrading nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, adding solar and improving power lines.

Georgia Power made its case to the commission over several days of hearings in March. This week, the commission’s public interest advocacy staff and the intervenors — environmental and consumer advocacy groups, municipal governments, industry groups and large power buyers like MARTA and Walmart — responded with their own expert testimony.

Several of them simply did not buy Georgia Power’s predictions.

“The way the company has treated its load forecast is deeply flawed,” said energy planning consultant Derek Stenclik, who testified on behalf of the Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Natural Resources Defense Council. “I would even call it utility planning malpractice.”

He and other analysts said the currently-booming data center industry is too new to make confident predictions. They argued that Georgia Power isn’t properly accounting for the chance that data center projects could fall through.

To make forecasts for big customers like data centers and factories, Georgia Power experts run projects in various stages of development through mathematical models that predict how likely the projects are to actually open and how much power they’ll need.

But the company uses different calculations for data centers, predicting they’re more likely to come to fruition than other potential customers like factories and warehouses.

The company doesn’t have data to back up that different math, Trokey argued. Others questioned whether Georgia Power’s modeling adequately accounts for canceled projects.

Officials with the utility maintain their modeling is based on real projects, factoring in how far along the data centers are in the development pipeline and whether data center developers have signed a contract to buy energy from Georgia Power. In the earlier hearings in March, company officials said that any cancelled data center projects had so far been quickly replaced by new ones.

During this week’s hearings, commissioners expressed little patience for skepticism from experts and advocates about the company’s forecast for data center-driven demand.

“Obviously the company believes it’s real because they’re putting them under contract,” said Commissioner Tricia Pridemore. “The state of Georgia believes it’s real. Georgia Department of Economic Development has been involved. The Governor’s been involved. Commissioners have been involved. We’ve worked on these projects, in some cases for years.”

Georgia Power’s forecast is critical because it shapes how the utility plans to be able to meet future, predicted demand.

If the company overestimates, Stenclik and others argued, it risks spending too much on the infrastructure to make and deliver extra energy, and regular customers could end up paying for it. If it underestimates, the company contends, energy reliability could be at risk.

Much of the company’s plan to meet its forecast in the near term relies on fossil fuels, which many public commenters opposed because they contribute to climate change. They urged the commission to consider the impacts of climate change before approving any new or extended use of coal or natural gas.

Considering rates later

The power rates that customers pay, though based on the need to pay for construction and other expenses approved in the energy plan under consideration, are not a part of the current hearings before the commission.

Instead, rates are typically decided during a subsequent proceeding called a rate case.

But rates are top of mind for many Georgia Power customers because their bills have increased six times in the last three years: three rate hikes approved in the last rate case in 2022, two to pay for new reactors at Plant Vogtle, and a separate bill increase to cover high natural gas costs.

This year, the utility and commission staff have proposed an agreement that would freeze rates for now, bypassing the regular rate case. That’s possible largely thanks to the increased revenue Georgia Power is expecting from new, large customers — like data centers.

The commission has also taken steps to help ensure data center companies and other large customers pay for their own infrastructure. But witnesses in this week’s hearings questioned whether those measures are sufficient to protect residents and small businesses from extra costs.

Energy analysts for the commission’s staff also said they’re concerned about rates increasing for other reasons, like cleaning up storm damage and complying with environmental regulations. The deal to freeze rates already includes a plan to address the costs of Hurricane Helene next year.

Upcoming elections

Two of the five commissioners who will vote later this year on both Georgia Power’s long-term plan and the proposed rate freeze are up for election in November. Early voting in the primary has already begun.

This week, one candidate in that primary was disqualified for failing to fulfill residency requirements. He has since said he appealed the decision.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2025/01/AP25031833551773-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:54.755522

Developers installed 7.4 GW of new capacity during the quarter, making it the second-strongest first quarter on record for the USA.

Clean power development continues to expand rapidly in Republican-leaning states, where increased domestic manufacturing and energy production have supported nearly 650,000 direct and indirect jobs. These activities contribute around $3.4 billion annually in tax revenue and landowner payments, mainly in rural areas.

Total installed clean power capacity in the USA reached over 320 GW by the end of March 2025. The 115 project phases that came online in the first quarter represent $10 billion in private investment.

Battery storage capacity exceeded 30 GW for the first time, reflecting a 65% year-on-year increase. The quarter added 1,602 MW of new storage—a record for Q1.

The development pipeline grew by 12% compared to Q1 2024 and now stands at 184,418 MW. Storage and wind pipelines saw year-on-year growth of 57% and 24% respectively. If fully realised, these projects would represent \$328 billion in future investment. The pipeline includes projects already permitted or in advanced development but does not reflect an increase in permitting activity.

New additions in Q1 2025 included 4,459 MW of utility-scale solar, 1,602 MW of battery storage and 1,327 MW of land-based wind.

Texas remains the national leader in clean power deployment, with more than 80 GW of total capacity—up 20% since Q1 2024.

The WMO projects that the global average temperature will exceed 1.5°C above preindustrial levels by 2027, a full decade earlier than previously predicted, due to record-breaking heat and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions.

The shift is driven by compounding factors: stronger El Niño events, declining air pollution that had temporarily cooled the planet, and limited progress in reducing fossil fuel dependence despite the rise of renewables.

Scientists warn that sustained warming at this level could trigger irreversible climate tipping points, including the collapse of coral reefs and melting of polar ice, putting new pressure on policymakers to adjust global climate goals.

Key quote:

“There is no way, barring geoengineering, to prevent global temperatures from going over 1.5 degrees.”

— Zeke Hausfather, climate scientist and climate research lead at Stripe

Why this matters:

Passing the 1.5°C mark has serious consequences. At this level of warming, scientists expect more extreme and frequent weather events, including severe heat waves, crop failures, and ecosystem collapses. Coral reefs, already under stress, face near-total extinction. Polar ice loss could accelerate sea-level rise, putting coastal cities and small island nations at risk. Infectious diseases spread more readily in warmer conditions, and heat-related health problems multiply, especially in already vulnerable communities. Although the world agreed to try to limit warming below this threshold in 2015 at COP21 in Paris, fossil fuel emissions have continued largely unabated, and the energy transition remains too slow. The WMO’s new timeline pulls the future into the present, showing that climate change is no longer a distant threat — it’s here now, and speeding up. It will likely reshape global economies, health systems, and geopolitics in unpredictable and dangerous ways.

In short:

The 8-0 ruling curbs how NEPA can be used, limiting environmental reviews to only the immediate effects of projects like rail lines and pipelines.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized that NEPA is procedural, not a weapon to block development, and courts must defer to agencies on what they include in their reviews.

Environmental advocates argue this decision ignores the full chain of climate and health harms — like pollution from oil refining or increased risks to frontline communities.

Key quote:

“Fossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution.”

— Nathaniel Shoaff, senior attorney at the Sierra Club

Why this matters:

The Supreme Court just shrank one of the most important tools the public has to fight environmentally risky projects at a time when fossil fuel projects are expanding. NEPA has long been a way for communities to slow — or at least understand — the consequences of big infrastructure plans. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the rest of the bench are reframing it as a box-checking exercise. This ruling allows agencies to decide what counts as worth reviewing, and courts are told to back off.

In short:

A German appeals court rejected Saúl Luciano Lliuya’s claim that RWE should pay for flood prevention measures near his Peruvian home, citing only a 1% flood risk to his property over 30 years.

The court, however, affirmed that German civil law could allow victims of climate change to hold major emitters accountable, setting a legal precedent for similar suits worldwide.

While RWE claimed the lawsuit was unfounded and outside German jurisdiction, climate advocates see the ruling as a turning point for global corporate climate liability cases.

Key quote:

“For the first time in history, a higher court in Europe has ruled that large emitters can be held responsible for the consequences of their greenhouse gas emissions.”

— Roda Verheyen, lawyer for plaintiff Saúl Luciano Lliuya

Why this matters:

As climate change escalates, courts are emerging as battlegrounds for accountability. Lawsuits like the one filed by Luciano Lliuya reflect the frustration of people whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by floods, fires, droughts, and other climate-related disasters, yet who see little recourse through politics or diplomacy. Though his specific claim failed, the German court’s recognition of potential corporate liability for emissions lays the groundwork for a wave of new climate litigation. Legal systems are starting to catch up with scientific consensus: Emissions don’t respect borders, and neither should responsibility. This is especially important as wealthier nations and corporations disproportionately contribute to global emissions, while the consequences often hit poorer communities hardest.

In short:

A large section of the Birch Glacier broke off above the Lötschental valley, releasing a surge of debris that covered about 90% of Blatten, a village of 300 people that had been evacuated on May 19.

Authorities said one person remains missing after the collapse, which also buried the Lonza riverbed and could lead to dammed water and further hazards.

Emergency services closed access to the valley, while Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed support for the displaced community, promising solidarity.

Key quote:

“An unbelievable amount of material thundered down into the valley.”

— Matthias Ebener, spokesperson for local authorities in the southwestern canton of Valais

Why this matters:

Switzerland’s Alpine villages have long been seen as stable havens, but melting glaciers and destabilized mountain slopes are turning these once-predictable landscapes into zones of mounting risk. Climate change accelerates glacial melt, reducing the ice that once held rocky slopes in place and increasing the chances of sudden collapses. What happened in Blatten is a warning: As permafrost thaws and weather patterns shift, communities built on centuries of tradition may face more frequent and violent geological threats. It’s not only about property loss or emergency response — these disasters also reshape the land and alter water systems, from river flow to potable water supplies.

In short:

A Boston University analysis found 68% of China’s overseas energy investments in 2022–2023 went to solar and wind, up from just 13% between 2000 and 2021.

While new coal plant financing has stopped, earlier investments continue to result in new coal power plants coming online, which could emit as much CO₂ annually as Austria.

China’s shift is partly driven by a need to export surplus renewable technology amid economic challenges and has included a recent $51 billion pledge to support low-carbon energy in Africa.

Key quote:

China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.”

— Xi Jinping, president of China

Why this matters:

The shift in China's overseas energy financing has far-reaching implications for both global carbon emissions and the geopolitics of clean energy. While Beijing's move away from coal-backed infrastructure projects aligns with climate goals, the follow-through on existing fossil fuel investments continues to embed long-term carbon pollution in developing nations. These coal projects, built decades after wealthy nations began cutting back on such infrastructure, risk locking lower-income countries into emissions-intensive economies just as the global push to decarbonize accelerates. Environmental groups remain concerned about how this dual strategy affects vulnerable regions, especially as countries in Africa and Southeast Asia weigh economic growth against environmental health. With the U.S. government retreating from global climate cooperation under the Trump administration, China’s approach may increasingly shape which technologies and environmental practices take hold in emerging markets.

In short:

Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb is pushing to place every resident within a 10-minute walk of a park by 2045, while also targeting net-zero emissions for all buildings by 2050.

Cities including New York, Seattle, Boston, and D.C. are investing in energy-efficient housing, solar incentives, and heat pumps to cut costs and emissions.

As federal climate policy stalls, mayors are leveraging local momentum to improve health, lower living costs, and stimulate regional economies through green jobs.

Key quote:

“We as elected officials have to do a better job of articulating how this important part of public policy is connected to the everyday lived experience.”

— Justin Bibb, mayor of Cleveland

Why this matters:

As federal climate initiatives recede under the Trump administration, cities are stepping up as engines of environmental action, using their nimbleness and proximity to communities to reshape daily life. Urban heat, air pollution, and unaffordable utilities hit low-income residents hardest — often compounding the health impacts of environmental injustice. By making neighborhoods greener and buildings more efficient, mayors aim to ease the cost of living while improving public health for everyone. That’s critical in cities like Cleveland, where asthma, heat vulnerability, and economic inequality collide. Local actions such as planting trees, installing solar panels, and replacing gas stoves with electric alternatives reduce emissions but also clean the air and make homes safer.

These improvements ripple outward: Urban demand for renewables drives rural solar development, while electric school buses made in Appalachian factories get kids to class without belching diesel fumes. As cities absorb the shocks of climate change and federal indifference, the choices mayors make now could shape not just local resilience, but national economic and environmental futures.

In short:

Three Texas Senate-passed bills sought to limit renewable energy by restricting wind and solar development locations, mandating one-to-one gas offsets for new renewables, and requiring backup gas generation for existing projects.

These measures, backed by far-right groups but opposed by much of the Texas business lobby, were subsequently not scheduled for House votes, effectively killing them this session.

Despite the bills’ failure, advocates warn that local opposition and political pressure may continue to threaten renewable energy expansion in Texas.

Why this matters:

Texas leads the nation in wind power and is rapidly expanding its solar footprint, yet it remains a political battleground over the future of energy. The quiet defeat of these bills reflects a growing tension within the Republican party, where local economic gains from clean energy are clashing with ideological opposition to climate-friendly policy. Rural landowners, utilities, and developers stand to gain financially from renewables, while national and state conservative groups push to protect fossil fuels. This internal rift complicates efforts to modernize the grid amid rising electricity demand and climate-related stress. The failure of these bills offers a temporary reprieve, but with organized opposition mobilizing around local discontent and future legislation already in draft form, the fight over Texas’s energy future is far from over.

Remember the banana peels, apple cores and leftover pizza you recently threw in the garbage? Today, your food waste, and your neighbors’, is emitting climate-warming greenhouse gases as it decomposes in a nearby municipal landfill.

Buried food scraps and yard waste at 51 dumps across Colorado generate an amount of methane equivalent to driving 1 million gasoline-powered cars for a year. About 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas over a period of 20 years, methane accounts for 11% of global emissions that scientists say are warming the atmosphere and contributing to more intense and severe weather, wildfires and drought.

Landfills are the third-largest source of methane pollution in Colorado, after agriculture and fossil fuel extraction. Draft methane rules released last month by the state’s Department of Public Health and Environment would, for the first time, require some dump operators to measure and quantify methane releases and to fix leaks. The proposal mandates that waste managers install a gas collection system if their dump generates a certain amount of the climate-warming gas.

It also addresses loopholes in federal law that allow waste to sit for five years before such systems are required — even though science has shown that half of all food waste decays within about three-and-a-half years. The draft rule surpasses U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards in the amount of landfill area operators must monitor for emissions. It’s set to be heard by the state’s Air Quality Control Commission in August.

Proposed regulations require the elimination of open gas flares — burning emissions directly into the atmosphere — and urge the use of biocovers and biofilters, which rely on bacteria to break down gases. The 70-page draft also calls for more routine and thorough monitoring of a dump surface with advanced technologies like satellites, which recently recorded large plumes of methane escaping from a Denver-area landfill.

“We’ve had our eyes opened thanks to technology that has made the invisible, visible — now we know the extent of the problem, which is much greater than what estimates have portrayed,” said Katherine Blauvelt, circular economy director at Industrious Labs, a nonprofit working to decarbonize industry. “When landfill operators fail to control leaks, we know harmful pollutants are coming along for the ride.”

Cancer-causing volatile organic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, escape with methane leaching from landfills. These chemicals also contribute to the formation of lung-damaging ozone pollution, an increasing problem for the 3.6 million people who live in the greater Denver metropolitan area.

Indeed, the region along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains ranked sixth in the nation for the most polluted air — with unhealthy ozone levels reported on one out of every 10 days, on average, according to the American Lung Association’s 2025 “State of the Air” report. The state is also woefully behind in its compliance with federal air quality standards.

State officials and environmental advocates agree that reducing methane emissions from landfills, which are easier to mitigate than cow burps, for example, is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to slow warming in the short term.

“Waste deposited in landfills continues producing methane for decades as it breaks down — and it’s one sector where Colorado has yet to directly take action to reduce these greenhouse gases,” said Tim Taylor, a supervisor in the state’s air pollution control division, in an online hearing last February on the proposed landfill methane rules.

Colorado’s draft regulations are similar to those in California, Oregon, Maryland and Washington, he added. More than 10 landfills in the state are already required under federal rules to have gas collection and control systems. Yet even with such technology in place, disposal facilities routinely exceed federal methane emissions caps.

The state’s health department has also identified a dozen municipal solid waste landfills, based on a preliminary analysis, that would be required to put such systems in place under the proposed rules, Zachary Aedo, an agency spokesman, said in an email to Capital & Main.

Many of these facilities are operated by counties, some of which expressed concerns about their ability to pay for such systems.

“We are a small rural county, and a multimillion-dollar containment system is going to be more than we can build,” testified Delta County Commissioner Craig Fuller at the February hearing. “The financial equation of this whole thing is absolutely mind-boggling — we are struggling as it is to provide health and human services.”

Other county officials embraced the proposed tightening of rules.

“Landfills across Colorado, including in Eagle County, are leading sources of methane pollution,” said Eagle County Commissioner Matt Scherr in a March 6 statement. “As a local elected official I support a robust rule that embraces advanced technologies to cut pollution, protect public health and help the methane mitigation industry thrive.”

For larger landfill companies, like Waste Management, which operates 283 active disposal sites nationwide, figuring out which technology works to best monitor emissions from a dump’s surface is proving a complex challenge. The company is testing technologies at facilities with different topographies and climate fluctuations to understand what causes emissions releases, said Amy Banister, Waste Management senior director of air programs.

“Landfills are complicated, emissions vary over time, and we have emissions 24/7,” said Banister at an online meeting last September of a technical group created by Colorado health department officials. “Drones produced a lot of false positives — and we need more work understanding how fixed sensors can be applied in a landfill environment.”

State health officials suggested municipalities could offset the costs of installing gas collection systems at disposal sites by converting methane into energy. Several landfill operations in Colorado currently have such waste-to-energy systems — which send power they generate to the state’s power grid.

“We are mindful of the costs of complying with this rule and how tipping fees may be impacted,” said Taylor, an air quality supervisor, at the February hearing. “Analyses conducted in other states of their landfill methane rules found there wasn’t an increase in tipping fees as a result of regulations over time.”

Tipping fees are paid by those who dispose of waste in a landfill. If operators passed on compliance costs to households, a state analysis found, the yearly average annual fee would increase $22.90 per household.

Compliance violations

Colorado’s push comes as the EPA issued an enforcement alert in September that found “recurring Clean Air Act compliance issues” at municipal solid waste landfills that led to the “significant release of methane,” based on 100 inspections conducted over three years.

Such violations included improper design and installation of gas collection and control systems, failure to maintain adequate “cover integrity” and improper monitoring of facilities for emissions.

To address gaps in federal regulations, which require operators to measure emissions four times a year by walking in a grid pattern across the face of the landfill with a handheld sensor, Colorado’s draft rules require third-party monitoring. Such measurements must be conducted offsite by an entity approved by the state’s air pollution control division that uses a satellite, aircraft or mobile monitoring platform.

The infrequency of such grid walks — which skip spots that operators deem dangerous — contributes to the undercounting of methane emissions from landfills, according to a satellite-based analysis. An international team of scientists estimated potent greenhouse gas emissions from landfills are 50% higher than EPA estimates. Satellites like one operated by nonprofit Carbon Mapper found large methane plumes outside the quarterly monitoring periods over the Tower Landfill in Commerce City, northeast of Denver.

The satellite allowed scientists to see parts of the landfill not accessible with traditional monitoring — measurements that found that such landfills are underreporting their methane emissions to state regulators, said Tia Scarpelli, a research scientist and waste sector lead at Carbon Mapper.

“Landfill emissions tend to be quite persistent — if a landfill is emitting when it’s first observed, it’s likely to be emitting later on,” she added. Scarpelli cautioned that it’s important for regulators to investigate with operators what was happening on the landfill surface at the time the leak was measured.

Tower Landfill’s operator, Allied Waste Systems of Colorado LLC, provided reasons for such large methane releases in a January 2024 report to the state’s health department, including equipment malfunctions. The fix for about 22 emissions events over the federal methane limits detected in August 2023 by surface monitoring: “Soil added as cover maintenance.”

Like many dumps across Colorado and the nation, the Tower Landfill is located near a community that’s already disproportionately impacted by emissions from industrial activities.

“These landfills are not only driving climate change, they are also driving a public health crisis in our community,” said Guadalupe Solis, director of environmental justice programs at Cultivando, a nonprofit led by Latina and Indigenous women in northern Denver. “The Tower Landfill is near nursing homes, clinics, near schools with majority Hispanic students.”

Physicians in the state warned that those who live the closest to dumps suffer the worst health effects from pollutants like benzene and hydrogen sulfide, which are linked to cancer, heart and other health conditions.

“People living near landfills, like myself, my family and my patients, experience higher exposure to air pollution,” testified Dr. Nikita Habermehl, a specialist in pediatric emergency medicine who lives near a landfill in Larimer County, at the Feb. 26 public hearing, “leading to increased rates of respiratory issues and headaches and asthma worsened by poor air quality.”

Superfund sites are often silent legacies of America’s industrial past — places where decades of chemical dumping and poor oversight have poisoned soil, water, and people. The Reilly Tar site, which operated for over a century, sits in a working-class neighborhood where residents have long lived in the shadow of chemical fumes and cancer fears. Like many Superfund locations, it tells a story not just of contamination, but of environmental injustice: where low-income families and people of color are disproportionately exposed to pollution. These communities often lack the political power to push back or the resources to move away. Though production at the site has stopped, the chemicals it left behind—like benzene, a known carcinogen — can persist underground and in the air for decades. The EPA’s new cleanup plan aims to accelerate remediation, but even the best-case scenarios stretch across generations.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60339807/origin.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:14:36.170729

Low-Energy Fridays: Is lightning-fast permitting possible?

Under the Trump administration’s executive order (EO) 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” the Department of the Interior (DOI) has created an “alternative arrangement” process for some energy permits that could enable a major project to receive a permit in as little as 28 days instead of the usual two to four years. But is this actually possible? And if it’s so easy, why hasn’t it been done before? The simple answer is that, while this approach may score some near-term victories, it could potentially create more problems than it solves.

Extraordinary permitting delays have been a concern for both parties for some time now. Because some projects take over a decade to be permitted, politicians seeking to get more built want to make adjustments to expedite the process. One of the main factors in these delays is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which governs compliance with environmental statutes for new infrastructure projects.

Projects do not have a “significant environmental impact” under NEPA guidelines in about 99 percent of cases, but exceptionally large—and economically noteworthy—projects almost always have a significant environmental impact. Consequently, they are required to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of their permit under NEPA, which kicks off a multi-year permitting process. Because any major infrastructure project is likely to require an EIS, the protracted timelines are often pegged as an underlying reason for delayed infrastructure development. However, in some emergency situations, an “alternative arrangement” for NEPA compliance may be used, and the DOI is arguing that President Donald J. Trump’s EO justifies utilization of this procedure. The new alternative NEPA process, which can apply to projects needing a permit under the DOI, would cut this to 28 days for most energy types, though wind and solar power are notably ineligible. An assistant secretary or equivalent (i.e., a high-level political appointee) must approve its use. What, then, is different about the new process?

At surface level, the NEPA permitting process concludes with a Record of Decision (ROD) by the government noting that a project’s environmental impact has been evaluated and that relevant statutes (like those from the Endangered Species Act or the National Historic Preservation Act) have been complied with. The DOI’s new alternative arrangement for the NEPA process specifies that these laws must still be complied with, and this is where we encounter a problem: The reason it takes so long to prepare an EIS supporting an ROD is that it takes a long time to evaluate compliance.

Additionally, the government is frequently sued over its permits for environmentally significant projects, with 72 percent of the litigation coming from non-governmental organizations potentially seeking to delay projects. This type of litigation often challenges the adequacy of EISs, and courts must decide if supplemental materials should be prepared. Research has found a correlation between EIS preparation time and litigation outcomes, where agencies that take longer to prepare EISs fare better in court— leading some to find that litigation risk drives longer permitting timelines. Importantly, research has found that litigation rarely forces any change in a project’s construction. Proponents of litigation argue that this is important oversight ensuring quality permits from government and environmental protection, while critics argue that the litigation does not improve environmental quality and is merely used as a tactic to delay infrastructure deployment.

Getting back to the alternative NEPA arrangement, it is technically legal for the government to issue an ROD within any amount of time. The government can do this, and theoretically, the emergency authorities it relies on should override many of the statutory causes of permitting delay. But can the government successfully argue in court that it fully complied with all relevant statutes and requirements in such a short time? Probably not, especially considering that the DOI’s justification for relying on emergency authorities doesn’t fit within the definitions of the statute they invoke. So why bother at all?

The entire litigation process takes 4.2 years on average. During that process, the court tells the defendant (in this case, the government) exactly how their EIS is deficient and what supplemental materials must be prepared. From the standpoint of someone who wants to get as many projects built as quickly as possible, there is a temptation to cut out the middleman and go straight to the courts. After all, if legal uncertainty is what makes NEPA documents take so long to prepare, then why not force the courts to figure it out? Some of the political calculus there makes sense.

But from a policy perspective, this may cause more headaches than benefits. It isn’t likely that courts would sustain the idea that the 28-day EIS represents sufficient compliance. Instead of detailing what the EIS should contain, they may simply reject the idea that NEPA’s alternative arrangement represents a reasonable fulfillment of the law. Recent tariff news where courts rejected the idea that the president’s emergency authority applies to non-emergency situations puts further doubt on a court victory for the DOI. Projects would take even longer to get permitted under such a scenario.

The bigger issue is that if the courts sustain this alternative arrangement, then it opens the door to all sorts of political shenanigans that would make the permitting process even more susceptible to the whims of politicians. (To a certain extent, this is a road we have already been down—arguably since the Keystone XL pipeline controversy.) The politicization of permits has worsened over time, and while those in power may see this as an opportunity to score some wins for their side, the broader economic effect is decidedly negative. If investors believe that constructing a major energy project in the United States depends upon electoral outcomes, the result will be more risk and less investment. And if that happens, we’ll probably end up with less long-run productivity and higher long-run energy costs.

Ignoring the legal uncertainty of the DOI’s alternative NEPA process for a moment, the key question is whether politicians should be responsible for choosing who can get a fast permit and who cannot. Put another way, should the government be in the business of picking winners and losers? The emphatic economic answer is no, as politicians can never be as effective as the market at steering investment. Better policy would result from Congress addressing the systemic causes of permitting delays without political preference for the types of projects permitted, but we’re not quite there yet.

Ultimately, the DOI’s new permitting policies are a product of the current political environment and congressional inaction. But if we want the sort of structural permitting reform that gets America building things again, we’re going to need less politicking on permits rather than more.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/permits.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 12:24:05.081647

Katie Surma, Georgina Gustin and Nicholas Kusnetz report for Inside Climate News.

In short:

A Boston University analysis found 68% of China’s overseas energy investments in 2022–2023 went to solar and wind, up from just 13% between 2000 and 2021.

While new coal plant financing has stopped, earlier investments continue to result in new coal power plants coming online, which could emit as much CO₂ annually as Austria.

China’s shift is partly driven by a need to export surplus renewable technology amid economic challenges and has included a recent $51 billion pledge to support low-carbon energy in Africa.

Key quote:

China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.”

— Xi Jinping, president of China

Why this matters:

The shift in China's overseas energy financing has far-reaching implications for both global carbon emissions and the geopolitics of clean energy. While Beijing's move away from coal-backed infrastructure projects aligns with climate goals, the follow-through on existing fossil fuel investments continues to embed long-term carbon pollution in developing nations. These coal projects, built decades after wealthy nations began cutting back on such infrastructure, risk locking lower-income countries into emissions-intensive economies just as the global push to decarbonize accelerates. Environmental groups remain concerned about how this dual strategy affects vulnerable regions, especially as countries in Africa and Southeast Asia weigh economic growth against environmental health.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has “de-obligated” the loan guarantee, meaning the federal government is no longer responsible for the financing.

The move comes as Sunnova is restructuring its debt and has expressed concerns about its ability to continue operations.

Sunnova stated in a regulatory filing in March 2025 that it did not plan to utilise the DoE facility, known as Project Hestia, in the foreseeable future.

The previous administration under former President Joe Biden announced a partial loan guarantee in April 2023 to support financing for 100,000 rooftop solar installations, particularly for lower-income homeowners.

Under Biden, the DoE’s Loan Programs Office aimed to accelerate clean energy sector development by providing loans to companies that found it difficult to secure private funding.

The Energy Department described Project Hestia as the largest US government commitment to solar power at that time.

However, the residential solar sector has faced challenges due to increased interest rates, which have raised the cost of financing.

Sunnova has issued $371m in bonds backed by the Project Hestia loan guarantee. These bonds are not part of the debt Sunnova is currently looking to restructure.

Project Hestia became less appealing to Sunnova because the company could offer more affordable leased systems to homeowners, capitalising on tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced by Biden.

The tax credits for loans, which were the focus of Project Hestia, are considered less beneficial.

The current administration, led by President Donald Trump, is prioritising oil and gas production and has indicated a review of DoE financing for alternative energy companies.

The future of the loans office is uncertain, with job reductions implemented by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and budget cuts proposed in the House budget bill.

Since 2009, the office has issued $35bn in loans and loan guarantees, with repayments from companies including Tesla.

However, it has faced criticism from Republicans since 2011 following a $535m loan to Solyndra, a solar company that later failed.

Even Genesis, the group’s luxury brand, has shifted from a strategy of full electrification to include hybrid configurations in its product line-up in response to the rising popularity of such vehicles.

In 2011, Hyundai introduced its first full hybrid system, known as the “Transmission Mounted Electrical Device” (TMED), with the Sonata model in Korea. This proprietary series-hybrid system features an electric motor positioned between the engine and transmission — referred to as the P2 configuration — and utilizes a dual-clutch mechanism to manage power distribution. Additionally, this system can operate solely on electric power under certain conditions. Over the past decade, Hyundai has integrated this hybrid system into several of its models. Sales of its Full Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FHEVs) surged from over 222k units in 2020 to more than 770k units in 2024, with an average growth rate of 36% and accounting for approximately 14% of its global Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales.

However, Hyundai’s hybrid system began to lag in fuel economy and driving performance compared to the latest models from competitors. As a result, in April 2025, the group unveiled its new Full Hybrid powertrain, known as TMED-II, which will debut in the latest Hyundai Palisade. The enhanced hybrid system not only retains the P2 motor at the transmission input but also integrates an additional motor at the engine output, known as the P1 configuration. The group claims that this innovation significantly improves fuel economy over the previous generation. Furthermore, Hyundai plans to incorporate the new hybrid system into three vehicle categories: Large, Midsize, and Compact. The same system architecture is also set to be implemented in the longitudinal powertrains of Genesis models.

It is anticipated that the next-generation Hyundai hybrid system will enhance performance and fuel efficiency across various segments. The group asserts that this new hybrid system offers a 45% improvement in fuel economy and a 29% increase in power compared to Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) of the same category.

We expect increased FHEV market penetration in the B and E segments, particularly in the B segment within emerging markets like India, where FHEVs are likely to replace diesel vehicles. Meanwhile, growth in the E segment is expected to be driven by Large SUVs from the Hyundai and Kia brands, as well as Genesis models. By 2030, our projections indicate that the group will expand its FHEV presence to approximately 1.3 mn units worldwide, representing over 21% of its global sales.

However, as global demand for EVs rises due to technological advancements and stricter emission regulations, the growth of FHEVs is expected to slow in the latter part of the decade and eventually be surpassed by pure EVs. Nevertheless, FHEVs will continue to play a crucial role in the group’s strategy to achieve its goal of full electrification.

As public transport operators and cities face increasing pressure to decarbonize fleets, charging infrastructure remains one of the most complex barriers to large-scale electric vehicle deployment. In this interview, Charlie Levine, Head of Global Strategy at Electreon, outlines how the company’s wireless charging technology offers a flexible, hands-free solution—both at rest and in motion.

From embedded coils in roadways to automated depot charging pads, Electreon’s system supports continuous vehicle operation without the need for oversized batteries or extensive grid upgrades. Levine discusses the benefits of “opportunity charging,” the operational lessons learned from large-scale deployments such as the Electra Afikim depot in Israel, and how wireless charging is being integrated into Bus Rapid Transit systems and mixed-use urban fleets around the world.

She also touches on OEM partnerships, grid optimization, and the role wireless charging could play in enabling future autonomous transit networks.

Charlie Levin, Electreon’s goal? “Removing charging as a barrier”

For those just discovering Electreon — what’s the company’s story, and how does your wireless charging work both in motion and at rest?

Electreon was founded with a clear mission: to accelerate the shift to electric mobility by removing charging as a barrier—starting with eliminating cables. Our wireless technology, embedded in roads or installed at key points, allows all types of EVs—including buses—to charge while driving, stopping, or parked at the depot.

Using electromagnetic induction, coils beneath the road transfer energy to receivers on the vehicle. It’s hands-free, invisible, and vehicle-agnostic—ideal for urban areas, depots, and varied parking layouts. The modular system reduces both upfront and long-term costs and supports today’s fleets and future autonomous vehicles.

Your team often mentions “Opportunity charging.” Why is that idea so central to your approach?

“Opportunity Charging” is our approach to smarter, more flexible charging. Instead of relying only on long overnight depot sessions, Electreon’s system delivers small energy top-ups throughout the day—during stops, passenger loading, or even a quick lunch break. This enables continuous operation without disrupting schedules.

By spreading energy use across the day, the system reduces strain on the grid—especially during peak hours—and gives operators full flexibility over when, how much, and how long to charge.

This model also promotes battery health by avoiding deep discharges and fast charging, helping extend battery life and reduce the need for oversized packs. Most importantly, it eliminates range anxiety—ensuring buses always have enough energy to complete their routes without needing backup vehicles. With wireless charging available throughout the day, operations become more predictable, cost-effective, and comparable to traditional ICE fleets.

The value of wireless charging in public transport

Where does wireless charging offer the most value in public transit—BRTs, city buses, or depots?

For BRT systems, our in-motion charging turns each station into a charging point—enabling fleet growth without the need for additional infrastructure. It eliminates mid-day downtime and supports smaller, lighter batteries, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

City buses benefit from stationary wireless charging at high-frequency stops or layovers where plug-in options aren’t practical.

At depots, embedded wireless charging creates a fully automated experience—no cables, no human handling, no scheduling. Ideal for dense depots or mixed fleets, with low-power, distributed grid connections that avoid major electrical upgrades.

The system is modular and scalable—each charging point works independently, offering built-in redundancy and future-ready flexibility for growing electric fleets.

Let’s talk about the Electra Afikim bus depot project in Israel. What lessons came from running wireless charging across a full electric bus fleet?

That project demonstrated what wireless charging can deliver at scale. Electreon’s system, deployed across eight Management Units and supporting up to 32 buses, achieved 99% operational uptime, over 90% energy transfer efficiency, and 92% of buses starting the day with more than 90% charge.

Daytime charging added 4 MWh/month—enabling 100 extra operational hours and cutting standby bus use to near zero. Peak overnight demand was reduced by 48%, slashing infrastructure and energy costs.

With real-time monitoring and a fully hands-free setup, operators gain full control—no cables, no reliance on drivers. The system is now expanding to the Ovnat Terminal, raising daytime wireless charging to 12%, adding 12,000 km per month, improving grid balance, and enabling reliable, scalable EV operations.

Charlie Levin: the benefits of an invisible system…

Cities often face space, grid, or range challenges when electrifying bus fleets. How does Electreon help overcome them?

Our system is purpose-built to solve these challenges. Firstly, it’s nearly invisible: no bulky hardware or above-ground units, just flush-mounted coils that preserve street space. This makes it ideal for curbside, terminal, and depot integration in dense cities.

Secondly, because the system spreads energy demand across multiple low-power points, it avoids peak loads and simplifies the required grid connection and configuration. This is especially helpful where grid capacity is limited or expensive to upgrade.

And finally, range becomes a non-issue. Buses charge while in operation, which means they don’t need to carry oversized batteries. That reduces vehicle weight and cost and increases route flexibility.

BRT systems are gaining traction as efficient, high-capacity solutions for urban mobility. How can Electreon’s wireless charging technology support their deployment and long-term scalability?

BRT systems are a perfect fit for dynamic wireless charging. Their fixed, predictable routes allow cities to embed charging coils at key points—supporting high-frequency service without disrupting operations.

In Trondheim, Norway, Electreon is proving how this model enables continuous service, even in harsh conditions like freezing winters and hilly terrain. These environments increase energy consumption and strain conventional charging systems. By placing wireless charging at strategic locations along the route, buses get energy where and when they need it—without leaving the route or extending layovers.

This approach also reduces reliance on high-power depot infrastructure. Distributed, low-power charging along the route makes the system modular, tamper-proof, and space-efficient—while cutting costs across batteries, infrastructure, and energy. Plus, it’s built for future autonomous fleets.

Electreon: moving from demo to commercial deployment

From Detroit to Tel Aviv to Norway—where is Electreon gaining the most traction, and what’s driving it?

We’re seeing traction in regions that combine political will with a practical need to solve electrification challenges. In the U.S., projects like Michigan Central Station are focused on innovation and public-private collaboration. In Israel, it’s about optimizing operations in dense cities. And in Norway, sustainability goals are tightly aligned with technology pilots that scale quickly.

What’s driving momentum is the ability to move from demonstration to commercial deployment. Cities and transit agencies aren’t just looking for future-proof tech—they want tech that works now and integrates with existing systems. Wireless charging, when done right, ticks those boxes.

What role do automakers play in wireless charging—and how is Electreon partnering with OEMs?

OEM collaboration is key. We work with manufacturers and integrators to equip vehicles with Electreon receivers—either in-factory or through retrofits. For example, our partnership with Toyota is focused on scaling production and reducing installation complexity.

Because our system is vehicle-agnostic, we’re able to support a wide range of fleets, from buses to last-mile vans. We’re also working with suppliers to standardize integration for easier adoption across the industry.

What might a fully wireless-powered bus network look like five or ten years from now?

In the near future, wireless charging will be a backbone of smart transit systems. Imagine a city where electric buses never stop to charge. Instead, they gain energy passively throughout the day—reducing downtime, eliminating range anxiety, and lowering grid stress.

Battery sizes will shrink, vehicle weight and cost will drop, and autonomous fleets will become viable—no cables, no manual tasks, no errors. For operators, it’s less maintenance and greater efficiency. For cities, it’s cleaner air, more reliable service, and future-ready infrastructure.

Most importantly, this is a one-time investment. Install the wireless infrastructure once, and it will support both today’s e-fleets and the autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.

Where can people see your technology in action today?

If you’re attending UITP in Hamburg this June, I’d love to invite you to my session titled Accelerating the E-Transition: Smart Charging Infrastructure and Depot Management, taking place on 16 June from 16:00 to 17:00 in Expo Session B (Hall A4). You can also visit the Electreon booth (Hall A2 – Stand: A2452) to meet the team and explore how wireless charging could benefit your fleet.

Beyond the event, we have commercial and pilot projects operating in the U.S., Europe, and Israel. These projects are open for visits by transit agencies, policymakers, and industry professionals. If you’re evaluating charging solutions, we’d be happy to show you the system in action.",https://www.sustainable-bus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/autobus-sb-technical-focus-inchiesta-dalla-rivista-22.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 07:00:38.510137

According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), the number of registered EVs in Forsyth and Guilford counties rose from 442 and 799 in February 2020 to 927 and 1,454 in 2022, and further to 2,075 and 3,262 in February 2024.

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Timothy Johnson, professor of the Practice of Energy and the Environment at Duke University, noted that while both counties’ growth rates appear impressive, they still represent an “increase from a relatively small number,” a trend seen across much of the country, except in states like California, where demand is significantly higher.

“You've seen a much greater market share of EVs in other countries — Denmark, and some of the other Nordic countries, as well as China, are going gangbusters on electric vehicles. We're just not seeing that in the U.S.”

In a survey published by EY last year, only 34% of U.S. consumers intending to buy a new vehicle in the next 24 months planned to purchase an EV, marking a 14% decrease from 48% in 2023. A lack of charging stations, limited driving range, battery life and expensive maintenance fees were among the key factors contributing to this decline, as cited by the survey.

How EVs help cut carbon

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has aligned with the president’s pro-coal stance, often promoting his “Drill, baby, drill” slogan and praising Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s calls to keep coal plants active in the country in its social media posts.

Nonetheless, the department’s website emphasizes a different message, stating that using hybrid vehicles and EVs “supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet.”

“The multiple fuel sources used to generate electricity result in a more secure energy source for the electrified portion of the transportation sector,” it adds.

In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper set a statewide goal of reaching 1.25 million registered zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 under Executive Order 246. His earlier goal of reaching 80,000 registered EVs by 2025, outlined in Executive Order 80, was surpassed in November 2023, which Gov. Josh Stein praised the achievement then as a reflection of the state’s commitment to the EV sector.

“Most EVs will automatically reduce life-cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 50% from their gasoline powered counterparts,” said Noah Kittner, an assistant professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The U.S. Department of Energy states that a small electric SUV produces 52% fewer life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline vehicle.

The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States, and greenhouse gases are the key contributors to climate change, driving rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, which impact both the environment and public health, as noted by researchers and scientists around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The biggest environmental benefits of electric vehicles have to do with air quality and pollutant emissions…shifting from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles moves the emissions to power plants, which are far fewer in number, and since they don't move around, they're easier to control,” Johnson said.

Why EVs make economic sense — but policy still lags

Mark Curtis, associate professor and Reynolds Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, explained that EVs are “simply better products than internal combustion cars” from an economic standpoint.

“They are cheaper to own over the life of the car, they require less maintenance, and they perform better,” Curtis said. “They accelerate faster, have fewer parts, and don’t need oil changes or regular engine repairs. For most drivers, especially those who can charge at home, they are already the better option.”

According to a 2020 analysis by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Idaho National Laboratory (INL), drivers can save up to $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years by choosing an electric vehicle instead of a similar gasoline-powered one.

Gas-powered cars, Curtis added, create significant economic costs by negatively impacting people's health and reducing their productivity.

“Yet under current rules, those damages are not priced into the cost of driving,” Curtis said.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives. Instead, Duke Energy offers a one-time rebate of up to $1,133 to help households prepare for at-home EV charging, which Curtis noted as “particularly relevant” in Winston-Salem and Greensboro, where many residents live in single-family homes.

“It’s worth noting that utilities have an interest in encouraging EV charging at certain times because it could actually save the utilities money in terms of grid operational costs and distribution system upgrades,” Kittner said.

Kittner expressed skepticism, however, about North Carolina adopting incentives or rebates, pointing out the recent decision by the N.C. General Assembly to raise the annual registration fee for fully electric vehicles from $140 to $180.

“Recent policies suggest that there may be additional fees levied on EV owners,” he added. “So it seems the current proposals are increasing costs of adoption rather than providing new rebates or incentives.”

CLEAN FUEL PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Z) The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.","On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed its reconciliation bill, H.R. 1, entitled “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the “legislation”), which significantly amends the clean energy provisions that were enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). Now the revised legislation advances to the Senate, where it is likely to be amended before both chambers reconcile their differences and finalize the legislation for the President’s approval or veto. Although the legislation is not final and could change before final enactment, its impact on the clean energy provisions enacted as part of the IRA warrants attention from investors, developers, manufacturers, and financiers that rely on these provisions. The legislation imposes a number of significant changes to the IRA, including the elimination of the investment tax credit and production tax credit under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively, for any facilities that are not under construction prior to the date that is 60 days after enactment and a full repeal of the EV credits. Below is a summary of key provisions in the legislation most likely to affect energy and manufacturing transactions.

PHASE-OUTS AND TERMINATIONS OF ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING CREDITS

Under the legislation, several energy-related credits are phased out or terminated. The legislation accelerates the sunset of numerous credits which, under current law, run well into the 2030s or have no fixed end date.

1. CLEAN ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Y) AND CLEAN ELECTRICITY INVESTMENT CREDIT (SECTION 48E)

The clean electricity production tax credit (the “PTC”) and the clean electricity investment tax credit (“ITC”) are very important components of the IRA. These two tech-neutral credits apply to investments in qualifying clean electricity generation or storage property. The PTC and ITC took effect at the beginning of 2025 and are available to all new zero-emission electricity production facilities. Under current law, the PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032, or when the US power sector reaches 25 percent of 2022 emissions levels, whichever is later.

The legislation significantly accelerates the elimination of these credits. The ITC and PTC are repealed for projects beginning construction more than 60 days after enactment of the legislation. Additionally, in order to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2028. This is a significant departure from prior repeals and sunsets of the credits, in which Congress solely used a “beginning of construction” standard as a transition rule. The two-pronged transition rule under the legislation means that developers will be required to quickly incur 5% of a project’s cost or begin physical work of a significant nature, but doing so will not grandfather the qualification of a project that fails to be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028. Additionally, the legislation specifically eliminates the credit for residential wind and solar leasing arrangements beginning on the day the legislation is enacted.

The effective date of the FEOC restrictions would vary depending on the specific FEOC restriction, as follows: (i) for taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity,” effective immediately for tax years beginning after enactment; (ii) for projects the construction of which includes any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” effective for facilities beginning construction after one year from enactment; and (iii) for taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity,” effective in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

In addition, 100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a “specified taxpayer” makes an “applicable payment” within ten years after the property is placed in service. This is longer than the typical five-year recapture period and does not include a step-down during the recapture period.

2. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45X)

The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit provides a credit for domestic production of key clean energy components like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals. Under the legislation, a phased reduction of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit begins in 2029. Production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify, one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027, and the general phase-out mirrors the 45Y/48E schedule. Under current law, full credit is available through 2029 with a softer ramp-down (75% in 2030, 50 % in 2031, 25% in 2032, and zero thereafter). Similar to 45X, the nuclear production tax credit (45U) ends on December 31, 2031, one year earlier than current law.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers that are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment, taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity” with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning two years after enactment, and eligible components produced in tax years beginning two years after enactment that (i) include any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreement with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

3. CLEAN FUEL PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Under current law, the credit is available for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2028. The legislation extends the Clean Fuel Production Credit to make credits available for fuels sold through December 31, 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment and taxpayers who are a “foreign-influenced entity” in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

FOREIGN ENTITY OF CONCERN LIMITATION

The legislation significantly expands the existing concept of a foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) found in other parts of the Code by introducing new criteria and definitions of a “prohibited foreign entity,” a “specified foreign entity,” and a “foreign-influenced entity.” Under the legislation, eligibility for the credits under Sections 45, 45Y, 48, 48E, or 45X (further discussed below) may be denied where a “prohibited foreign entity” is involved in certain aspects of the facility’s development or ownership (typically requiring meaningful connections to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran). The complexity of these rules will require careful planning to ensure compliance and no inadvertent foot fault.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: a broad category established in the legislation encompassing both “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

Specified Foreign Entity: any foreign entity of concern as defined in section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, entities identified as Chinese military companies operating in the United States, entities included on certain federal government lists, certain battery-producing entities, and any foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign Controlled Entity: an entity owned or controlled by the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), citizens or residents of such a nation (excluding US citizens or lawful permanent residents), entities organized under the laws of a covered nation, or entities controlled by any of the foregoing, an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity.

Foreign Influenced Entity: an entity will be classified as a “foreign-influenced entity” if:

During the taxable year, (i) a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; (iii) specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or (iv) one or more specified foreign entities collectively hold at least 25% of the entity’s debt.

In addition, an entity will also be deemed foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly makes, or had reason to know it made, payments of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amounts (each, an “applicable payment”) either: (i) in an amount equal to or exceeding 10% of the total of such payments to any single specified foreign entity, or (ii) in an aggregate amount equal to or exceeding 25% of the total of such payments to multiple specified foreign entities.

While “specified foreign entity” and “foreign controlled entity” are not new concepts (although, as discussed below, the legislation would expand their applicability to more credits), the “foreign influenced entity” is a new category of FEOC. Presumably, these expansions are designed to capture both direct and indirect foreign influence or control, particularly from countries or organizations deemed adversarial or high risk, and serve as the basis for restricting access to certain federal tax benefits.

As discussed in more detail below, under the legislation, a taxpayer classified as a specified foreign entity would be ineligible to claim any credit for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. For taxpayers falling into certain less restrictive categories—such as foreign-influenced entities or those making payments to prohibited foreign entities—the legislation would generally bar eligibility for credits starting two years after the date of enactment.

The legislation applies the constructive ownership rules under Section 318, excluding Section 318(a)(3) related to partnerships, to determine whether an entity qualifies as a “prohibited foreign entity.” This exclusion of partnership attribution rules may prevent the application of Section 318 in the context of partnerships, narrowing the scope of entities deemed prohibited foreign entities through partnership relationships. However, the application of the remaining Section 318 rules could still pose significant challenges when assessing whether a US entity is treated as a prohibited foreign entity under the proposed FEOC restrictions. This raises compliance and structuring concerns, particularly for multinational holding company structures, and may call for a clarification or exception to avoid unintentionally sweeping US companies into the prohibited foreign entity definition solely through constructive ownership.

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE FROM AN FEOC

A broad restriction applies to any project that receives “material assistance” from an FEOC during construction. This is a new restriction that did not exist under the IRA. A facility is deemed to have received material assistance if:

It includes any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined under Section 45X(c)(6)) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity; or

Its design relies on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or know-how provided by such an entity.

However, the bill carves out a limited exception for assembly parts or “constituent materials” that are not uniquely designed or formulated for use in qualified facilities or eligible components under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X and are not predominantly produced, processed, or extracted by prohibited foreign entities. Although this exception is potentially helpful to the industry, the breadth of this exception may depend, in part, on how broadly “uniquely designed or formulated” is defined in subsequent guidance.

As discussed below, this “material assistance” restriction would generally bar eligibility for credits starting one or two years after the date of enactment, depending on the specific credit.

TRANSFERABILITY OF CERTAIN CLEAN ENERGY CREDITS REPEALED FOR FUTURE YEARS

The IRA permits most clean-energy credits to be sold by taxpayers, which has created a robust secondary market that has allowed sponsors with limited or no tax capacity to efficiently monetize these credits directly to raise capital. The legislation would unwind this regime for some forms of tax credits. The affected credits are those generated under Sections 45Q and Section 48(a)(3)(vii) (i.e., geothermal heat pump systems). The legislation would repeal transferability for projects that “begin construction” two years after the date that the legislation is enacted, which could be as early as July and most likely by August 2025. Accordingly, we expect the familiar “beginning of construction” rules (i.e., 5% safe harbor and physical work test) will apply to grandfather 45Q and geothermal projects that begin construction during the two-year window. Project developers should consider entering into beginning-of-construction arrangements, particularly the 5% safe harbor which is not project specific, to preserve the option of transferability, keeping in mind that a project generally must be placed in service within four years of the date upon which it began construction.

For Sections 45Z and 45X, transferability of credits is terminated after December 31, 2027, for electricity generated or fuels or components made after that date. The legislation does not retroactively disturb transfers executed for 2023-2025 credits, and market participants can still transact in credits generated before the repeal dates.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16300_1146.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 07:00:17.547246

Community & Worker Economic Transition Office launches MI Hub for Manufacturing with support from philanthropy

Michigan is a top 10 state for clean energy jobs, leads the nation for total jobs in advanced materials and has the fastest-growing workforce for energy-efficient HVAC and renewable heating and cooling

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. — The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Community & Worker Economic Transition Office announced a public-private partnership designed to create and retain good-paying jobs, support Michigan manufacturers and strengthen the state’s position as a global leader in the energy supply chain at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually — $2 billion from DTE and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses. This historic commitment is focused on strengthening local supply chains for critical energy infrastructure, such as transformers, and next-generation technologies, including solar components and long-duration energy storage systems.

""Michigan is paving the way growing our economy and meeting our ambitious energy goals,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Today, we’re launching new resources designed to support our manufacturers and help them create and retain good-paying jobs while building strong, resilient energy supply chains right here in Michigan. This partnership will position our manufacturers to lead in the clean energy future, keeping production local and ensure that Michigan remains a hub of innovation and industry. Let’s keep working hard to make a difference and build a Michigan where everyone can thrive.”

“We know we can keep Michigan as a leader in manufacturing, while also strengthening the prosperity of everyone in our state,” said Community & Worker Economic Transition Office Director Jonathan Smith. ""Through innovative partnerships like this one between government, industry, nonprofit organizations and philanthropy we can deliver powerful lasting, impactful solutions that help our businesses, workers and communities plan for and thrive in the future.""

The State of Michigan will work closely with DTE and Consumers Energy to identify in-state suppliers, help them retool to meet the energy sector’s needs and connect them with the resources necessary to grow and compete. The partnership will reduce long lead times for critical equipment and components that currently have few or zero domestic suppliers. Having more local suppliers also means keeping prices affordable for Michigan ratepayers.

“DTE has a long history of partnering with Michigan businesses to keep our spending local, and we’re proud to build on that history by committing to spend $2 billion annually with Michigan suppliers,” said Trevor Lauer, vice chairman and group president, DTE Energy. “Focusing on keeping our spending in-state has a transformative impact on the Michigan economy, allowing businesses to grow and creating thousands of jobs, while also helping DTE to build an agile supply chain that allows us to deliver the services our customers demand and deserve.”

The partnership will also help utilities more quickly and efficiently meet their reliability and resiliency goals, putting Michigan on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“We'd love to see Michigan’s manufacturing talent and expertise build the energy equipment we need right here at home,” said Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. “Cultivating and buying from a resilient, robust energy supply chain in Michigan continues Consumers Energy’s longstanding commitment to in-state suppliers. It’s the natural next step, and the right thing for Consumers Energy, our customers and the state.”

To help manufacturers and clean energy startups retool their facilities and retain their workers to support new work coming in from utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy, the Transition Office is also launching the MI Hub for Manufacturers. With $1.5 million in support from philanthropy and a partnership with Next Street, a national small business and supplier solutions company, this dynamic, interactive online platform will connect small and mid-sized manufactures to public, private and non-profit resources. The platform will publish funding opportunities, connect businesses to expert advisors and capital products, provide on-demand digital learning tools and host partner resources that can help suppliers diversify and grow to enter new supply chains.

“We are proud to partner with the State of Michigan to equip manufacturers with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive, grow, and lead in an evolving industrial landscape,” said CEO of Next Street, Charisse Conanan Johnson. “The MI Hub for Manufacturers is a powerful example of public-private partnership—bringing together government, philanthropy, industry, and community organizations to deliver real value to small and mid-sized businesses. Equitable economic growth starts by unlocking the full potential of our local supply chains, and Michigan is setting the standard for what that looks like.”

“The Community and Worker Economic Transition Office will help ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy,” Glenn Stevens Jr., Executive Director, MichAuto at the Detroit Regional Chamber. “This work resonates strongly with MichAuto's mission to ensure the state's signature automotive and mobility industry, Michigan, and its workers continue to lead the world in automotive manufacturing and innovation well into the future.”

The Community & Worker Economic Transition Office was created as part of a historic package of clean energy and climate bills passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Whitmer in 2023. The office will ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy.

However, if Congress cuts federal energy investments and tax credits, projects like these will immediately become less feasible and Michiganians will lose out.
Research shows that ratepayers will see energy bills go up if these federal tax credits and incentives disappear.
We need to create more good-paying union jobs that deliver reliable energy and preserve federal investments that make that possible.
Lawmakers ought to protect our future and open doors for working people by protecting federal energy incentives.","Right now, thousands of jobs are at stake in Michigan if Congress passes the House’s budget proposal, gutting clean energy tax credits. I know firsthand how devastating that would be for working families. When Palisades Nuclear Generating Station shut down in 2022, working families in southwest Michigan took a major hit. We lost a huge economic engine and hundreds of jobs, uprooting many local families and forcing folks into unemployment. Now, thanks to federal energy incentives and state funding, Palisades is coming back online and bringing hundreds of good union jobs that will provide family-supporting wages, benefits and opportunities for the next generation. Plus, this plant alone will produce 800 megawatts of homegrown electricity, enough to power 800,000 homes. As energy demand and electricity bills rise, we need this power now more than ever.

Before I was a business manager for International Brotherhood of Electricians (IBEW) Local 131, I was a journeyman electrician. In the 1990s, I worked on several projects at Palisades, including a project with about one hundred of my fellow union brothers and sisters to rebuild containment structures and steam generators. The return of the Palisades facility will give a new generation of Michiganians these same opportunities I benefited from. That’s only possible because of federal investments. These incentives are going to support upwards of 1,000 high-quality jobs created across more than a dozen unions for the modernization, maintenance and operation of this plant. These jobs will have family-supporting wages, healthcare, retirement security, rigorous safety standards and provide a collective voice on the job. Money that local workers earn is then put back into our local economy supporting our public schools and small businesses.

The re-opening of the Palisades plant will be a game-changer for many Michigan families and Palisades is only the tip of the iceberg: there are thousands more clean energy projects made possible by federal energy investments across the country. In Michigan alone, there are 108 utility-scale solar, wind and battery storage projects that could be eligible for federal energy tax credits, representing more than 29,000 jobs, $22 billion in investment, and nearly 14,000 megawatts of power generation and storage.

Right now, hundreds of union workers are constructing the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, and once this plant is completed by the end of the year, it’ll employ hundreds more to manufacture electric batteries. This small town has less than 7,000 people, but with this influx of approximately 1,700 jobs, the town and local area are going to be revived and invigorated. Water treatment, power lines, utilities and roads have all improved as a result of this clean energy project. Local job training opportunities through Michigan Works! ensure that people succeed for years to come in union careers. Quite simply, everything is improving in Marshall because of this project.

However, if Congress cuts federal energy investments and tax credits, projects like these will immediately become less feasible and Michiganians will lose out. Research shows that ratepayers will see energy bills go up if these federal tax credits and incentives disappear. If we want to protect jobs, protect ratepayers and build a strong energy independent future in Michigan, it’s imperative our representatives act to keep these incentives intact.

Michigan families feel the crunch of inflation and rising energy bills every day. We need to create more good-paying union jobs that deliver reliable energy and preserve federal investments that make that possible. Lawmakers ought to protect our future and open doors for working people by protecting federal energy incentives.

The justices handed down the lone decision Thursday morning, slightly curbing judicial authority at a time when President Donald Trump's administration is loudly complaining about alleged judicial overreach. The case, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, relates to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the requirement for environmental impact statements (EIS) in infrastructure projects supported by the federal government.

""NEPA does not allow courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the opinion of the court.

""Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness,"" the opinion continued.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW EL SALVADOR DEPORTATION FLIGHT CASE

Kavanaugh went on to state that agencies should not be expected to consider the environmental impact of any project aside from the one they are currently working on, ""even if"" the environmental impacts ""might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or materialize later in time.""

""The fact that the project might foreseeably lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project does not mean the agency must consider that separate project’s environmental effects,"" the court ruled.

Thursday's decision was an 8-0 ruling, with Justice Neil Gorsuch taking no part in the consideration of the case. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett joined with Kavanaugh's opinion.

FEDERAL COURT UPENDS DECADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Meanwhile, Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate concurring opinion, onto which joined Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The justice’s decision is based on a project in Utah in which the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition (SCIC) petitioned the Surface Transportation Board (STB) – which is a federal agency – to build an 88-mile railway to transport crude oil from Utah’s Uinta Basin to a national railway.

When the STZB released an EIS on the railway, opponents of the project in Eagle County, Colorado, argued the federal agency did not consider all the project’s environmental effects, which opponents claimed violated NEPA.

The case was presented to a D.C. Circuit Court, which ultimately ruled STB violated environmental law and that a new, more thorough review be conducted in order for the project to move forward. SCIC petitioned SCOTUS in the case in March 2024.

US SUPREME COURT HALTS EPA'S ‘GOOD NEIGHBOR’ RULE ON DOWNWIND POLLUTION

Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said she is ""deeply concerned"" about how the decision could hamper environmental justice and allow oil and gas companies to exploit public lands.

""This decision lays the groundwork for an environmental catastrophe,"" DeGette said. ""As the harsh impacts of the climate crisis increase the vulnerability of the Colorado River, the risk of an oil spill along this train route is unacceptable.

""Increasing fracking levels and transporting them across the country would not only harm the communities through which the train travels, including those in Denver, but it would further devastate the communities surrounding the facilities where this oil would burn.""

Trump, having a history in major construction projects, has repeatedly complained about environmental impact statements and the roadblocks they can cause.

NUMBER OF INJUNCTIONS HALTING TRUMP POLICIES TROUNCES PREDECESSORS BY DOUBLE

Republicans have also widely criticized what they see as judicial overreach in federal judges unilaterally blocking major aspects of Trump's agenda.

""Universal injunctions are an unconstitutional abuse of judicial power,"" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital earlier this month.

“It’s a scientific policy issue that should be decided by the political branches: the executive branch and Congress,” Chevron attorney Ted Boutrous told South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Roger Young in a hearing. “A string of cases from state courts and federal courts require dismissal.”

The office of South Carolina’s attorney general agrees.

“The state agrees entirely with the defense position here that their motion to dismiss should be granted entirely on the merits,” Ben McGray, assistant deputy solicitor with the South Carolina attorney general’s office, told the judge Thursday.

The U.S. Constitution prohibits one state from dictating or regulating conduct in another state, Gray said.

“Allowing the plantiffs’ claims to go forward, would this violate the equal dignity that is afforded each state in the union,” Gray said. “That’s inherent in our federal system.”

In the lawsuit filed in 2020, Charleston claimed the companies contributed to greenhouse gas pollution, global warming, and climate change by selling fossil fuel products.

In the lawsuit, Charleston seeks unspecified monetary damages from the oil and gas companies.

Attorneys for Charleston argued Thursday that the oil and gas companies knew that their products contributed to climate change but kept that from the public.

Vic Sher, one of Charleston’s attorneys, compared the Charleston climate change case to tobacco, opioid lawsuits and asbestos lawsuits.

Sher said as a result of climate change, Charleston will have to spend billions of dollars to construct sea walls and other mitigation measures. The lawsuit does not seek to dictate how other states handle climate change.

“It is about the money,” the attorney told the judge. “The complaint states that the purpose of the lawsuit is to transfer money from those who benefit from the misconduct – the wrongful promotion and marketing and the failures to warn – to the taxpayers who would otherwise have to bear that burden.”

Boutrous countered that Charleston is asking the oil and gas companies to pay for alleged climate change damage that “overwhelmingly occurred in other states, other countries.”

An estimated 87% of global carbon emissions are generated outside of the United States, he told the judge.

“Only .17% of greenhouse gas emissions originate in South Carolina,” he said.

The hearing is scheduled to resume Friday.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/floydct.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f62f46f0-a821-11e6-8414-d3c39780621c.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-05-30 07:01:18.495497

This threatens the operational stability of almost 300 facilities, jeopardizing 300,000 jobs and disrupting the renewable energy supply chain. A crucial factor is the introduction of “foreign entity of concern” rules, targeting Chinese suppliers. Many US facilities depend on global partners like VFD manufacturers in China, making the potential policy change a serious threat to supply continuity. These changes could also increase costs for VFD suppliers and disrupt planned capacity expansion.

How Will This Affect Solar Energy Generation and Pricing?

If the new IRA provisions pass, the US could lose 145TWh of solar energy generation capacity. This would directly impact electricity pricing, potentially causing significant hikes for consumers and businesses alike. Solar PV and energy storage technologies currently represent 84% of new capacity in 2024. The anticipated rise in demand due to AI and data centers could face major setbacks. VFD suppliers are essential to stabilizing renewable energy systems, and policy changes disrupting the solar sector could cascade into delays and shortages in essential electrical equipment globally.

What Does This Mean for US Tech and AI Growth?

The US energy shortfall resulting from IRA changes could cripple AI and data center expansion. Renewable energy, especially solar PV, is the fastest-growing and most cost-effective energy source. If US energy infrastructure fails to meet the expected AI-driven demand surge, it could result in widespread blackouts and cede technological leadership to competitors like China. VFD manufacturers in China and industrial inverter partners can provide critical technology support to mitigate these risks, offering scalable solutions to maintain stable power supplies for emerging tech applications.

How Can Global Suppliers Secure Their Position Amid Changes?

For global VFD manufacturers and VFD suppliers, the proposed IRA changes present both challenges and opportunities. With restrictions targeting “foreign entities of concern,” companies need to diversify supply chains and reinforce compliance with new regulations. One effective strategy is partnering with local US businesses or establishing regional manufacturing or assembly facilities. USFULL, a trusted VFD supplier, is well-positioned to offer flexible solutions, including product customization, local compliance support, and seamless logistics management. This positions global suppliers as indispensable partners, ensuring stability despite regulatory changes.

The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company's broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)'s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

""This project is a testament to what's possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,"" said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. ""From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we're proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.""

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL's manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA's largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company's ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

""We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we're taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. ""We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.""

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project's final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA's own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an ""energy community,"" designated due to the area's unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

""From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,"" said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. ""The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.""

Now, many of those efforts are at risk of disappearing.

Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency abruptly ended a Biden-era program that funded environmental justice efforts across the country. In the Mountains and Plains region alone, including Colorado, Utah and four other states, nearly $50 million was lost.

Among the casualties: at least two Boulder-based groups that lost nearly all their funding, and a third that was preparing to launch a new program.

FLOWS (Foundations for Leaders Organizing for Water and Sustainability) lost a $250,000 federal grant, all of its funding for 2026 and more than half for 2025.

“For a grassroots group like ours, this is a significant cut to our budget,” said Michelle Gabrieloff-Parish, FLOWS’ founder. “A $250,000 grant is so little compared to federal spending, but it’s so much for a community-based group like ours.”

The eliminated funding came from the EPA’s regional grant hubs under the Justice40 Initiative, Biden’s effort to direct 40% of federal climate investments to communities historically burdened by pollution and extreme weather disasters.

On May 2, the agency announced it was cutting the regional grants hubs, stating they were no longer aligned with its funding priorities. Days later, the hubs shut down, staff were laid off and millions in promised grants to hundreds of organizations vanished.

In Boulder County, the impact was swift and wide-ranging:

FLOWS lost $250,000, all its funding for 2026 and over half for 2025. Founded over a decade ago, it’s considered Boulder’s longest-running environmental justice group.

The Boulder County Climate Justice Collaborative lost $150,000, more than 90% of its budget, intended to support community advocacy around coal ash contamination at the Valmont Power Station.

Community-Led Preparedness Training, a disaster preparedness program sponsored by the city and others, was expecting a second-round EPA grant but now has no funding to train frontline communities for climate-related disasters like the Marshall Fire.

A statement from the Mountains and Plains grants hub, established by the EPA in 2022, called the decision to cut the grants “deeply” disappointing.

“The goal was to fund solutions to serious environmental challenges in underserved communities — from providing clean drinking water to ensuring food access, climate readiness and more,” the statement read. “We received nearly 550 applications, requesting over $137 million — a clear sign of both the urgency and the local energy behind this work.”

What Boulder’s lost funding would have done

FLOWS had planned to use the grant to expand work on clean water access at the San Lazaro mobile home community, where residents have endured foul-smelling and -tasting water sourced from a nearby trout pond for more than 15 years.

“Water is a human right,” Gabrieloff-Parish said. “The loss of this funding doesn’t just pause a project – it puts a frontline community’s well-being at risk.”

The group was also planning two other initiatives: an ecosystem restoration project at Tantra Lake affordable housing and a long-planned climate resilience hub.

The restoration project would have replaced turf with native plants and rain gardens while educating residents about Indigenous land practices and water stewardship. It may continue at a smaller scale, if other funding comes through.

The resilience hub, which FLOWS has championed since 2016, would have served as a neighborhood resource for planning how to respond to wildfires, floods and other climate-related disasters and use water and energy more sustainably. It is now delayed indefinitely.

“This should be a priority for the whole community,” Gabrieloff-Parish said. “There’s climate action to try to prevent the changes that are coming, but adaptation and resilience building has to be a part of our strategy now.”

She said FLOWS is unique because it builds leadership from within the communities it serves, rather than imposing outside solutions and walking away. The group’s three staff members – whose jobs are now in jeopardy – all come from frontline communities themselves.

“We want to be a part of identifying the problems and naming the solutions that we’d like to see,” she said. “We’re not just looking for free stuff like heat pumps or solar panels.”

Coal ash contamination and fears of being silenced

The Boulder County Climate Justice Collaborative was planning to use its EPA grant to help residents respond to coal ash pollution from Xcel Energy’s Valmont Power Station, located just outside Boulder city limits. A 2023 Boulder Reporting Lab investigation found that coal ash, which contains toxic metals like arsenic and cobalt, stored at the site is in direct contact with groundwater and appears to be migrating slowly underground toward homes. As Xcel Energy prepares to clean up the site, new concerns have emerged about the potential air quality impacts of disturbing and releasing the ash into the air.

According to Alejandro Murillo, a member of the group’s steering committee, the EPA grant would have funded training for community members on how to provide public comment on Xcel’s cleanup permits, especially the one addressing air quality risks. It also would have supported community efforts to monitor air quality independently of Xcel, and connected residents with public health officials who could provide resources in case they experienced health issues related to the coal ash.

Now, that work is in limbo. EPA funding represented about 90% of the project’s budget.

“We’re going to make do with what we have,” Murillo said. “Given general federal administration changes, a lot of people also just don’t feel comfortable going to a training, so we’ve had to rethink that as well.”

Murillo added that fear is growing among the community, especially undocumented and Latino residents, due to Trump policies targeting immigrants.

“It’s very possible that some of these agencies could show up to this event without our knowing, and we don’t want to put people at risk of that,” he said. “So that’s why we’ve stopped all of our in-person team meetings.”

The group may hold one online training in lieu of four in-person ones, but Murillo said it won’t have the same impact.

“The suppression of voices, while maybe indirect, is definitely felt,” he said. “People are just nervous, and with good reason.”

He added that the EPA rules like the one that forced Xcel to address the coal ash pollution in the first place may be compromised if the agency continues to roll back or defund regulations.

“Here is a local source of pollution that’s literally contaminating groundwater [and] could be contaminating our air once the work gets done,” he said. “But [environmental] regulations are just being thrown out.”

“Without the EPA intact, we might have never known that this was a problem and this needed to get fixed.”

‘We need a local Justice40’

With the federal program gone, advocates like Gabrieloff-Parish are turning their focus to local government.

“We don’t have the federal Justice40, but we could have a local Justice40,” she said. ” “Climate is a priority of the county; it’s a priority of the City of Boulder. This whole state is really committed to climate. Let’s make it environmental justice, not just environment.”

She’s calling on local governments to adopt similar commitments — directing 40% of their climate spending to underserved communities.

With that investment, she said the communities most vulnerable to climate change could “be a part of the transition that we’re making locally.”",https://boulderreportinglab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3150-ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-converter-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 05:03:33.421533

For instance, its factory in Georgetown, Kentucky, is the biggest Toyota factory in the world.
The other new EV will be assembled at the Toyota factory in Princeton, Indiana, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year.
Toyota says it expects the share of battery electric cars in the American market to nearly double by 2030.
AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects them to stabilize at 3.3% over the coming years.","The car industry is buzzing with news about Toyota — yes, Toyota — announcing it has big plans to bring more battery-powered electric and plug-in hybrid models to customers in the US between now and the end of the decade. Wait, Toyota said that? Yes, Virginia, it did.

Cheater Dawson of Bloomberg reports that stodgy Toyota has announced plans to manufacture two new battery electric vehicles in the US. By two years from now, a total of seven Toyota EVs will be in the company’s US showrooms. Those US-made EVs will join three other new EV’s imported from Japan — the bZ Woodland, the all new CH-R, and a version of the Lexus ES sedan — and the two EVs currently available in America — the Toyota bZ (previously known as the bZ4X) and the Lexus RZ. 80% of Toyota and Lexus models sold in the US today offer customers a choice of a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Bloomberg notes that Toyota typically does not add a new model to a factory unless it expects to sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production is in full swing. For instance, its factory in Georgetown, Kentucky, is the biggest Toyota factory in the world. It cranks out 550,000 versions of the RAV4, Camry, and Lexus ES a year. Now one of the new battery-electric models will be built there as well. The Camry went all-hybrid last year, and the company will stop offering a gasoline-only version of the RAV4 in its next model year.

The other new EV will be assembled at the Toyota factory in Princeton, Indiana, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year. That factory currently makes the Highlander, Grand Highlander, and Sienna minivan.

Toyota Expects EV Growth

Company executives are saying they expect slow but steady growth in EV sales in the US, which is actually kind of hopeful, given that Congress and the current failed US president intend to rip up California’s EV waiver, impose additional fees on electric cars, revoke the $7,500 federal tax credit, and eviscerate the production incentives for battery manufacturing provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the US will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.” While EV sales may not be growing as fast in the US as proponents might like, Toyota seems comfortable with the idea that any cars it manufacturers in the US that go unsold will find buyers elsewhere.

Toyota is building battery cells for EVs and PHEVs at its new factory in Liberty, North Carolina, which will have 14 production lines when fully operational — 10 dedicated to cells for EVs and 4 for cells that will go into plug-in hybrid vehicles. The first PHEV production line will be operational in June, with the rest coming online between now and 2034. At full capacity, that factory will be able to churn out 30 GWh of batteries — enough for 800,000 tiny hybrid batteries, 150,000 larger batteries for plug-in hybrids, or 300,000 for battery electric cars.

What is driving Toyota’s newfound interest in cars with batteries is a form of FOMO — fear of missing out as GM, Hyundai/Kia, and maybe Honda flood the zone with battery-powered models of their own. Toyota says it expects the share of battery electric cars in the American market to nearly double by 2030. “BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us. They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

More PHEVs From Toyota

While all this EV goodness is going on, Toyota is also planning to add more plug-in hybrids to its model lineup. Last year, 2.4% of its sales were PHEVs, but the company expects that to climb to 20% of its sales in the US by 2030.

According to a report by CNBC, the first PHEV from Toyota was a Prius model that debuted in 2016, a little known fact most readers will be surprised to learn. PHEVs have often had wimpy battery-only range — sometimes less than 10 miles — but long-range plug-ins are starting to light up the sales charts in China. BYD even has a few models that can drive more than 1300 miles on a combination of battery and internal combustion power. Purists may carp that PHEVs are not real electric cars, and they are right, but if range anxiety is preventing someone from taking the electric car plunge, 1,300 miles ought to calm those jitters.

“We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company’s North American headquarters. “We love the PHEV powertrain. We’re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range. We’re looking at plug-ins across the lineup, and it’s more a function of where can we build them, and what is the product strength versus the competition,” Christ said.

Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, told CNBC, “The growth [in PHEVs] is likely limited due to the expensive dual powertrain cost structure. For those already invested, it may make sense to continue along the path. However, for those who haven’t already made significant investments, it is a large incremental cost that must be balanced.”

S&P Global sees PHEV sales in the US growing from about 2 percent last year to 5 percent by the end of the decade. That is considerably less than Toyota is forecasting. AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects them to stabilize at 3.3% over the coming years. Either Toyota or the chattering classes see the future clearly and will be proven correct in the fullness of time.

PHEV sales for Toyota and Lexus increased by 39% last year, according to company data. “We’re looking across the lineup and saying, ‘How many powertrains can we offer on what products?’” Christ said. “We are going to increase the percentage of hybrids and PHEVs.” We at CleanTechnica have been criticizing Toyota for years for dragging its feet on the transition to battery-powered cars.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's projected $3 billion investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant that is 60% complete and slated to employ 1,700 workers.

""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said at a policy conference of the factory 100 miles (161 km) west of Detroit. ""We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made.""

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026.

The tax-reform bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL 300750.

""I'm spending a lot of time talking about that with politicians. It's a federal issue, but it's also a state issue,"" Ford said on Thursday.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

The company touted a letter from more than 100 Marshall-area business owners, school leaders, elected officials calling on Congress to retain the tax incentives, which noted the area has ""lost thousands of jobs over the past several years.""

The House bill would also end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs.

When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather.
The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.","“Energy security,” the principle that when you flip a light switch the lights will turn on, is something that most Americans take for granted. But the mechanics behind it incorporate both century-old transmission towers and the latest in renewable energy technology.

Last month, we wrote about a suite of energy-focused orders issued by the Trump Administration. Since then, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued three additional orders related to electricity generation or transmission in Puerto Rico (here and here) and Michigan (here) under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (FPA).

These orders aim to ensure grid reliability amidst challenges involving weather, infrastructure, and shifts in energy policy. As we discuss below, while these orders may appear ideological, they are targeted to specific local problems that could cause blackouts.

Resilience in US Generation Policy

Federal and state governments, along with private actors, play crucial roles in US electric generation policymaking. The DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) set national energy policies, while state governments implement local priorities, leading to a diverse energy landscape. Weather impacts both electric demand and infrastructure itself. Federal and state officials share the responsibility to responding to weather events, with federal officials responsible for setting standards for resilience projects, funding initiatives, and coordinating emergency response.

In April, the president issued an Executive Order titled “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,” which expanded the role of the federal government in energy policy. Specifically, it authorized the use of emergency powers to require existing fossil fuel-fired power plants to stay online. Citing its earlier declaration of a “National Energy Emergency,” the Administration preemptively invoked Section 202 of the FPA, which allows FERC to require specific energy generation or facility interconnection to meet energy demands in times of war or emergency. The three orders discussed below are the first the Administration has issued under this authority.

May 16 Puerto Rico Orders

Puerto Rico’s electrical grid faces challenges stemming both from geography (i.e., being a tropical island without fossil fuel resources) as well as history (e.g., underinvestment and weather events, including three hurricanes and major earthquakes in the past decade). In April, following an island-wide blackout, the governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Order EO-2025-016, declaring a state of emergency for Puerto Rico’s electric system.

On May 16, citing Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The first order sets out emergency measures for generation and the second sets out emergency measures for transmission. The orders together compel short-term actions to address well-known risks to the stability of Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

The risks are both recently chronicled and not in dispute. This year, a systems analysis, conducted by Puerto Rican officials, determined that any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power. To minimize potential power losses, DOE ordered that 34 fossil-fuel fired units, some of them mothballed, be made available for 90 days (subject to being extended) to promote grid reliability.

In terms of transmission, DOE’s order also notes that Puerto Rico’s transmission lines are “currently operated with up to 70% derating to avoid failures from infrastructure conditions (e.g. line sagging into vegetation)” and that lack of vegetation control on transmission and distribution rights-of-ways is “one of the main causes of power failures.” Localized transmission failures can cascade into larger issues. Accordingly, DOE ordered PREPA to reestablish rights-of-way by managing vegetation and report back to DOE on its progress in 90 days, with DOE deploying regulatory heft to addressing long-term issues to the Puerto Rico electric grid.

The Michigan Order

A week later, DOE issued an emergency order to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy directing them to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant [set to close on May 31, 2025] is available to operate.” The Campbell plant was rated to produce 1,560 MW of electricity. This order trumps a state order — supported by the facility owner — to shut down the plant.

The Michigan order noted that “[m]ultiple generation facilities in Michigan have retired in recent years” and since “2020, about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity have been retired and no new coal-fired facilities are planned.” Indeed, since the middle of 2024, 1,575 megawatts of capacity were retired. A regulatory assessment issued May 14 forecast an increased potential for regulatory shortfalls. To address these forecasted shortfalls, the order requires that, for a period of 90 days, MISO and Consumers must “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate. For the duration of this order, MISO is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” The essential effect of this order is that the Campbell Plant will continue to operate for at least the next 90 days to better allow DOE to understand whether shutting down the plant will negatively affect the overall electric grid.

What to Watch

We’ve talked a lot about the Administration’s energy deregulation. How do the DOE orders listed above fit within that deregulation scheme? Here are three notable points about how they may be consistent:

1. The Orders are Not Necessarily Ideological

It is easy to see power generation as an ideological issue particularly in light of the Administration’s desire to “Reinvigorate America’s Beautiful Clean Coal.” But, at least in the short term, fossil fuel generation would continue in Puerto Rico as it always has because, according to federal regulators, fossil fuel plants accounted for 93% of Puerto Rico’s generation capacity in 2024, with petroleum-fired power plants themselves accounting for 62%. Rather than encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels, the orders largely seem focused on minimizing blackouts.

2. Local Control of Power Generation Isn’t Ending

The orders likely reflect a cautious approach intended to promote grid stability and likely do not themselves address the transition from fossil fuels. The orders in both states react to local conditions, such as recent grid instability in Puerto Rico and Michigan’s spate of fossil fuel resource retirement. In both locations, the orders are at least nominally consistent with local political realities. The transmission-focused order in Puerto Rico indicates that some of the concerns raised in the order originated at recent meetings with local stakeholders. Puerto Rican government officials reportedly supported the orders. In Michigan, this order followed a May 7 county commission resolution requesting that state regulators postpone the plant’s retirement.

3. The Orders Will Last Longer Than Previous 202(c) Orders

Finally, the FPA 202(c) orders here initially last 90 days with requirements for reporting back to DOE. When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather. (See examples here and here.) During the first Administration DOE entertained (but denied) a request from coal-related generation concerns to keep a number of coal-fired plants running for grid reliability concerns using the same provision.

The Puerto Rico and Michigan orders were issued under FPA Section 202(c) and were intended to address “emergency” situations, rather than FPA Section 202(b), which federal regulators have historically used to improve operational efficiency and reliability of the electric grid under non-emergency conditions. The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 04:00:18.604345

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives.","As of February, Forsyth County has 2,947 registered electric vehicles (EVs) and Guilford County has 4,745, marking year-over-year increases of about 42% and 45%, respectively.

According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), the number of registered EVs in Forsyth and Guilford counties rose from 442 and 799 in February 2020 to 927 and 1,454 in 2022, and further to 2,075 and 3,262 in February 2024.

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Timothy Johnson, professor of the Practice of Energy and the Environment at Duke University, noted that while both counties’ growth rates appear impressive, they still represent an “increase from a relatively small number,” a trend seen across much of the country, except in states like California, where demand is significantly higher.

“You've seen a much greater market share of EVs in other countries — Denmark, and some of the other Nordic countries, as well as China, are going gangbusters on electric vehicles. We're just not seeing that in the U.S.”

In a survey published by EY last year, only 34% of U.S. consumers intending to buy a new vehicle in the next 24 months planned to purchase an EV, marking a 14% decrease from 48% in 2023. A lack of charging stations, limited driving range, battery life and expensive maintenance fees were among the key factors contributing to this decline, as cited by the survey.

How EVs help cut carbon

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has aligned with the president’s pro-coal stance, often promoting his “Drill, baby, drill” slogan and praising Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s calls to keep coal plants active in the country in its social media posts.

Nonetheless, the department’s website emphasizes a different message, stating that using hybrid vehicles and EVs “supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet.”

“The multiple fuel sources used to generate electricity result in a more secure energy source for the electrified portion of the transportation sector,” it adds.

In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper set a statewide goal of reaching 1.25 million registered zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 under Executive Order 246. His earlier goal of reaching 80,000 registered EVs by 2025, outlined in Executive Order 80, was surpassed in November 2023, which Gov. Josh Stein praised the achievement then as a reflection of the state’s commitment to the EV sector.

“Most EVs will automatically reduce life-cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 50% from their gasoline powered counterparts,” said Noah Kittner, an assistant professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The U.S. Department of Energy states that a small electric SUV produces 52% fewer life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline vehicle.

The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States, and greenhouse gases are the key contributors to climate change, driving rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, which impact both the environment and public health, as noted by researchers and scientists around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The biggest environmental benefits of electric vehicles have to do with air quality and pollutant emissions…shifting from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles moves the emissions to power plants, which are far fewer in number, and since they don't move around, they're easier to control,” Johnson said.

Why EVs make economic sense — but policy still lags

Mark Curtis, associate professor and Reynolds Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, explained that EVs are “simply better products than internal combustion cars” from an economic standpoint.

“They are cheaper to own over the life of the car, they require less maintenance, and they perform better,” Curtis said. “They accelerate faster, have fewer parts, and don’t need oil changes or regular engine repairs. For most drivers, especially those who can charge at home, they are already the better option.”

According to a 2020 analysis by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Idaho National Laboratory (INL), drivers can save up to $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years by choosing an electric vehicle instead of a similar gasoline-powered one.

Gas-powered cars, Curtis added, create significant economic costs by negatively impacting people's health and reducing their productivity.

“Yet under current rules, those damages are not priced into the cost of driving,” Curtis said.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives. Instead, Duke Energy offers a one-time rebate of up to $1,133 to help households prepare for at-home EV charging, which Curtis noted as “particularly relevant” in Winston-Salem and Greensboro, where many residents live in single-family homes.

“It’s worth noting that utilities have an interest in encouraging EV charging at certain times because it could actually save the utilities money in terms of grid operational costs and distribution system upgrades,” Kittner said.

Kittner expressed skepticism, however, about North Carolina adopting incentives or rebates, pointing out the recent decision by the N.C. General Assembly to raise the annual registration fee for fully electric vehicles from $140 to $180.

“Recent policies suggest that there may be additional fees levied on EV owners,” he added. “So it seems the current proposals are increasing costs of adoption rather than providing new rebates or incentives.”

What’s at stake in New York?

20,300 jobs lost if clean energy credits are repealed

$3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP by 2032

Up to $650/year in higher energy bills for New Yorkers

Schumer called the proposal “a gut punch to New York and a gift to China,” warning that without U.S. tax credits, clean energy manufacturing will shift overseas.

Clean energy projects in danger

Key programs targeted by the repeal include:

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit – Up to $3,200 for home upgrades

Residential Clean Energy Credit – 30% off solar panels and heat pumps

Clean Electricity Investment Credits – Support for wind, solar, and hydro

Advanced Manufacturing Credits – Driving growth in battery and EV sectors

Electric Vehicle Tax Credits – Lower costs for new and used EVs

Clean Hydrogen Credit – Supporting companies like Plug Power in NY

Real projects, real impact

Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed:

Empire Wind off Long Island drew $5 billion in offshore wind investment

Plug Power added jobs in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region with green hydrogen production

Viridi Parente in Buffalo expanded domestic battery production

Solar Liberty installed panels using federal incentives

GE Vernova added a wind turbine line, creating 200 jobs in Schenectady

Schumer said the rollback would not only shutter these projects but also stall America’s energy independence.

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

“Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.” Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.
The Trump administration has been quick to disregard climate change and has moved against initiatives aimed at combating it.","In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother’s fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car’s air conditioning wasn’t working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday’s filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.”

Chevron Corporation counsel Theodore Boutrous Jr. said in a statement: “Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense. The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.”

ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about the specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.”

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming. Recently, Hawaii and Michigan announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, though the states have been met by counter lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department.

The Trump administration has been quick to disregard climate change and has moved against initiatives aimed at combating it. The U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change. And the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company’s greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Looking ahead, it’s hard to imagine this will be an isolated incident,” said Don Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School. “We’re facing an escalating climate crisis. It’s a sobering thought that this year, the hottest on record, will almost certainly be one of the coolest we’ll experience for the foreseeable future.

“It is predictable or — to use a legal term, foreseeable — that the loss of life from these climate-fueled disasters will likely accelerate as climate chaos intensifies,” he added. “At the heart of all this is the argument about the culpability of fossil fuel companies, and it rests on a large and growing body of evidence that these companies have understood the dangers of their products for decades.”

“The university is aligning its future development plans with the vision laid out in Rio Grande District Plan.
The Salt Lake City Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) is leading the larger Rio Grande Plan, for which the U land is a critical component.
The plan calls for a complete makeover of the land encircling the Utah Transit Authority’s Salt Lake Central Station just west of the historic depot.
Remediating the contamination on the university property will make it so their site can be incorporated into the implementation of this vision for the Rio Grande District,” Lindsley said.","University officials have secured a $2 million federal grant to clean up a contaminated 2-acre plot in Salt Lake City’s Rio Grande District, bringing much-needed funds to kickstart the revitalization of a blighted part of downtown.

The money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s brownfield remediation program, designed to help bring distressed, but otherwise valuable real estate back into use.

“This area has long been an industrial railroad corridor and it’s exciting to play a role in its revitalization,” said Isabeau Tavo, the University of Utah’s deputy director of real estate development, at a press event Thursday outside the historic Rio Grande Depot. “The university is aligning its future development plans with the vision laid out in Rio Grande District Plan. The vision transforms the heart of the district into a vibrant innovation hub.”

Joining U officials at the announcement were officials with the city, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and EPA Regional Director Cyrus Western. The award is part of the $267 million in brownfields grants announced nationally by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“Projects like this are just one chapter of this city and of this basin,” said Western, until recently a Wyoming lawmaker. “Someone could drive through here and come to the conclusion this space isn’t worth much, there’s no potential here, there’s nothing that can be done here. But these brownfield projects are a good example of when we have local partners, we can in fact turn it into something that is incredible.”

The University of Utah Research Foundation acquired the land in 2021 in the form of seven adjacent parcels along 400 South at 550 West, about one block southwest of the historic Rio Grande Depot, the architectural anchor of the ambitious redevelopment project targeting 20 blighted acres on the west side of downtown.

Redevelopment of the land stalled over the need to remove hazardous materials, such as arsenic and volatile organic compounds, permeating the ground, the legacy of myriad industrial uses dating back to 1911. All the buildings have been razed since the U bought the land for $6.8 million and only foundations and weeds remain.

The Salt Lake City Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) is leading the larger Rio Grande Plan, for which the U land is a critical component. The plan calls for a complete makeover of the land encircling the Utah Transit Authority’s Salt Lake Central Station just west of the historic depot.

“We are tying to capitalize on our access to transit to make this walkable and bikable and sustainable and have a great place with a lot of active uses that will bring the district to life,” said Cara Lindsley, the CRA’s deputy director. “The plan calls for breaking up our large city blocks into a more walkable scale. By doing this we create safe and comfortable connections. When this is fully realized this will really be a memorable destination.”

However, little of this vision can be accomplished without support from landowners along with state and federal agencies.

“There are unique challenges to redevelopment before land can be returned to productive use and these challenges often require multiple partners come to the table. Remediating the contamination on the university property will make it so their site can be incorporated into the implementation of this vision for the Rio Grande District,” Lindsley said. “The impact of the EPA’s and university’s investment in this district can’t be overstated.”

The total cost of the cleanup is expect to exceed the EPA grant by up to $1.5 million, which will be covered by the U. That work will entail a combination of removing contaminated soil and treating the rest in situ with chemicals that would render the contaminants harmless, according to Michael Brehm, an engineer with the U’s Environmental Health & Safety Department. The goal is to bring the ground up to environmental standards for commercial use, but not for residential use, which would be cost prohibitive.

Western praised the city and the university for making the leap to transform a blighted, but once vital part of Salt Lake City into a place that will spur economic growth and the city’s renewal.

“It’s an inspiring story. For every dollar of funding we put into projects like this it creates $20 of community impact,” he said. “It tells the story that with a little initiative and a little bit of public funding we can unlock the secret sauce of all the private dollars coming in to take it from what it is now to what it can be.”

On May 22, House Republicans passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” under the budget reconciliation process. This marks a significant milestone in the effort to pass tax legislation by the July 4 holiday, a self-prescribed deadline set by the Republicans and White House administration. The tax bill will now move to the Senate, which is back in session on June 2.

The primary goal of the tax bill is to extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill, just as with the TCJA in 2017. Under reconciliation, only a simple majority is needed in the Senate for the bill to become law. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax bill as passed by the House would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Although it is anticipated that Senate Republicans will make several changes and tweaks to the tax bill in the upcoming weeks, critical provisions in the House version are outlined below:

Businesses and Investors

Qualified business income deduction (Section 199A) – Increases maximum deduction from 20% to 23% and makes the deduction permanent

Depreciation/expensing – Provides 100% bonus depreciation for certain property acquired between January 20, 2025, and 2029 and increases Section 179 expensing limitation from $1 million to $2.5 million

Research and development expenditures – Return to immediate expensing for domestic (but not foreign) R&D expenditures for tax years 2025 through 2029

Opportunity zones – Renews the opportunity zone program for tax years 2027 through 2033 with modifications to eligibility

Business interest – Reinstates the use of EBITDA (instead of EBIT) when determining the limitation on deducting interest for tax years 2025 through 2029

Excess business losses – Makes permanent the limitations for noncorporate taxpayers ($626,000 for joint filers and $313,000 for single filers for 2025) on deducting excess business losses

Professional sports – Limits the amount eligible for 15-year amortization of the intangible assets of professional sports franchises to 50% of the adjusted tax basis of those assets

Individuals and Estate Planning

Tax rates – Makes permanent the reduced maximum 37% federal income tax rate on ordinary income for individuals

SALT cap – Increases the deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 ($20,000 for married filing separately) with a phase-out for taxpayers earning more than $500,000 in earnings and curbs the use of state PTE tax elections designed to mitigate the SALT cap

Estate and gift tax exemption – Increases exemption to inflation-adjusted $15 million starting in 2026

Standard deduction – Makes permanent the increased standard deduction enacted by the TCJA and temporarily increases the deduction to $26,000 ($13,000 for single filers) for tax years 2025 through 2028

Tips and overtime – Establishes deductions for tips and overtime for certain taxpayers, effectively excluding tips and overtime from federal income taxation (but not payroll taxation), for tax years 2025 through 2028

MAGA accounts – Creates “money account for growth and advancement” trust accounts for U.S. citizens under 18 years old where funds can be used for qualified expenses such as higher education

Clean Energy and Renewables Industry

Electric vehicles – Repeals tax credits related to electric vehicles starting in 2026 but retains a limited tax credit for electric vehicles from certain manufacturers that have produced fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles

Clean electricity production and investment tax credits – Accelerates phasing out these credits (Section 45Y and Section 48E) starting after 2028 and changes eligibility from when facilities begin construction to when they enter service

Clean hydrogen – Repeals the clean hydrogen production tax credit (Section 45V) for projects beginning after 2025

Residential solar – Eliminates production and investment tax credits for many solar facilities that are leased to homeowners

Selling tax credits – Eliminates the ability to sell many tax credits after 2027

EVs accounted for 1.3 million vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.
Toyota's Coming EV Lineup Sounds Good To keep up with that growing demand, there will be a lineup of seven fully electric vehicles offered in the U.S. by 2027 between Toyota and Lexus.
Those will stick around indefinitely, and Toyota will introduce the bZ Woodland version, and the recently-revealed C-HR EV to the U.S., both in the coming year.
That means Toyota is looking into exporting those two new EVs it'll produce stateside to other markets.","Toyota made a promise a few years ago to have an electrified version of each model in its lineup - either hybrid or fully electric - by the end of 2025, and it's on track to meet that goal. It's paying off, as around 80% of sales between Toyota and Lexus are already electrified in some way, so it's only going to improve, thanks in no small part to cars like the Prius and Camry.

Now, the automaker projects EV sales in the U.S. will likely double by the end of the decade, and it has plans to introduce plenty of new products to keep up - a major reversal of the position it was peddling just a few short years ago, where some executives claimed the shift to electric vehicles was overhyped.

The State Of Electrified Toyota Right Now

Sales of Toyota's hybrids are skyrocketing, helped by the fact that the Prius looks good now, the Camry lineup has gone completely electrified as hybrids, and the RAV4 will follow suit with a fresh lineup of hybrids for its updated model year. However, the Japanese automaker only sold around 30,000 EVs in the U.S. in 2024, which is far below its typical sales expectations for traditional vehicles that range in the hundreds of thousands.

Still, the company believes EVs are the future, and that the share of EV sales in the U.S. is likely to double in the next five years. EVs accounted for 1.3 million vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.

Toyota's Coming EV Lineup Sounds Good

To keep up with that growing demand, there will be a lineup of seven fully electric vehicles offered in the U.S. by 2027 between Toyota and Lexus. Currently, there's the recently-renamed Toyota bZ SUV on offer, and its related Lexus RZ SUV. Those will stick around indefinitely, and Toyota will introduce the bZ Woodland version, and the recently-revealed C-HR EV to the U.S., both in the coming year. By 2027, we should expect an all-electric trim of the lovely new Lexus ES, joined by two new EVs that will be produced stateside.

Toyota's American Production Is Growing

Toyota's Georgetown, Kentucky, plant will get one of the still-mysterious EVs, and another will be assembled at the company's Princeton, Indiana, facility. Toyota also has a Liberty, North Carolina battery facility that will eventually have the capacity to turn out 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries for new models, though that will be less, as the plant capacity is split to also produce hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle batteries, as well.

In an interview with Bloomberg, senior VP Cooper Ericksen at Toyota said: ""We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market. But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations."" That means Toyota is looking into exporting those two new EVs it'll produce stateside to other markets.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2026-toyota-bz-woodland-8.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 21:01:01.653765

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
“Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.""
Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.
The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon.","In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother's fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car's air conditioning wasn't working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company. ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday's filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.""

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.""

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming. Recently, Hawaii and Michigan announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, though the states have been met by counter lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department.

The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, again; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change; and the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company's greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Looking ahead, it’s hard to imagine this will be an isolated incident,” said Don Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School. ""We’re facing an escalating climate crisis. It’s a sobering thought that this year, the hottest on record, will almost certainly be one of the coolest we’ll experience for the foreseeable future.

“It is predictable or — to use a legal term, foreseeable — that the loss of life from these climate-fueled disasters will likely accelerate as climate chaos intensifies,” he added. “At the heart of all this is the argument about the culpability of fossil fuel companies, and it rests on a large and growing body of evidence that these companies have understood the dangers of their products for decades.”

The bill, SB 0041, was introduced in January and has since been referred to the Senate Assignments Committee and the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee.

The proposed clean transportation standard would take the form of a credit marketplace monitored by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Airline, rail, ocean-going and military fuel would be exempt from the program.

The legislation directs state agencies to propose and adopt rules to establish the CTS within 24 months of the bill being signed into law. The program would initially required a 25% CI reduction over 10 years when compared to a 2019 baseline. Further reductions would be required over the following decade.

In calculating CI reductions, the program would recognize farm emissions reductions that contributed to the reduced CI of fuels by allowing credit generators to use individualized farm-level CI scoring for approved sustainable agricultural practices and requiring the state agencies to use the U.S. Department of Energy GREET models’ feedstock carbon intercity calculator to determine individualized farm-level CI scoring.

The bill also includes provisions implementing a price cap on compliance credits designed to contain costs if fuel supply forecasts determine that not enough credits would be available. The credit price cap would be adjusted annually for inflation.

A full copy of the bill is available on the Illinois legislature website.

Since Schumer led the Inflation Reduction Act to passage three years ago, companies announced plans to invest $843 billion in projects, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. Leader Schumer warns the GOP plans to deliver a fatal blow to America’s domestic clean energy and manufacturing economy and working families – at the behest of Big Oil and billionaires – and says the Republican plan must be stopped.

Today, standing at the largest rooftop solar array in Manhattan, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) warned that the GOP’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” would decimate clean energy, kill over 800,00 jobs, and raise costs for American families, according to Energy Innovation. With the goal of funding tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, the House-passed bill would eliminate clean energy tax credits, which would cut hundreds of thousands of clean energy and manufacturing jobs, and millions of related jobs. Schumer also said the tax hikes on clean energy this bill are expected to drive up monthly energy bills by almost 10% across the country, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association. Schumer sounded the alarm and warned the GOP to back off this disastrous plan to bow to Big Oil billionaires.

“This so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America’s clean energy economy and a huge amount jobs across the country,” said Leader Schumer. “It’s a job-killer, a cost-raiser, and a giveaway to Big Oil billionaires — all at the expense of workers, and American families. That is why the GOP plan to deliver a tax cut to billionaires at the expense of lower bills and cleaner energy for all must be stopped.”

Three years ago, Leader Schumer spear-headed the Inflation Reduction Act, leading its passaging through the Senate and into law. In just this short time, the clean energy tax credits have revolutionized America’s clean energy economy and has already created over 400,000 jobs, according to Climate Power. These incentives make it cheaper to provide more clean electricity, for families to make their homes more energy efficient and lower their energy bills, and to manufacture critical and desperately needed energy components, like batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines in the United States. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, companies have announced over $843 billion in investments in clean energy projects, with millions of good-paying jobs slated to be created across the country, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. The repeal of these incentives would vaporize thousands of jobs and jeopardize the nation’s path to energy independence.

“If Republicans succeed in gutting these tax credits, it will mean higher monthly energy bills for families and small businesses, fewer jobs for hardworking Americans, and a dangerous step backward in innovation on energy,” Schumer added. “It’s a big win for China and a big loss for American manufacturing. It means less energy diversity and higher costs for consumers and businesses.”

Additionally, study after study shows that the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy will raise costs for families and small businesses. One conservative study from the Clean Energy Buyers Association showed that small businesses in America will see a 10% increase in electricity prices next year, a cost that’s likely to be passed straight onto consumers. With the average small business spending $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the Department of Energy, the Republican plan will spell disaster for main street businesses and families across the country.

If the GOP plan to raise taxes on clean energy goes through and American projects are halted, experts fear it could help American adversaries like China solidify dominance in low-cost, clean energy manufacturing. This would make the United States more reliant on other countries for cheap energy, reduce American production of energy technology like solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and disrupt American supply chains while sending American jobs overseas.

The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the country has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, responsible for 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule.
But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in level of polluting power plant emissions.
The site of the plant, the last of the utility's nuclear power facilities, was then set to be cleared.
Michigan utility regulators termed the federal order ""unnecessary” and noted no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region.","The Trump administration has taken several new actions in recent days, some with little public notice, to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S, particularly from coal-fired plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waited until Saturday, May 24 to confirm to media, only after a New York Times report, that it is drafting a proposed regulation to eliminate all current restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants. The report is based on sources and review of internal documents.

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters. ""As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule."" The proposal is set to be published in the Federal Register after White House and federal agencies' review, possibly in June, the spokesperson said.. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had said in a previous statemen that the agency is “seeking to ensure [EPA] follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.”

The draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other plant greenhouse gases “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, according to the Times report, and that cutting emissions would have no ""meaningful effect"" on public health. The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the country has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, responsible for 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule.

But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in level of polluting power plant emissions.

EPA released no further details from the draft rule, said the Times, also speculating it could be finalized by the end of the year, “an extraordinarily fast pace.”

Supporters are optimistic but other observers expect the rule to face lawsuits if it becomes final and remain concerned it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.

""It is a good step forward in line with the rule of law,"" Thomas Pyle, president of oil and gas advocacy group American Energy Alliance, told the Washington Post.

But Vickie Patton, Environmental Defense Fund general counsel said ""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" calling the proposed rule “an abuse of [EPA] responsibility under the law. ... that flies in the face of common sense.""

'Emergency Order'

The EPA confirmation followed by one day an ‘emergency order” from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright that directs grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Michigan utility Consumers Energy, to ensure that the 1.56-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., ""remains available for operation,"" noting its planned shutdown on May 31, which DOE said ""is 15 years before the end of its scheduled design life.""

The plant's three units were built in 1962, 1967 and 1980. The site of the plant, the last of the utility's nuclear power facilities, was then set to be cleared.

Wright said the closure reversal, now set to last until Aug. 21, is authorized under the Federal Power Act and ""is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency.""

Michigan utility regulators termed the federal order ""unnecessary” and noted no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region. Katie Carey, a Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement said, the utiity ""plans to comply with the 90-day pause. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company.”

The utility had announced in February an agreement with Ashcor USA Inc., a unit of ATCO Ltd., to extract and repurpose millions of tons of impounded coal ash from the J.H. Campbell site to be made into a high-grade cement substitute.

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration moved on May 22 to support a lawsuit by Texas and 12 other states against large private infrastructure investors Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advsors that claims they conspired to reduce competition in the U.S. coal sector that risks undermining the federal goal of domestic energy independence. The U.S. Justice Dept. and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case that State Street called “baseless.”

President Donald Trump also signed four executive orders to propel a faster buildout of U.S. nuclear power plants, including a directive for the Energy and Defense Departments to construct reactors at military bases, on federal lands and sited near data centers.

The orders also seek strategies for how reactors could be constructed without approval of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and sets a goal to increase U.S. nuclear power generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up fourfold from the current 100 GW level that is the putput of more than than 90 operating reactors.

The Tennessee Valley Authority last month submitted to the agency the first portion of a construction permit application to build a GE Hitachi BWRX-300 small modular reactor at its Clinch River nuclear site in Oak Ridge, Tenn. If built, the Clinch River unit will serve as a flagship for U.S. commercial deployment of the SMR design,

“The application is essentially the blueprint for the plant’s design and safety systems, and the NRC must approve the plans before construction could begin,” TVA said, noting that it will submit the full construction permit application by the end of June.

TVA has contracted Bechtel, Sargent & Lundy and GE Hitachi as its team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1, the companies said. GE Hitachi is the designer of the BWRX-300 system.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/05/29/CAMPBELL-COALPLANTCONSUMERS-ENERGY.jpg?height=635&t=1748556788&width=1200,N,,2025-05-29 20:07:09.703897

Production of two American-made all-electric models is slated to begin next year, joining three new imported EVs Toyota aims to have in U.S. showrooms in the coming months and two currently available. By mid-2027, a total of seven EVs will be showing up in its U.S. dealerships.

The new battery-powered cars will help fulfill the company’s pledge to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year. So far, just under 80% of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the United States offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Toyota typically doesn’t add a model to a plant unless it’s confident it can sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production fully ramps up. Company executives say they expect slow but steady growth in U.S. EV sales. At the same time, faster adoption in overseas markets offers an outlet for any U.S. production in excess of domestic demand.

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.”

That’s assuming President’s Donald Trump’s tariffs don’t upend the U.S. auto market and spur a retaliatory trade war.

The Japanese automaker is on track to start shipping lithium-ion batteries later this year from a massive plant in the rural town of Liberty, North Carolina, that sprawls over 1,850 acres. Of that facility’s 14 production lines, 10 are dedicated to electric vehicle battery cells, with the remainder going to hybrid batteries.

It will supply cells earmarked for use in the two U.S.-made EVs.

The battery factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to be operational next month and the others will be brought online through 2034, the company said. It aims for production greater than 30 gigawatt hours at full capacity, or the equivalent of 800,000 hybrid, 150,000 plug-in hybrid and 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries.

Total EV sales rose 7.3% in the United States last year to some 1.3 million vehicles, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelly Blue Book. But Toyota delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the United States in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics skyrocketed.

The Japanese carmaker has been slower to jump on the EV bandwagon than most of its global rivals. It emerged as one of the biggest critics of policies designed to hasten EV adoption in the United States and has called on American policymakers to allow the market to dictate demand.

But Toyota is also reluctant to cede a market currently representing about 8% of U.S. sales to rivals such as General Motors Co., Tesla Inc., and Hyundai Motor Co. The company expects battery electrics’ share of the American market to nearly double by 2030.

“BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us; They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

In addition to the all-electric bZ4X — which soon will be renamed the bZ — and Lexus RZ that it sells now, Toyota will add three more import EV models next year: The bZ Woodland, CH-R crossover and a version of the Lexus ES sedan.

Toyota’s factory in Georgetown, Kentucky — its largest plant globally - currently manufactures some 550,000 vehicles annually, including top-selling models such as the RAV4 small SUV, Camry sedan and Lexus ES. The Camry went all-hybrid last year and the RAV4 will stop offering a gasoline-only version in its next model year. Toyota hasn’t disclosed the name of the all-electric model that will made there.

Similarly, it hasn’t provided details about the EV that will join larger models such as its Highlander SUV, Grand Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan that are made at its Princeton, Indiana, factory, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PDTN/83923544007-toyotabg-vcmqzasuvjav-5-oitwn-2-tnebiwq.jpg?crop=3861,2174,x6,y284&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 01:02:04.422083

Ford's Marshall battery plant has faced scrutiny for its ties to a Chinese company and has already seen reduced incentives due to lowered production expectations.

Ford Motor Co. Executive Chair Bill Ford, speaking at the Mackinac Policy Conference, sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford Motor's investment in a Marshall plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said on May 29.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The Senate still must deal with the bill, which Democrats oppose and has drawn criticism from some fiscally conservative senators.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles.

A Plan to Kill American Clean Energy The budget bill passed by the House sends a wrecking ball straight at the US clean energy industry behind this success.
In a nutshell, the bill effectively repeals many of the IRA incentives for wind and solar power, clean technology manufacturing, and electric vehicles.
One Big Beautiful Bill = Higher Energy Bills Regardless of where Americans personally stand on clean energy, most will feel the impact of repeal right away in their energy bills.","There is no world where raising cumulative annual energy costs in the US by a staggering $16 billion this decade and killing some 830,000 jobs is a good idea.

But that’s exactly what the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that recently passed the US House of Representatives would do, according to analysis of the bill’s initial text from Energy Innovation. (And that was before lawmakers added deeper cuts to clean energy programs.)

The bill is now in the hands of the Senate where concerns about the impact of repealing clean energy programs are just one point in a long list of objections.

Take action: Tell the Senate to protect clean energy investments cutting costs and climate pollution.

While there is hope the Senate will blunt the all-out assault of the House text, it would be a mistake to assume senators’ concerns will translate into a fundamentally different bill. After all, 21 members of the House made a splash earlier in the process with a much-publicized letter of support for clean energy initiatives. Only for every one of these members to ultimately vote to repeal them. (At least every member able to stay awake.)

Why is Congress Messing with Success?

The real head-scratcher here is why clean energy programs are even on the chopping block in the first place.

Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, clean energy incentives and credits had helped advance over 400,000 jobs and $441 billion in investments across 49 states and Puerto Rico through the end of 2024, according to Climate Power. By any political measure, that’s an incredible success story.

But even for the millions of Americans working in entirely different sectors and living miles away from all the battery and electric vehicle factories sprouting up across the Southeast, clean energy programs have been critical in one very important way: helping hold energy prices down. Not just in the near term either, but also, according to testimony from Center for American Progress (CAP), by shifting the direction of travel of the entire US economy toward more and more cheap renewable energy.

What this means, as the CAP report notes, is that prior to the House budget bill, “household energy costs are on course to drop by one-third by 2035, an annual savings of roughly $2,000 per household.”

Why? The answer is pretty simple: Regardless of where you stand on climate, average electricity costs from clean energy are just cheaper than fossil energy pretty much everywhere.

What this means is that the best way to keep power bills affordable is to add more wind and solar to the electrical grid. (Even accounting for calm days and evenings.)

The cost question becomes even more urgent at a time when demand for electricity is skyrocketing from power-hungry data centers and other users, threatening to boost consumer bills by as much as 70% by 2029.

So far, solar, wind, and battery storage have been instrumental in meeting this moment, providing an incredible 93% of new energy capacity in 2024. So while the fossil fuel industry talks about “energy realism,” the reality is that clean energy – not coal, oil, and gas – is helping the US quickly add new energy to the grid while keeping costs down.

Why mess with that?

A Plan to Kill American Clean Energy

The budget bill passed by the House sends a wrecking ball straight at the US clean energy industry behind this success.

In a nutshell, the bill effectively repeals many of the IRA incentives for wind and solar power, clean technology manufacturing, and electric vehicles.

In its current form, the bill ends the popular credits for new and used electric vehicles for most models at the end of 2025 (and adds a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers).

Credits to help homeowners install solar, heat pumps, and other clean technologies also sunset at the end of this year.

And if that wasn’t enough, the bill also ends advanced manufacturing credits in 2031 for companies investing in US factories to build batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy components while making the credits largely unworkable in the interim

On the generation side, the bill adds such https://www.utilitydive.com/news/inflation-reduction-act-ira-deadline-sixty-days-construction-project-trump/748892/ and short project timelines for renewables – requiring for example, that projects begin construction within 60 daysthe end of 2028 – that few developers will likely be able to use them, including for projects already in progress.

The verdict from Wall Street was immediate. Solar stocks plunged after the House bill passed. One headline spoke of a “nightmare scenario” for the clean energy industry.

Even before the bill’s text was released, major manufacturers who’d invested billions in US factories to feed clean tech demand were warning what repeal of these credits would mean.

As Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February, “We've already sunk capital – even though we've rationalized it – in battery production and assembly plants all through Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. And many of those jobs will be at risk if the IRA is repealed.""

It’s not just major corporations concerned.

For months, Sugar Hollow Solar in Asheville, North Carolina has been working to get back on its feet, after biblical floods unleashed by Hurricane Helene swallowed the company warehouse and over $1 million of equipment. Now the budget bill threatens to erase all that progress and worse.

“After everything our community has been through – especially with the loss of our warehouse during Hurricane Helene – it’s upsetting to see legislation that would take us backward just when we need momentum the most, Doug Ager, Sugar Hollow’s founder and CEO said, “These tax credits don’t just power homes; they help rebuild lives, create jobs, and give families and small businesses like ours a chance to help in the clean energy transition.”

It's a sentiment echoed over and over all across the nation as clean energy companies grapple with this existential threat to their business, with potentially catastrophic effects for workers and the communities that depend on them. All so the wealthiest Americans can get yet another tax break.

One Big Beautiful Bill = Higher Energy Bills

Regardless of where Americans personally stand on clean energy, most will feel the impact of repeal right away in their energy bills.

As the CEO of one of the country’s largest utilities, John Ketchum of NextEra Energy, recently said in an interview with the New York Times, “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

How high is the moon? As analysis from Energy Innovation shows, the bill as introduced would lead total annual consumer energy prices to rise by a staggering $16 billion by 2030.

One of the reasons why is the bill creates a whole series of knock-on effects. For one, removing incentives for affordable clean energy means we’ll likely see less new power come online while demand rises, increasing electricity prices and jeopardizing basic reliability.

Alongside what happens in the power sector, writ large, killing these incentives

effectively pushes consumers from clean electric power and technologies (cheap and relatively stable in price) to more fossil fuel alternatives (often more expensive and volatile in price). With fewer Americans driving electric vehicles and installing heat pumps, for example, demand for oil for internal combustion engine vehicles and natural gas for home heating goes up, pushing prices up across the board.

If there is a silver lining in the budget process, it’s that the bill is not a done deal. The Senate now gets a say on what it wants and the full House will have to vote again on the results before anything heads to the president’s desk. Each vote is a chance for Americans to speak up and pressure lawmakers to protect the clean energy investments and programs putting people to work and keeping costs down for all of us. The stakes couldn’t be higher – and it’s up to us to keep the pressure on.",https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/colin-lloyd-UfsxZ-A8bDA-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 21:00:54.766415

There are many bad elements to the Republican extension of tax cuts for the rich. The plan is to sort of, but not really, pay for the tax cuts by cutting healthcare for millions, food assistance for the hungriest Americans, and harming veterans.

One of the areas that hasn’t been discussed enough is that this legislation also kills jobs, especially in the clean energy sector.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has released some data on how much damage the clean energy portion of the Republican tax cuts for the rich will cause:

Study after study shows that the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy will raise costs for families and small businesses. One conservative study from the Clean Energy Buyers Association showed that small businesses in America will see a 10% increase in electricity prices next year, a cost that’s likely to be passed straight onto consumers. With the average small business spending $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the Department of Energy, the Republican plan will spell disaster for main street businesses and families across the country.

If the GOP plan to raise taxes on clean energy goes through and American projects are halted, experts fear it could help American adversaries like China solidify dominance in low-cost, clean energy manufacturing. This would make the United States more reliant on other countries for cheap energy, reduce American production of energy technology like solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and disrupt American supply chains while sending American jobs overseas.

What’s at stake for our Country:

More than $800 Billion in investment at risk: Since the IRA passed, companies have committed billions to building clean energy and clean manufacturing in America, including in batteries, solar, and other advanced technologies

790,000 jobs on the line: These jobs are supported by clean energy tax credits and grant programs that the GOP now seeks to repeal.

Higher energy bills: Repealing the IRA would increase electricity costs and drive up everyday costs for American families and businesses, costing them hundreds of dollars more every year while also reducing access to home efficiency upgrades and energy-saving technologies.

Reduced U.S. energy independence: The tax credits under threat are central to building a domestic supply chain for batteries, solar, and clean power — all of which reduce dependence on foreign energy.

Hakeem Jeffries said on Thursday that Democrats will do everything in their power to stop this bill, but Democrats also need the American people to pressure Republican Senators to kill some of the worst portions of the House-passed legislation.

The House-passed bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices, and make China stronger.

Speaker Mike Johnson is spreading lies and falsehoods, including fantasies of economic growth, that decades of studies have revealed are unfounded. The tax cuts don’t cause economic growth, and tax cuts for the rich don’t trickle down.

The Republican passed House bill is a disaster. It will kill the sort of good jobs that Joe Biden and Democrats worked to create.

The special interest servicing Republican bill needs to be exposed, as the American people must reject this failed legislation.

Reporting from San Francisco

US green fuel company HIF Global has a big vision for Texas's Matagorda County: a $7bn (£5.2bn) commercial scale e-methanol factory to supply the world market.

The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy.

Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way.

But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.

The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.

A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.

The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.

""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.""

Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.

Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).

Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy.

""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.""

Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.

Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.

""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.

What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.

It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.

Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.

Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.

That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.

But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.

The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.

""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.

There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.

More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Tariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.

Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.

The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could ""meet the urgent moment of climate change"". It now focusses on its potential to ""harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks"".

SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be ""relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with"" makes sense.

The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.

""It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,"" says Mr Samartzis.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2b61/live/52a048b0-3bb9-11f0-a20d-1b53273f2a3b.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 22:07:19.878156

A lower court ruled the government’s review was inadequate because it did not fully consider the impacts of increased oil production and refining that could occur as a result of the railway project. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, disagreed.

“When the effects of an agency action arise from a separate project—for example, a possible future project or one that is geographically distinct from the project at hand—NEPA does not require the agency to evaluate the effects of that separate project,” he wrote.

The opinion also reins in the power of federal courts to block projects along similar grounds.

Now, Gov. Tina Kotek and the newly established Oregon Environmental Restoration Council will begin planning, investing and distributing that settlement money – $698 million – over the course of 50 years, using it to pay for environmental restoration and cleanup work across the state. Kotek announced the council’s chairs Wednesday, as well as details about how the money in the state’s Environmental Restoration Fund will eventually be allocated.

“The term ‘once-in-a-generation opportunity’ can be a little bit hyperbolic, but I think in this case, it’s absolutely true,” said Nicole Maness, manager of the fund. “This is a significant amount of money, and it’s coming at a time when there’s a huge amount of uncertainty around federal funding for restoration.”

The settlement money will be invested by the State Treasury, and earn interest income that will be distributed by the Environmental Restoration Council and the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board biennially, Maness said.

Half of the settlement money awarded each biennium will go to state agencies to support work on water and environmental restoration. One quarter will go to the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon for conservation and natural resources; and the remaining quarter will go to local communities and community-based organizations for projects benefitting people and neighborhoods disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The settlement

The deal between the Oregon Department of Justice and Monsanto is the largest environmental damages settlement in state history. The company agreed to pay in December 2022 to end a lawsuit brought by then Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum over allegations that Monsanto had for decades polluted state waters with Polychlorinated biphenyls, also called PCBs. Oregon is among several states that have sued the company, which has not admitted guilt or liability for the pollution.

Monsanto was for decades the only manufacturer, seller and distributor of PCBs — colorless or light yellow compounds once used in coolants, electrical equipment, hydraulic oils, paints and caulking and copy paper — until it voluntarily ceased production of the compounds in 1977. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found the compounds can cause cancer in animals, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency says they are likely human carcinogens. PCBs continue to leach from landfills and travel into ground and surface waters where they are difficult to remove.

More than a dozen waterways in Oregon are damaged by PCBs, including the Portland Harbor, Lower Columbia River, Middle Columbia River, Willamette River, Upper and Lower John Day Rivers and Coos Bay.

The money will be used for more than just trying to tackle PCB pollution, Maness said, and “in a way that is going to be meaningful to Oregonians, that is going to strike that balance between addressing past harms, but also opportunities to restore places that are important to people, important to wildlife.”

These could include removing barriers to fish passage, improving overall water quality and aquatic habitat and ensuring salmon consumed among many tribes in Oregon are abundant and safe to eat, she said.

The council

Kotek on Wednesday announced she appointed Chuck Sams, an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the former director of the National Park Service, and Michael Dembrow, former Democratic state senator representing Portland, as co-chairs of the council. She also appointed Vice Chair Cheyenne Holliday, advocacy director at the nonprofit Portland-based environmental and social justice group Verde.

“This is a tremendous opportunity for us to improve the health and living conditions of Oregonians in every part of the state, year after year for the next fifty years at least,” Dembrow said in a news release. “It’s especially important to have this stable source of funding right now, given our uncertain state budget and little hope for federal support for this important work.”

The rest of the council will be made up of the directors, or a designee of the directors, of the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality; Oregon’s attorney general or someone from the Office of the Attorney General; and two non-voting members from the Oregon House of Representatives and the Oregon Senate, chosen by those chambers.

Kotek has yet to pick the final two members of the 11-member council she gets to appoint, but Maness said they will have to possess expertise in either PCBs or a wide range of environmental toxins.

The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law.
The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8317x4678+0+433/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2F55%2Feac38c634803b2060366450cb105%2Fgettyimages-1260960662-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 20:07:12.330603

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford on Thursday sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said at a policy conference in the state.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The tax-reform bill passed by the House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology. Ford’s factory, now under construction, would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant in 2023, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

It’s clear that protecting clean energy tax credits would be a huge boost to Florida’s economy over the next decade.
The evidence is clear: Clean energy tax credits are working for Florida.","By Bella Kubach, Citizens’ Climate Lobby

On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Florida if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in the Sunshine State. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Florida has benefited from $603 million in clean energy and transportation investments, 2,500 new jobs and 123 new clean energy and transportation facilities.

Though the tax credits that spurred this were passed by Democrats, they have overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts – 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Florida, where Florida Power and Light (FPL) and JinkoSolar have announced major investments thanks to the tax incentives.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Florida ratepayers will face electricity prices that are almost 10% higher in the coming years.

Florida installed the second-most solar power capacity in the country in 2024 and is on track to become the top-ranked residential solar state in 2028. That success will stall if the proposed rollbacks make their way to the president’s desk.

It will be a real blow to Florida residents who have been using tax credits to make rooftop solar affordable and cut their energy bills. Not only do these incentives make it easier for homeowners to install solar panels and save money, they also help stabilize our power grid.

Long-term projects that have increased production capacity and created hundreds of jobs, such as JinkoSolar’s expanded solar module plant in Jacksonville, were bolstered by tax incentives.

FPL has a “30-by-30” initiative that aims to install over 30 million solar panels by 2030, totaling more than 11,000 megawatts of solar energy generation across the state. It relies heavily on federal tax credits. Those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts. Manufacturing will slow without them.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.” Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody must join the effort to protect them.

It’s clear that protecting clean energy tax credits would be a huge boost to Florida’s economy over the next decade. An analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will spur an estimated $36 billion economic boost and support 57,200 full-time jobs in Florida annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Florida residents.

Florida is making great progress toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

The evidence is clear: Clean energy tax credits are working for Florida. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Sens. Scott and Moody to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

Toyota Motor Corp. is betting Americans are ready for more U.S.-made electric vehicles. And if they aren’t, it has a plan: exports.

Production of two American-made all-electric models is slated to begin next year, joining three new imported EVs Toyota aims to have in U.S. showrooms in the coming months and two currently available. By mid-2027, a total of seven EVs will be showing up in its U.S. dealerships.

The new battery-powered cars will help fulfill the company’s pledge to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year. So far, just under 80% of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the U.S. offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Toyota typically doesn’t add a model to a plant unless it’s confident it can sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production fully ramps up. Company executives say they expect slow but steady growth in U.S. EV sales. At the same time, faster adoption in overseas markets offers an outlet for any U.S. production in excess of domestic demand.

Toyota's lithium-ion battery plant in Liberty, N.C. (Toyota)

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.”

That’s assuming President’s Donald Trump’s tariffs don’t upend the U.S. auto market and spur a retaliatory trade war.

The Japanese automaker is on track to start shipping lithium-ion batteries later this year from a massive plant in the rural town of Liberty, N.C., that sprawls over 1,850 acres. Of that facility’s 14 production lines, 10 are dedicated to electric vehicle battery cells with the remainder going to hybrid batteries.

It will supply cells earmarked for use in the two U.S.-made EVs.

The battery factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to be operational in June and the others will be brought online through 2034, the company said. It aims for production greater than 30 gigawatt hours at full capacity, or the equivalent of 800,000 hybrid, 150,000 plug-in hybrid and 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries.

Toyota's all-electric bZ4X soon will be renamed the bZ. (Toyota)

Total EV sales rose 7.3% in the U.S. last year to some 1.3 million vehicles, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelly Blue Book. But Toyota delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics skyrocketed.

The Japanese carmaker has been slower to jump on the EV bandwagon than most of its global rivals. It emerged as one of the biggest critics of policies designed to hasten EV adoption in the U.S. and has called on American policymakers to allow the market to dictate demand.

But Toyota is also reluctant to cede a market currently representing about 8% of U.S. sales to rivals such as General Motors Co., Tesla Inc., and Hyundai Motor Co. The company expects battery-electrics’ share of the American market to nearly double by 2030.

“BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us; They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

In addition to the all-electric bZ4X — which soon will be renamed the bZ — and Lexus RZ which it sells now, Toyota will add three more import EV models next year: The bZ Woodland, CH-R crossover and a version of the Lexus ES sedan.

Toyota’s factory in Georgetown, Ky. — its largest plant globally — currently manufactures some 550,000 vehicles annually, including top-selling models such as the RAV4 small SUV, Camry sedan and Lexus ES. The Camry went all-hybrid last year and the RAV4 will stop offering a gasoline-only version in its next model year. Toyota hasn’t disclosed the name of the all-electric model that will made there.

Similarly, it hasn’t provided details about the EV that will join larger models such as its Highlander SUV, Grand Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan that are made at its Princeton, Ind., factory, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-05/Toyota-plant-bb-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 19:07:26.044616

More: Toyota And Lexus Will Launch 15 EVs By 2027 And That’s Just The Start

First, Toyota is adding a few more electric options to its own lineup. Expect the facelifted bZ4X crossover (now named the bZ), the bZ Woodland, the C-HR, and an upcoming three-row SUV. On the Lexus side, the RZ crossover will be joined by an electric version of the new-generation ES sedan introduced last month and a larger SUV to boot.

US-Made Electric SUVs Are Coming

While many of these models will be imported, the big news is that the upcoming three-row SUVs, one from Toyota and one from Lexus, will be manufactured right here in the United States. After a brief delay, production will start in 2026 at two factories in Georgetown, Kentucky, and Princeton, Indiana. These new electric SUVs will go head-to-head with the likes of the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, which are also targeting the growing demand for larger electric vehicles.

Toyota isn’t diving into the EV market without a plan. According to Bloomberg, the company typically adds a new model to a factory only when it’s confident it can move 100,000-150,000 units annually. While US EV adoption is expected to grow at a slower rate than anticipated, Toyota has a strategy to keep production moving. Any excess EV output from its US factories will be sent to overseas markets where demand is ramping up faster.

Cooper Ericksen, Senior Vice President, Product, BEV and Mobility Planning and Strategy at Toyota Motor North America, explained: “We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market. But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the US will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.” Of course, the company hopes that its export plans won’t be affected by a potential escalation of the tariff war.

A Long-Term Commitment

Currently, electric vehicles account for just 8% of automotive sales in the US, but Toyota expects that number to double by 2030. Ericksen pointed out, “BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us. They’re cannibalizing our volume. But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

“EPA Region 7 is proud to work with our partners across the state of Kansas, advancing cooperative federalism and empowering local and state partners to take the lead in revitalizing their communities,” EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy said. “This collaborative approach ensures fiscal responsibility, promotes economic development, and transforms potentially contaminated properties into clean, usable land that supports long-term growth and sustainability.”

“The Community Wide Assessment Grant for State and Tribal will help increase property values and create jobs across Kansas,” Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Janet Stanek said. “Receiving these substantial dollars to support the redevelopment of brownfields throughout the state not only benefits the environment, but it elevates communities and industries by turning underutilized and vacant properties into productive ones. This is a win for the entire state.”

“The City of Beloit is incredibly grateful and excited to receive EPA Brownfield Cleanup funding. This funding enables our community to repurpose two vacant buildings into housing, a critical need in our rural community,” Mitchell County Economic Development Director Emily Benedick said. “This grant gives us the peace of mind to know we are providing a safe environment for future housing development.”

The following organizations in Kansas have been selected to receive EPA Brownfields funding:

The City of Beloit has been selected to receive $418,620. Grant funds will be used to clean up the Kansas Industrial School Campus, located at 1720 N. Hersey Avenue. The 0.8-acre cleanup site operated as a juvenile detention center for girls and has been vacant since 2009. It is contaminated with inorganic contaminants. Grant funds will also be used to conduct community engagement activities.

The Flint Hills Regional Council has been selected to receive $1 million. The grant will be used to capitalize a revolving loan fund (RLF), from which Flint Hills Regional Council Inc. will provide up to three loans and up to two subgrants to support cleanup activities. Grant funds will also be used to establish the RLF, market the program, and support community engagement activities. RLF activities will focus on Chase, Geary, Lyon, Morris, Pottawatomie, Riley, and Wabaunsee counties, with a focus on the cities of Herington, Junction City, and Manhattan.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has been selected to receive $2 million. Community-wide grant funds will be used to conduct 116 Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds will also support the development of at least three cleanup plans and at least one community meeting annually, with each community to provide general updates on the grant. The target area for this grant includes the Oak Grove neighborhood in Kansas City and the cities of Eureka and El Dorado. Priority sites include Land Bank properties in Oak Grove; a former horse racetrack, a former nursing home, sites adjacent to the existing fire department to accommodate its expansion, Memorial Hall, and the former Masonic Lodge in Eureka; and the Grizzly Development in El Dorado.

The City of Topeka has been selected to receive $500,000. Community-wide grant funds will be used to conduct eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds will also be used to inventory brownfield sites and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the City of Topeka. Priority sites include the 36-acre, former White Lakes Mall and two former schools.

Background:

EPA’s Brownfields program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfield investments have leveraged over $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding created over 220,500 jobs from both public and private sources.",https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/marshall_logo_white.png,N,,2025-05-29 19:08:01.084962

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

While remoteness remains a barrier, EVs are a great option if you’re mostly driving around town and are looking for ways to pay less for transportation.

Alaska EV Rebates

Alaska does not currently offer a state-level EV rebate. However, as of 2025, Alaska Power and Telephone offers rebates on EV purchases:

Alaska Power and Telephone EV Rebate

If you live in one of the 40 communities served by Alaska Power and Telephone, you can claim a $500 Alaska EV rebate just for buying an EV. Any electric car or motorcycle with a battery size over 14 kWh qualifies.

Alaska EV Tax Credits

Alaska does not have a state-wide EV tax credit, but residents may qualify for federal EV tax credits like the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit for new vehicles, or the $4,000 used clean vehicle tax credit.

Additionally, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit provides a federal tax credit up to $1,000 to offset costs related to installing an EV charger at home. Businesses can claim EV charger tax credits worth up to $100,000.

Alaska EV Charger Rebates

Charging your EV at home is both affordable and convenient. To achieve the best charging speed with your residential electrical infrastructure, it is essential to install a Level 2 EV charger with the help of a qualified EV charger installation professional.

Three utility providers in Alaska offer EV charger rebates with incentives ranging from $200 to $1,000 dollars:

Alaska Power and Telephone EV Charger Rebate

The Alaska Power and Telephone EV charger rebate isn’t available to residents, but local and tribal governments can receive up to $1,000 to help cover the cost of installing a public EV charging station.

Chugach Electric Association EV Charger Rebate

As a Chugach Electric Association residential customer, you can claim a $200 rebate on Level 2 home chargers.

Kodiak Electric Association EV Charger Rebate

Kodiak Electric will credit you up to $500 for installing a residential EV charger within their service territory. Once the utility approves your project, you’ll receive a $500 rebate spread over the 12 months following the install.

EV Charging Rates in Alaska

At $0.24 per kWh, Alaska’s average residential electrical rate is slightly higher than the rest of the country. This is primarily due to the state’s highly fragmented and spread-out power grid, which covers vast areas.

For EV owners, charging at home remains cheaper than in public, and time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates can unlock savings. These plans incentivize vehicle charging during off-peak hours, making EV ownership more affordable.

Alaska Electric Light & Power Company

This utility offers a special rate for EV owners. Instead of paying the standard rate of $0.10 per kWh, you can set up a separate meter for your at-home charger and pay $0.05 per kWh.

Public EV Charging Stations in Alaska

Alaska’s public EV charging network is growing due to efforts from businesses, utility companies, and public agencies. For instance, the Alaska Energy Authority has used NEVI funds to install Level 2 chargers at public facilities in Anchorage.

How Many Public EV Charging Stations Are in Alaska?

As of May 2025, Alaska has over 60 EV charging stations including 53 Level 2 and 19 DC Fast charging stations. There are 145 public EV charging ports, 2 Tesla Supercharger stations and 12 Tesla Supercharger ports in Alaska.

The Ford BlueOval network, with around 15 locations in the Anchorage area, is another option to consider.

How Much Do Public EV Charging Stations Cost in Alaska?

Prices vary by network and location. For instance, the two DC Fast chargers owned and operated by the Grand Valley Electric Association in Fairbanks cost $0.20 per minute. If you charge at the Midas auto repair shop on East Steam Commons Avenue in Wasilla, you’ll have to pay $4 per hour.

Be sure to read our article discussing the Cost of Charging an EV at Home vs. Public Charging.

Are There Free EV Charging Stations in Alaska?

The charging station inside the East Park Garage on 7th Avenue and G Street in Anchorage and the charger at the Alaska Electric Light & Power facility on Tonsgard Court in Juneau are free to use

Where Are Public EV Charging Stations Located in Alaska?

Major cities like Anchorage and Juneau have more charging options. Generally speaking, you’ll find EV stations along the state’s Southern coast.

Visit the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center Map of EV Charging Station Locations in Alaska, which can be sorted and filtered based on public access, charger type (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast), and connector type (NACS, J1772, CCS, CHAdeMO).

Home Electrification Incentives in Alaska

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.",https://qmerit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/alaska-ev-rebates-incentives-tax-credits-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 22:07:15.039579

Below are eight policies that we listed that reduce competition and increase energy prices.
Renewable Fuel Standard.
Passed by Congress in 2005 and amended in 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard requires a certain amount of renewable fuels be blended into the transportation fuel mix each year.
These state level policies (RPSs) require that a certain portion of a state’s power come from renewable sources by a given year.","The US Department of Justice’s Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force was accepting comments from the public in part “seeking information about laws and regulations that make it more difficult for businesses to compete effectively, especially in markets that have the greatest impact on American households.” The comment period closed on May 27.

One of the identified markets was the energy market. When looking at energy-related laws and regulations, the harmful effects are not limited to the energy sector. Policies that increase energy prices, such as laws that reduce competition, have effects across the entire economy, including the other markets specifically identified by the Task Force: housing, transportation, food and agriculture, and healthcare.

My colleagues Paige Lambermont and Ben Lieberman co-authored a comment with me that we sent to the Task Force. Below are eight policies that we listed that reduce competition and increase energy prices. This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it is a good starting point.

EPA’s De Facto EV Mandate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule that would help to kill off gas-powered cars. According to the EPA, by 2032, 56 percent of new light-duty vehicles sold will be battery electric vehicles (EVs) and 13 percent will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Less than 30 percent will be internal combustion engine vehicles. This is a direct attack on competition within the automobile industry. It would intentionally shift Americans into vehicles that are more expensive and less reliable than gas-powered vehicles.

The EPA’s Clean Power Plan 2.0. The EPA finalized a rule that would once again have the agency act as the nation’s grid manager. The agency’s goal is to shift electricity generation from reliable sources of electricity (e.g. coal and natural gas) to unreliable sources of electricity (wind and solar). This rule literally seeks to kill off power generation by coal and natural gas.

The IRA’s “Green” Subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) uses a wide range of subsidies, from loans, grants, to tax credits, to change how the nation produces and use energy. Like the Clean Power Plan 2.0, the subsidies are intended to shift the country away from reliable sources of electricity, reducing competition and driving up prices. There are IRA subsidies, which like the EPA’s de facto EV mandate would attempt to kill off gas-powered cars and get people driving EVs or out of cars altogether. The IRA is filled with harmful policies as well connected to appliances and housing.

HUD and USDA Housing Codes. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted stringent international building code provisions for all new homes qualifying for federally backed mortgages. According to the National Association of Home Builders, these provisions could add up to $31,000 to the cost of a compliant new home.

Residential Air Conditioning Rule. A 2023 Biden EPA regulation requires that all new residential air conditioning systems manufactured on or after January 1, 2025 must use certain agency-approved refrigerants deemed sufficiently climate friendly. Doing so has created a captive market for more expensive air conditioning systems. In addition, several of the compliant refrigerants used in these systems are proprietary and can only be made by the two companies holding the patents for them, and they cost many times more than the previously-used refrigerants that are now illegal in new equipment. See e.g., https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ModernizingtheEPA_v2-chap2.pdf (pp.126-128).

The Jones Act. This more than 100-year-old shipping law forbids the movement of goods between two US ports on noncompliant vessels, making it expensive and difficult for some parts of the United States to maintain reliable supplies of natural gas. The Jones Act’s requirements that vessels be US-owned,-built,-crewed, and -registered means that no LNG tankers comply with the law. Therefore, it is impossible to move significant volumes of LNG between US ports. This is particularly unfortunate for states and territories with unique geographies and makes it hard for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and New England among others to depend on this otherwise reliable fuel for power and other uses.

Renewable Fuel Standard. Passed by Congress in 2005 and amended in 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard requires a certain amount of renewable fuels be blended into the transportation fuel mix each year. This comes largely in the form of ethanol and other biofuels. The requirement is in essence a subsidy to the producers of these fuels at the expense of everyone who purchases gasoline or diesel fuel.

Renewable Portfolio Standards. These state level policies (RPSs) require that a certain portion of a state’s power come from renewable sources by a given year. They raise prices and endanger reliability. Because of the interconnected nature of the US power grid, these policies also end up having consequences for states that have not adopted RPSs because they must make up the shortfalls of states with whom they share a grid.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Energy-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:59.726665

After news that a building bought by an EV charging station company is set for demolition, parents of a school located right across the street are nervous about the future and want answers.

Demolition plans for the site of a former Kentucky Fried Chicken at 9201 Fifth Ave. were submitted to the Department of Buildings by Vincent Aiello, founder of home construction firm Monello Industries, according to Crain’s New York Business.

The outlet adds that the space was bought in 2022 by EVgo for $5.3 million.

P.S. 104 is located across the street from the site and parents are worried about children’s safety if a charging station would be so close to the school.

First Vice President of Community Education Council District 20 John Ricottone released a statement about his concern.

“First and foremost, there are currently no comprehensive studies on the long-term impact of EV charging stations on growing children, especially those in the kindergarten through fifth-grade age group,” he said. “Installing such infrastructure near an elementary school raises valid health and safety questions that remain unanswered.”

He also noted the area’s history of traffic accidents.

“The installation of an EV charging station—likely to increase vehicle traffic and distractions—could further endanger students, staff, and families during drop-off and pick-up times,” Ricottone said. “It’s not yet clear how many entry and exit points this facility would have, whether it will be operating 24/7, or what kind of security measures will be in place. All of these are critical details that must be publicly clarified before moving forward.”

He also believes that high-voltage electrical equipment requires stringent safeguards.

Still, the aesthetic works. The pixelated lighting remains​, a sharp throwback to 8-bit cool​, and the whole package is retro-modern in a way that feels intentional, not nostalgic. Hyundai didn’t chase trends. They started one.

The Plug Heard Round the World

The biggest news? The XRT is the first non-Tesla EV in the U.S. to come with the North American Charging Standard (NACS). That’s Tesla’s plug, in case you’ve missed a year of headlines. And it means Ioniq 5 owners will have access to over 15,000 Tesla Superchargers by 2025.

With one plug swap and a handshake, Hyundai solved range anxiety in a way that software updates and clever apps never could. The Ioniq 5 isn’t just playing catch-up​, it’s leapfrogging the competition.

Lounge Meets Spaceship

Inside, the XRT is everything EV cabins promise but rarely deliver. Flat floors. A slide-away center console. Space to stretch and stash your gear. It’s minimal without being stark, and comfy without screaming “luxury tax.” Think Scandinavian design with a side of sci-fi.

It’s also practical. With vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability, the Ioniq 5 can power your laptop, your blender, or even a tent full of string lights. It’s a campsite-ready power station on wheels, which is more than can be said for most SUVs still stuck on cupholders as innovation.

Performance With a Punch

Don’t be fooled by the friendly face. This thing has torque​,​ 446 pound-feet of it, to be exact. With dual motors pushing out 320 horsepower, the Ioniq 5 XRT hits 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. That’s quicker than some sports sedans, in a body that can carry dogs, groceries, and everything in between.

It’s not just fast in a straight line, either. Thanks to Hyundai’s E-GMP platform and 800-volt architecture, it charges from 10 to 80 percent in under 18 minutes. That’s a lunch break—not an overnight stay.

The Flaws (Because Every Hero Needs One)

The XRT isn’t perfect. It lacks a rear wiper, which feels like an odd omission on a vehicle made to look outdoorsy. And while the exterior screams trailhead-ready, there’s no real off-road gear under the surface. It’s more about looking adventurous than conquering the unknown.

But maybe that’s the point. Most owners won’t be rock-crawling. They’ll be hauling gear to the cabin, picking up the kids, or squeezing in a long weekend somewhere with cell signal. And for that crowd, the XRT is more than enough.

Verdict: Hyundai’s Got Grit

The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just another electric SUV. It’s a bold statement from an automaker that’s no longer content to follow the rules—or the leaders. With Tesla’s plug onboard, class-leading charge times, and just enough off-road swagger, the Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just in the game. It’s changing.

The findings, published in an open-access paper in Science Advances, challenge the assumption that filtered exhaust from EURO 6d-compliant vehicles is inherently safe.

The research focused on a gasoline vehicle equipped with a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), designed to drastically reduce primary particulate emissions. Freshly emitted exhaust showed no detectable cytotoxic effects on human lung cells. However, once the exhaust underwent photochemical aging—a natural transformation process driven by sunlight and atmospheric oxidants—it became substantially more toxic.

The aged emissions caused notable DNA damage and oxidative stress in both cancerous alveolar and normal bronchial epithelial cells. This toxicity was not only associated with newly formed particles, known as secondary organic and inorganic aerosols (SOA and SIA), but also with oxygenated volatile compounds, such as carbonyls, generated during their residence in the atmosphere.

According to Dr. Mathilde Delaval, first author of the study and researcher at Helmholtz Munich, these findings point to a critical shortfall in current vehicle emissions testing and regulation. While EURO 6d standards ensure low emissions at the tailpipe, they do not account for the chemical transformations those emissions undergo once released into the environment.

Our study shows that we are missing a big part of the picture by not considering how exhaust gases change and become more harmful after they leave the car.

—Dr. Mathilde Delaval

The results have important implications for how air quality standards are set and monitored. Current regulations focus primarily on the emissions measured directly after combustion, without factoring in how these emissions interact with sunlight and atmospheric chemicals to form new, more harmful pollutants.

There’s a clear disconnect between how we test vehicle emissions in the lab and how those emissions behave in the real world. If we ignore what happens to exhaust after it enters the atmosphere, we risk underestimating the true health impact of traffic-related air pollution.

—co-author Dr. Hendryk Czech from Helmholtz Munich and the University of Rostock

Air pollution remains a major global health issue, responsible for increased rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death. The discovery that filtered emissions from even the cleanest gasoline cars can still become toxic once airborne suggests that future regulations must evolve to address both primary and secondary pollutants.

This study was a joint effort by a multidisciplinary team of biologists, aerosol physicists, and chemists investigating the health impacts of air pollution. Led by Prof. Ralf Zimmermann, professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Rostock and head of the Joint Mass Spectrometry Group at Helmholtz Munich and the University of Rostock, the project brought together researchers from Germany, Finland, Switzerland, and Israel.

Key collaborators came from Helmholtz Munich, the University of Rostock, the University of Eastern Finland, Research Center Jülich, the Weizmann Institute of Science, the University of Basel, and the University of the Bundeswehr Munich. The work was conducted within the Helmholtz International Lab “aeroHEALTH” and supported by the EU-funded project “ULTRHAS,” with core experiments carried out at the ILMARI research facility in Kuopio, Finland, led by Prof. Olli Sippula.

Community & Worker Economic Transition Office launches MI Hub for Manufacturing with support from philanthropy

Michigan is a top 10 state for clean energy jobs, leads the nation for total jobs in advanced materials and has the fastest-growing workforce for energy-efficient HVAC and renewable heating and cooling

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. — The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Community & Worker Economic Transition Office announced a public-private partnership designed to create and retain good-paying jobs, support Michigan manufacturers and strengthen the state’s position as a global leader in the energy supply chain at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually — $2 billion from DTE and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses. This historic commitment is focused on strengthening local supply chains for critical energy infrastructure, such as transformers, and next-generation technologies, including solar components and long-duration energy storage systems.

""Michigan is paving the way growing our economy and meeting our ambitious energy goals,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Today, we’re launching new resources designed to support our manufacturers and help them create and retain good-paying jobs while building strong, resilient energy supply chains right here in Michigan. This partnership will position our manufacturers to lead in the clean energy future, keeping production local and ensure that Michigan remains a hub of innovation and industry. Let’s keep working hard to make a difference and build a Michigan where everyone can thrive.”

“We know we can keep Michigan as a leader in manufacturing, while also strengthening the prosperity of everyone in our state,” said Community & Worker Economic Transition Office Director Jonathan Smith. ""Through innovative partnerships like this one between government, industry, nonprofit organizations and philanthropy we can deliver powerful lasting, impactful solutions that help our businesses, workers and communities plan for and thrive in the future.""

The State of Michigan will work closely with DTE and Consumers Energy to identify in-state suppliers, help them retool to meet the energy sector’s needs and connect them with the resources necessary to grow and compete. The partnership will reduce long lead times for critical equipment and components that currently have few or zero domestic suppliers. Having more local suppliers also means keeping prices affordable for Michigan ratepayers.

“DTE has a long history of partnering with Michigan businesses to keep our spending local, and we’re proud to build on that history by committing to spend $2 billion annually with Michigan suppliers,” said Trevor Lauer, vice chairman and group president, DTE Energy. “Focusing on keeping our spending in-state has a transformative impact on the Michigan economy, allowing businesses to grow and creating thousands of jobs, while also helping DTE to build an agile supply chain that allows us to deliver the services our customers demand and deserve.”

The partnership will also help utilities more quickly and efficiently meet their reliability and resiliency goals, putting Michigan on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“We'd love to see Michigan’s manufacturing talent and expertise build the energy equipment we need right here at home,” said Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. “Cultivating and buying from a resilient, robust energy supply chain in Michigan continues Consumers Energy’s longstanding commitment to in-state suppliers. It’s the natural next step, and the right thing for Consumers Energy, our customers and the state.”

To help manufacturers and clean energy startups retool their facilities and retain their workers to support new work coming in from utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy, the Transition Office is also launching the MI Hub for Manufacturers. With $1.5 million in support from philanthropy and a partnership with Next Street, a national small business and supplier solutions company, this dynamic, interactive online platform will connect small and mid-sized manufactures to public, private and non-profit resources. The platform will publish funding opportunities, connect businesses to expert advisors and capital products, provide on-demand digital learning tools and host partner resources that can help suppliers diversify and grow to enter new supply chains.

“We are proud to partner with the State of Michigan to equip manufacturers with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive, grow, and lead in an evolving industrial landscape,” said CEO of Next Street, Charisse Conanan Johnson. “The MI Hub for Manufacturers is a powerful example of public-private partnership — bringing together government, philanthropy, industry, and community organizations to deliver real value to small and mid-sized businesses. Equitable economic growth starts by unlocking the full potential of our local supply chains, and Michigan is setting the standard for what that looks like.”

The 2024 Clean Jobs America Report stated that clean energy businesses in Michigan added more than 5,200 workers and now employ 127,690 Michiganders. According to Clean Jobs Midwest and Climate Power, the state is projected to add 167,000 clean energy jobs over the next decade, continuing Michigan’s leadership as the no. 1 state in the nation for IRA-funded projects that have resulted in more than $25B in new investments and over 21,400 new jobs across the state.

“The Community and Worker Economic Transition Office will help ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy,” Glenn Stevens Jr., Executive Director, MichAuto at the Detroit Regional Chamber. “This work resonates strongly with MichAuto's mission to ensure the state's signature automotive and mobility industry, Michigan, and its workers continue to lead the world in automotive manufacturing and innovation well into the future.”",https://www.michigan.gov/leo/-/media/Project/Websites/leo/Images/Executive1/LEO_WebIMG/Someone-working-on-their-computer.jpg?rev=4a01d7cb73304829b4bbfbd5b080a586&hash=828DA554C5E1A9686253BB3B6A1EB500,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:31.492213

The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Montana and challenges executive orders 14156, 14154 and 14261, which declare a “National Energy Emergency.” The Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NASA are named as defendants in the suit.

“[President] Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” plaintiff Eva Lighthiser said.

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution,” she added.

They’ve alleged that the president’s executive orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty by “deliberately worsening” climate pollution that threatens their health and futures.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has issued orders aimed at expediting energy and infrastructure projects; promoting the use of coal, critical minerals and fossil fuels; and sunsetting EPA regulations that prevent mining and offshore drilling.

Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported.
Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter.
And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.","Businesses have cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion of investments in U.S. clean energy projects so far this year, reflecting their uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid President Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat, industry analysts reported Thursday.

The sector still is showing resilience—at least $4.2 billion in new renewable energy, grid, electric vehicle and battery projects were announced over the same time period, from January through April, according to the tracking report by the nonprofit group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2, and its research partner, Atlas Public Policy.

Some 10,000 jobs are expected to be created by these newly announced projects—including an electric truck assembly plant that the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto said it would site in Warsaw, Indiana. That’s equal to the estimated number of job losses from all the clean energy projects that have been abandoned so far this year. Nevertheless, it’s a sharp reversal of trends E2 tracked in the sector over the previous three years, when $127.7 billion in new clean energy project announcements outpaced cancellations at a rate of nearly 50-to-1.

Officials at E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders and investors, said it was an ominous sign as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the House-passed tax and spending cut package that would eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director for E2. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the report.

The biggest of the cancellations that E2 tracked came in April. The United Auto Workers announced that Stellantis would not go forward with a $3.2 billion battery plant it planned to add to a giant shuttered assembly facility it is reopening in Belvidere, Illinois. And global energy giant RWE announced it was shuttering its U.S. offshore wind operations “for the time being” due to “the political environment” in the United States. RWE had invested $1.1 billion to develop wind projects offshore of New York, Louisiana and California.

While E2 tracks public announcements of new projects and cancellations, other efforts at tracking what’s happening in the clean energy sector provide a more detailed picture—and in some senses, a more optimistic one.

The Clean Investment Monitor, a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the consulting firm Rhodium Group, tracks actual capital spending in the quarter of all projects that have broken ground, and also includes investment in decarbonization projects at energy and industrial plants as well as consumer spending—for example, on EVs, rooftop solar and efficiency upgrades. For the first quarter of 2025, Clean Investment Monitor reported $67.3 billion in spending, a 6.9 percent increase from the same period in 2024. However, it was a 3.8 percent falloff from the previous quarter, and the second consecutive quarterly decline after an unbroken record of quarterly expansion that began in 2021.

Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported. Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter. And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.

The American Clean Power Association (ACPA), which tracks utility-scale electricity projects, also put out its first quarter report Thursday, showing that developers installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity, marking the second-strongest start to a year on record. (The strongest start on record was 2024, when 8 gigawatts came on line.) That brings total utility-scale clean power capacity to more than 320 gigawatts, which the association estimates is enough to power nearly 80 million U.S. homes. Of course, that electricity is not only powering homes but also businesses, where power demand is rising sharply due to data centers.

It was a record-setting quarter for battery storage capacity, which surpassed 30 gigawatts, a 65 percent increase from last year. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity in just one quarter, with the help of a big system owned by the energy company AES that opened in April at the site of a former coal power plant.

Texas continued to lead the nation in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity, with its total clean energy portfolio reaching more than 80 gigawatts, a 20 percent increase from a year ago, ACPA said. In all, eight of the top 10 states for clean power additions in the quarter voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election.

The association also saw continuing growth in the project development pipeline, with a 12 percent year-over-year increase in projects under construction or in the advanced stages of development. If all are built, it would add up to $328 billion in investment, said the group’s CEO, Jason Grumet.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale,” he said, while echoing E2’s concerns about the retreat from federal support for the sector in Washington.

“With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” Grumet said. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1470383347-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:48.464147

If that were to happen, it would harm the business case in Marshall, said Bill Ford.
Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.
Ford made his remarks after an on-stage interview alongside his daughter and Ford board member Alexandra Ford English at the Mackinac Policy Conference.
Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, is the automaker’s fourth leader from the family in its more than 120-year existence.","The executive chairman of Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that its $2.5 billion electric vehicle battery factory in Marshall would be “in peril” if it loses production tax credits as called for in proposed U.S. House legislation.

The bill, which still must be reconciled by the Senate, could make the plant ineligible for a key manufacturing subsidy due to its ties to Chinese battery company CATL. If that were to happen, it would harm the business case in Marshall, said Bill Ford.

“We have built the business case on Marshall around that,” the chairman told reporters after a panel discussion at the Mackinac Policy Conference. “My point is politicians can agree or disagree whether those kind of things are desirable, and that’s fine. But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness, and that’s unfair.”

The company likely will press hard to change the language of the final bill to ensure the factory, set to launch production next year, makes it to the finish line. While some lawmakers are seeking to keep tax credits away form “foreign entities of concern,” as CATL is labeled in the proposed bill, the factory in Marshall would create 1,700 jobs and serve as an economic catalyst, the automaker and proponents has argued.

Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.

“I don’t know the likelihood, but I do know that if it goes away, it puts in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan,” he said.

Also Thursday, Ford was joined by more than 100 Marshall area business owners and leaders who publicized a letter to Michigan’s congressional delegation urging the preservation of the tax credit.

“As Congress continues to work through the budget reconciliation process, we ask that you consider how important the Production Tax Credit is to potential economic growth for families and businesses across the Calhoun County region,” the letter reads.

Ford made his remarks after an on-stage interview alongside his daughter and Ford board member Alexandra Ford English at the Mackinac Policy Conference. The discussion, moderated by former TV anchor Christy McDonald, centered on the father-daughter dynamics in one of America’s most famous family businesses.

Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, is the automaker’s fourth leader from the family in its more than 120-year existence. English was elected to the automaker’s influential board of directors in 2021, along with her cousin Henry Ford III, son of Edsel B. Ford II, a former board member and director at the company.

English began her career in retail, working at Gap Inc. and Tory Burch. Even if she had wanted to jump straight from college to the automaker, her father wouldn’t have allowed it. Bill Ford’s rule is that family members cannot go right into the business.

“We cannot be a family employment agency,” Ford said. “We want to make sure the young people that come into our company are incredibly well qualified and motivated.”

English served as an employee at the automaker from 2017 until June 2022, running operations for Ford’s Autonomous Vehicle LLC before the company shut down efforts to develop a fully autonomous vehicle.

She said the inspiration to work for the automaker started when her father would come home from work and talk to his family about his day. The family values and those of the company are one in the same, she said, making it a seamless cultural fit working for the automaker.

“Whenever he spoke about employees, it was always with deep respect, and that leaves an impression,” English said. “I don’t remember anything other than those values. It’s all we know.”

Ford said one characteristic English is never afraid to bring to the table – over family dinner or in the boardroom – is brutal honesty. That’s important, the chairman said, because most others aren’t willing to be that blunt with the boss.

“She’s always the one that will sit me down and tell me what I don’t want to hear,” he said. “Not many people in life will do that. She’s been the brave one.”

On the topic of constantly shifting federal policy under President Donald Trump, the chairman said his company, expecting to take a $1.5 billion tariff hit this year, speaks with the White House on a near daily basis. Ford, which boasts the most U.S.-based vehicle production among its domestic counterparts, hopes the Trump administration and lawmakers recognize that when devising policy that could impact its Marshall factory and broader production plans.

The company’s decision to build more in the U.S. amounts to a $2,000 per vehicle “penalty” compared to customers more exposed to foreign manufacturing, the chairman said.

“For us, it was the right decision to invest in America and pay that penalty,” he said. “I don’t regret that for a minute.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/54554861965_b96f756d91_o.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 20:07:43.522691

Ford Says Michigan Battery Plant at Risk If Tax Credits Are Cut Back to video

The plant in Marshall, Michigan — and the 1,700 workers that Ford plans to employ there — would be “imperiled” if US lawmakers move to eliminate tax credits that support battery producers as part of a broader tax plan moving through congress, Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said Thursday during remarks at the Mackinac Policy Conference at Michigan’s Mackinac Island.

“It’s not fair to change policy after all the expenditures have been made,” Ford said. “The production tax credit seems to be up for grabs.”

After the event, Ford told reporters that “nothing needs to change” about the production tax credit because “we have built the business case on Marshall around that.”

President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill included several tax credits designed to help establish an EV supply chain and support consumer demand for plug-in cars.

Article content

Republican lawmakers are moving to unwind those policies. In addition to phasing out a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, the House-passed bill would end a manufacturing credit for battery makers after 2031. It would also mandate strict restrictions against the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts say could effectively render it useless.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment because that to me is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”

The legislative risks mark the latest potential hurdle for a plant Ford announced in 2023 that was originally intended to produce enough batteries for 400,000 EVs, part of an earlier ambitious plan to electrify its lineup. The automaker later reduced that target to power about 230,000 EVs as consumer demand for the technology faltered.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/775940258.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:27.114771

​​​​​​​Story 8: Peter Biello: The Columbus City Council voted this week to fire City Manager Isaiah Hugley, just seven months from his retirement.","Peter Biello: Welcome to the Georgia Today podcast. Here, we feature the latest reports from the GPB News team. On today's episode, Georgia loses billions of dollars in clean energy investments. SNAP recipients say they've lost $23 million to theft, and the Columbus City Council this week fired its long-serving city manager, Isaiah Hugley. His lawyer is arguing —

Chuck Williams: The council went through this termination and the statements are trying to discredit Mr. Hugley in advance of a political campaign.

Peter Biello: Today is Thursday, May 29. I'm Peter Biello, and this is Georgia Today.

Story 1:

Peter Biello: Metro Atlanta congressman Hank Johnson heard from frustrated constituents at a packed town hall meeting last night. The Democrat is one of the few federal lawmakers in Georgia holding in-person public meetings as they've grown more contentious. GPB's Sarah Kallis reports.

Sarah Kallis: Constituents at the town hall pressed Johnson on why Democrats in Congress are not doing more to block Trump's agenda. He says he understands the frustration, but it is up to the people now to vote Democrats back into the majority.

Hank Johnson: No point in blaming Democrats for us being in this situation where our democracy is threatened, our economy is threatened, our public health, our national security being threatened. There's no point in pointing fingers at each other about that. We must confront the threat to our existence that is posed by Donald Trump.

Sarah Kallis: Republicans outnumbered Democrats in both the U.S. House and Senate. The next time that could change could be the 2026 midterm elections. For GPB News, I'm Sarah Kallis in Gwinnett County.

Story 2:

Peter Biello: The legacy of the late congressman John Lewis will be celebrated in Atlanta tonight. The John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation is hosting its annual Good Trouble Gala for the first time in the city the couple called home. Dietra Austin Everson is the Foundation's president and CEO.

Dietra Austin Everson: Most people may not know that Congressman Lewis established the foundation here in Atlanta, Ga. And so this is home for Congressman Lewis's life and legacy. And it is home for the John and Lillian Miles Lewis foundation.

Peter Biello: This year's honorees include Smithsonian secretary Lonnie Bunch and Atlanta Trailblazer Billie Suber Aaron, widow of baseball great Hank Aaron.

Story 3:

Peter Biello: Wildlife conservationists with the Jekyll Island Authority have launched two online maps designed to share real-time turtle data with the public. GPB's Benjamin Payne has more.

Benjamin Payne: One of the trackers shows loggerhead sea turtle nesting hotspots along the beaches of Jekyll Island. The other map focuses on a different species of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, pinpointing individual turtle sightings along the Jekyll Island causeway, where they often get hit by cars. Joseph Colbert is a biologist with the Jekyll Island Authority.

Joseph Colbert: Every time something is collected out in the field, it automatically updates on that dashboard. So it's really cool technology and data.

Benjamin Payne: More than 250 diamondback terrapins have been found so far this year along the Jekyll Island Causeway with about two-thirds of them saved, and the island has recorded about 40 sea turtle nests. For GPB News, I'm Benjamin Payne.

Story 4:

Peter Biello: More than $3 billion in clean energy investments in Georgia have been canceled or delayed this year. That's according to an analysis released today by the national nonpartisan business group E2. The Georgia number represents about 1,300 jobs lost in about a quarter of all the clean energy investments canceled this year across the country. They include four Georgia projects in Bullock, Coweta, Stevens, and Richmond counties. Cancellations have come as President Donald Trump's pending tax and spending bill raises fears over the future of American battery, electric vehicle, and solar and wind energy development.

​​​​​​​Story 5:

Peter Biello: Georgians receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits have reported more than $23 million in stolen benefits so far this year. Numbers from the Georgia Department of Human Services show the size of a security problem hitting food aid recipients through their EBT cards. Many of the victims say they get little to no help trying to get the money back. DHS says it investigates every report and is working with law enforcement.

​​​​​​​Story 6:

Peter Biello: State regulators have approved the proposed merger between Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare and Warner Robbins-based Houston Health Care. The two systems said yesterday the OK from the Georgia Attorney General's office means the merger is set to become official on June 1.

​​​​​​​Story 7:

Peter Biello: The University of West Georgia is getting a new president. The Board of Regents yesterday named Mike Johnson the sole finalist to lead the school based in Carrollton. Johnson currently serves as chief of staff at the University of Houston.

​​​​​​​Story 8:

Peter Biello: The Columbus City Council voted this week to fire City Manager Isaiah Hugley, just seven months from his retirement. This comes after Hugley threatened legal action against several members of the council. Chuck Williams, a reporter for WRBL News 3 in Columbus, has been following this story and joins me from his newsroom. Welcome to the program.

Chuck Williams: Good to be with you, Peter; I hope things are going well up your way.

Peter Biello: Thank you very much. They are. Appreciate that. So first of all tell us about this firing; did the city council members who voted for determination elaborate on the reason why?

Chuck Williams: Uh, they did. They presented Mr. Hugley, who has been the city manager in Columbus, Ga., for 20 years — two decades — the reason they gave in a notice of termination. And I'll just read it. It makes more sense to do it that way. ""Pursuant to your employment agreement, this letter serves as formal written notice of the grounds of your termination. Over the past several months, departments under your direct supervision, including animal control and finance, have experienced ongoing operational failures and lapses in oversight, some of which have resulted in law enforcement scrutiny, in certain instances, criminal investigation. These investigations have resulted in great expense to the city and its taxpayers."" So that's why they say he was terminated.

Peter Biello: So a few things having to do with actual problems. But can you tell us a little bit about one of those problems they mentioned and — and explain why that might really warrant a firing.

Chuck Williams: We had some issues within animal control last year. Several people who worked there were investigated by Columbus Police and were arrested and charged with a variety of charges. It had to do with treatment of some of the animals in the facility. And then our finance department has been under scrutiny for almost two years now. A audit came back with a lot of issues and potential missing money. Troutman Pepper, out of Atlanta, was hired. A guy named Charles Peeler — Charlie Peeler was a former U.S. Attorney — he came in here, did an extensive investigation, was hired by city council to look at it. He found issues, he found some mismanagement, but he found nothing that rose to the level of criminal charges.

Peter Biello: In the context, as I mentioned, was Hugley's threats to sue council members for comments that they made. What did they say that upset Hugley?

Chuck Williams: They involved a 2022 federal grant that was part of the American Recovery Act that was given to Carolyn Hugley, a state farm agent who was the wife of Isaiah Hugley. Carolyn Hugly is a name that may be familiar to some people. She is a state representative from Columbus. She is also the minority leader in the Georgia House and was recently elected that post last year. The grant was administered through the city and the facts that have come out are when that grant crossed the city manager's desk he immediately sought advice from the city attorney informed the mayor and then the deputy city attorney handled that and he removed himself from the process. And as he did that, some counselors have questioned that he should have told counsel, according to our charter, and he did not. And it became a fight.

Peter Biello: I see. And the city council did not cite that as the reason for his termination, but that fight is a known part of the story here.

Chuck Williams: Interestingly, it is not in the termination letter. And it's termination in name only, quite frankly, because he had announced he would retire at the end of the year. As part of this termination notice, the last paragraph: ""council will continue to pay your regular salary along with existing benefits, including health insurance, life insurance, and pension accrual through the announced retirement date of December 31, 2025.""

Peter Biello: What's next for Isaiah Hugley? Is there any sense of what's in the future for him?

Chuck Williams: This is a fluid situation. And one of the things that is happening out of this is there is speculation that Mr. Hugley will run for mayor in the 2026 election. And his attorney claims that there's a fear of him running for the mayor's office and they are trying — the council, with — through this termination and the statements are trying to discredit Mr. Hughley in advance of a political campaign. The counselors, the seven counselors that voted to terminate him — and it was a 7-3 vote — have only legal advice or not talking about what they did. They're letting the termination notice stand for itself.

Peter Biello: Chuck Williams, a reporter for WRBL News 3 in Columbus, thank you so much for speaking with me about this.

Chuck Williams: Thank you very much, Peter, for having me. I hope you have a great weekend or week or whatever we're looking at right now.

Peter Biello: Thanks, you too. Appreciate it.

To begin, Hall acknowledged that both dealers and consumers are navigating an uncertain economy, made more volatile by ongoing tariff discussions and policy shifts.

“No matter what happens [in the economy], we learn to turn nothing into something positive.” – Don Hall","As economic uncertainty, policy shifts, and global competition create turmoil in the auto industry, Don Hall, President and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA), says optimism and leadership are more important than ever. On the latest episode of Inside Automotive, Hall shares his insights on staying resilient, capitalizing on evolving consumer preferences, and reinforcing the strength of the franchise system.

To begin, Hall acknowledged that both dealers and consumers are navigating an uncertain economy, made more volatile by ongoing tariff discussions and policy shifts. “Every day, when it comes to tariffs, we’re hearing something different,” he said, emphasizing that dealership leaders must stay focused and inspire their teams. However, despite external noise, Hall maintains that “we’re still selling cars and trucks”—the real question is whether dealers are claiming their fair share of the market.

According to Hall, he urges dealers to reconnect with former customers, work harder, and embrace evolving customer expectations. Stating, “It’s about the customer. It’s about the customer buying experience.” He then adds, “Let’s be long-term thinkers.”

Shifting to the Virginia market, Hall noted that plug-in hybrid sales are rising, Tesla sales are declining, and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are seeing renewed strength, thanks in part to the state no longer being governed by California’s CARB regulations. Meanwhile, OEMs like Toyota are leading the hybrid charge, with Hall praising the versatility of EVs and hybrids, saying they offer consumers more choice and less range anxiety.

Additionally, Hall addressed the potential influx of Chinese vehicles following a recent deal struck by President Trump, which has OEMs like BYD eyeing U.S. entry. Hall cautioned that these manufacturers must respect the U.S. franchise dealer system, which has been the backbone of the auto industry for over 100 years. “We’ve got plenty of dealers nationwide ready and willing to partner with whomever,” he said.

When asked what OEM leaders need to better understand, Hall highlights a lack of familiarity with dealership operations. Having met with nine different OEM heads during his career, he noted that many come from engineering backgrounds and don’t fully grasp the role associations like VADA play, or the value that franchised dealers bring to the table.

It is important to note that Hall called on dealers to also share positive anecdotes to reevaluate the industry’s image.

In conclusion, Hall shares his outlook for the remainder of 2025: “Car dealers are eternal optimists.” With the stock market up and dealer sentiment positive, he reiterates that a strong customer experience and staff culture will carry the industry forward.

ALBANS, Vt., May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- PurposeEnergy, a leading provider of organic waste-to-renewable energy solutions, proudly announces the Grand Opening of its state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion facility in St. Albans, Vermont. Construction began in May 2023, and the facility began exporting electricity to the Vermont grid in December 2024. This milestone marks PurposeEnergy's first project fully funded by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners (Quinbrook) following the firm's acquisition of PurposeEnergy in April 2023.

PurposeEnergy and Ben & Jerry's signed a long-term feedstock agreement in 2021, laying the groundwork for the St. Albans facility, which converts high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products into renewable energy and clean water. Ben & Jerry's sends production waste streams via a dedicated pipeline directly to the facility.

Additional feedstocks from regional producers are transported by Casella, Wind River Environmental, Evergreen Services, and Carmichael Trucking—helping to centralize food waste management and expand the facility's positive environmental impact.

""This project strengthens Ben & Jerry's commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,"" said Ben & Jerry's Global Sustainability Manager Jenna Evans. ""It will reduce Vermont's road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease Phosphorous pollution.""

PurposeEnergy-St. Albans was built on land purchased from Franklin County Industrial Development Corporation and is expected to generate 8,750,000 kWh annually of renewable electricity exported to the Vermont grid under the state's Standard Offer program, which supports the deployment of small-scale renewable generation. Simultaneously, the facility recovers up to 45,000 million Btu annually of renewable thermal energy used to heat the digester and support facility operations.

""This facility represents a major step forward in sustainable infrastructure for food manufacturing in Vermont,"" said Erik Lallum, Chief Development Officer of PurposeEnergy. ""It's a model of industrial symbiosis—turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies.""

The presence of PurposeEnergy's industrial-scale waste treatment facility can support further food manufacturing investment and economic growth in the St. Albans Industrial Park and surrounding region by offering an on-site, sustainable solution for waste management and renewable energy recovery.

The Grand Opening marks the beginning of a new chapter in Vermont's clean energy and food manufacturing landscape, uniting public and private stakeholders in the shared mission of building a more sustainable future.

But Superfund sites often take decades to remediate, and several of those sites were removed thanks to work done during previous administrations.
EGLE’s Chris Svoboda has been involved with the Gelman site for about two years.
Citizens usually get involved in a Superfund site after it has been added to the National Priorities List, not before, he said.","Locals have been pushing for more aggressive solutions to the Gelman plume since a University of Michigan graduate student discovered it in 1984.

But Gelman is not required to clean up the plume. Instead, the state and Gelman manage the contamination through a decades-old legal agreement. Locals don’t have any direct input in what that looks like.

Advocates hoped that intervention from the U.S. EPA would bring the change they had been fighting for. But the agency’s future under Trump’s second administration is unclear.

After decades of trying to push for change from below, local officials and advocates want to leapfrog the state of Michigan and have the federal government take over management of the Gelman site of 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination on Ann Arbor's west side and Scio Township. But the Trump administration has been making changes to the Environmental Protection Agency that have advocates worried.

Washtenaw County Commissioner Yousef Rabhi is one of those advocates. He said the plume has been an important part of his career.

“I have seen government work for the people when it comes to this issue,” he said. “And I've seen government not work for the people when it comes to this issue.”

Pushing state officials for more aggressive cleanup has often been frustrating, said Kathy Knol, a trustee for Scio Township, where the plume originated.

“I feel I have a voice now, but it's taken years to get to this point,” she said. Knol has been a member of the township board since 2016.

She’s their contact for the Gelman plume, which originated at 600 S. Wagner Road just within the township’s boundaries. Knol has seen how local attempts to remediate the contamination have gained momentum — and stopped dead in their tracks.

Rabhi and Knol have spent the last year waiting for the EPA to announce whether the Gelman site will be added to the federal Superfund program. A decision was due this spring, but they’re still waiting.

The EPA is a better choice for a full cleanup because other remediation efforts have been “hamstrung” by the 1992 legal agreement between Gelman and the state, Rabhi said.

Local officials and advocates have little say in that agreement, which is supposed to hold Gelman accountable. The consent judgment — a court-supervised agreement reached to resolve a civil suit — represents a veritable brick wall for locals who feel the state isn’t adequately protecting their health.

A low trust factor

The agreement is the result of the state’s 1988 lawsuit against Gelman. It has endured for over three decades, through four amendments and three cleanup criteria changes.

It requires Gelman to manage the spread of dioxane in cooperation with the state’s environmental regulators. That includes pumping and treating groundwater to levels below 7.2 parts per billion (ppb), the state’s cleanup criterion for dioxane. But the company assumed no liability for the contamination.

The agreement serves as the agency’s enforcement tool against Gelman, said Chris Svoboda, the site’s project manager with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“We use that to keep [Gelman] in compliance,” he said. The consent judgment lays out Gelman’s responsibilities in great detail.

But a consent judgment limits the state’s regulatory and enforcement powers, said Andy Buchsbaum, an environmental law lecturer at the University of Michigan.

“The challenge with the consent judgment is it takes both parties to consent,” he said. “So you wind up with actions that may not be as protective as you'd want to see.”

As an equal party in negotiations, it’s harder for the state to compel Gelman to do something it doesn’t want to do.

For example, locals asked for more monitoring to track the plume in 2024, including testing more residential wells that aren’t officially part of the plume. The state declined to push for more funds from Gelman.

“We are in a stage where I think we have good cooperation with Gelman and their side,” Svoboda said. “And that has not always been the case. And I think that from the state’s perspective, it's a good thing to have this cooperative, collaborative relationship. EGLE making legal overtures like 'you need to pay more,' I don't necessarily know would be that conducive to keeping that relationship cooperative.""

From a resident’s perspective, that kind of agreement is hard to trust, Buchsbaum said.

“It'd be very difficult for anybody who's on the ground to trust an agreement agreed to by the perpetrator,” he said. “That doesn't mean necessarily it's a bad agreement, but it's just the trust factor would be very difficult to get unless you're part of the process.”

The result is an agreement that was never intended to clean up the contamination — just to contain it. That’s the main source of tension between advocates and state regulators, Svoboda said.

“We [EGLE] want to make sure people aren't exposed and people aren't harmed,” he said. “But unfortunately, the goal is not to completely remediate the aquifer.”

EGLE is following the consent judgment and doing its job, Svoboda said. He said that’s enough to protect the health of the community and the environment.

Rabhi and Knol don’t see it that way.

“They're arguing they are meeting our current requirements in Michigan, which is correct,” Knol said. “But it could be so much better.”

Rabhi was a bit more blunt.

“I would not consider that what they have been doing is actually protecting human health,” he said. But that’s because state regulators don’t have the tools they need to do it, he said.

“Because of the way that our state laws are structured, even our state agencies are not well equipped to actually protect the public on these issues,” he said.

But for advocates, that’s not enough. That’s why several local governments attempted to intervene in the latest round of negotiations between the state and Gelman.

But Gelman argued that the intervenors had no legal standing in negotiations and insisted that the process remain between the company and the state.

After several years of back and forth, an appellate court judge agreed. In 2022, the court ruled that the intervenors weren’t eligible to participate in that round of negotiations. The state and Gelman wrapped up the new consent judgment in spring of 2023 — without local input.

“It's often so important for the residents who are most affected to be part of whatever negotiations occur between the state and the perpetrator,” Buchsbaum said. “And that usually does not happen.”

“It is absurd to not stop the plume.”

At this point, Knol and Rabhi feel they’ll have better success with the federal government.

“I think many people believe that the best potential outcome we can get for this spreading contamination will come through [the Environmental Protection Agency],” Knol said.

Rabhi advocates for local officials to continue pushing for more action while appealing to federal regulators. But EPA intervention is preferable to the state’s current involvement, he said.

“The only way to take the chemicals out of the ground is to get the EPA involved, because [the state] has basically no ability to do it legally,” he said.

That’s been whistleblower Dan Bicknell’s solution for years.

“Gelman has not been managing the plume properly,” he said. “They've allowed the plume to expand into residential wells and they have no proper equipment to halt the plume and restore the aquifer to drinking water criteria.”

Bicknell discovered the contamination in 1984 and petitioned the county to test private wells near the Gelman site in 1985. A county official said at the time that Bicknell’s push for more testing was the only reason officials looked into the full extent of the contamination. Bicknell has stayed involved ever since.

“It is absurd to not stop the plume,” he said. Gelman is depriving the city of a clean water source by not cleaning it up, he said.

“You have a proper source of water in this pristine aquifer. You shouldn't allow it to be degraded,” he said. “You should allow it to be used in the future.”

The city currently relies heavily on Barton Pond, an impoundment of the Huron River, for drinking water. That’s already been polluted with PFAS, which the city has spent millions to filter out. Lack of clean groundwater increases costs for city residents and makes it harder for the city to provide clean drinking water, Rabhi said.

The plume hasn’t hit the pond, but the city has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars preparing for that possibility. Ann Arbor Water spent $200,000 to install additional monitoring wells and $50,000 on a facility plan study on dioxane. Quarterly testing of the pond for dioxane costs about $20,000 yearly, according to the city.

The EPA could remediate the aquifer back to usable condition, Bicknell said.

Superfund bound?

In March 2024, the EPA proposed adding the Gelman site to the National Priorities List, colloquially known as “Superfund.” The program identifies and remediates severely contaminated properties across the country. Federal law puts legal accountability for costs and cleanup on any party potentially responsible for contamination at the site. If no involved party is financially solvent, the federal government pays for it.

That’s not uncommon. Contaminated sites often find their way onto the list because they are “orphaned,” meaning the party or parties that owned the site no longer exist.

Gelman has been purchased by larger corporations twice in the past 30 years. Pall Life Sciences, now Pall Corporation, bought Gelman in 1997. Danaher, a multi-billion dollar life sciences corporation, bought Pall in 2015. None of the three companies responded to repeated requests for comment over email, phone and mail.

Gelman has argued that full cleanup of the aquifer isn’t feasible. The company maintains that the plume does not pose a threat to public health — because residents aren’t allowed to use the contaminated groundwater.

The EPA has assessed the Gelman site twice before, in 1986 and 2017. After the 2017 assessment, the EPA told local officials that the site was eligible for Superfund status. But to move forward, the EPA needs state buy-in.

Then-Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, declined to pursue EPA intervention. In 2021, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, requested the site be placed on the National Priorities List.

That’s why the site is finally being considered, said Erica Aultz, the National Priorities List coordinator for the site.

“The state of Michigan had decided that they feel that the EPA and their authorities [were] the best tool to address the contamination at this site,” she said. “It will not proceed to this point [of listing] without state support.”

Each site proposed for the list has a 90-day public comment period. That period closed in May 2024 for the Gelman site.

Since then, the EPA has been reviewing over 150 comments left by residents, local officials, advocacy groups and Gelman itself on the agency’s proposal to add the site to the list. The agency expected to issue a response to comments and a decision this spring, Aultz said.

But the EPA may have delayed Superfund listing decisions. That’s according to Joshua Mosher, Assistant Director of the Remediation and Redevelopment division at EGLE. EPA staff told him all listing decisions for spring 2024 had been delayed until the fall, he said at the March 2025 meeting of the Coalition for Action on Remediation of Dioxane (CARD).

“It’s nothing specific with Gelman, it’s the whole process,” he said at the meeting. “It’s all we know right now; any additions to the NPL are delayed right now.”

EGLE confirmed Mosher’s source was the EPA itself. But when we reached out to EPA to confirm, an agency spokesperson said they “[do] not have any information about a possible delay.”

Even if the site is listed, it’s unclear how the EPA will address advocates’ concerns. Spokespeople for the EPA could not make promises about how the program would address specific sites, including the plume.

And each stage of the National Priorities process can take years. Bicknell pointed out that’s in the cards for the Gelman plume regardless of who is managing the site.

“This is a long journey to get to a proper cleanup,” he said.

What would happen to the consent judgment?

Adding the site to the Superfund list would transfer enforcement responsibilities to the federal government. Advocates hope that stronger liability provisions in federal law would force Gelman to do more about the plume.

But it is unclear whether that would definitively override the consent judgment currently governing the site.

Bicknell is sure it would. Buchsbaum, the environmental lawyer, isn’t so sure. And neither are the state nor the EPA.

When asked what effect EPA intervention would have on the consent judgment, spokespeople for the EPA responded with the same answer that was found on the EPA’s FAQ for the site: “If the Gelman Sciences, Inc. site is listed on the [National Priorities List, NPL], at that time, EPA would become the lead enforcement agency and would coordinate with Michigan on how to smoothly transition the enforcement lead to EPA.”

That FAQ also said: “EPA has not taken a position on the specific terms of the consent judgment and cannot dictate its terms. If EPA pursues listing the site on the NPL, EPA will not require that the state court litigation end or the terms of the consent judgment be changed.”

The FAQ was removed in February 2025.

EGLE, the state’s environmental department, pointed to the state attorney general’s office, which works with Gelman to interpret and negotiate the consent judgment. The attorney general’s office declined to answer questions about the consent judgment’s future under the EPA. The office then pointed us back to EGLE and the EPA.

If the site is approved, anyone who commented on the listing proposal has 90 days to legally contest the EPA’s decision, Aultz said at the June 2024 coalition meeting. That includes Gelman. But that wouldn’t stop the process from moving forward, the EPA confirmed.

EPA under Trump's second term

It’s also unclear how the Superfund program as a whole will fare under a second Trump presidency. Advocates worry the delay is the result of changing priorities at the agency.

The President is committed to cleaning up polluted sites, the EPA said in a statement in February. A spokesperson cited the number of sites deleted from the Superfund list during Trump’s first term.

Deleting a site from the list is the penultimate stage of the Superfund process, when the agency determines if the site is safe enough for reuse.

But Superfund sites often take decades to remediate, and several of those sites were removed thanks to work done during previous administrations. And previous administrations didn’t measure success by counting deletions.

While the EPA under then-Trump appointee Scott Pruitt did push for cleanup at some sites, those tended to be sites ideal for redevelopment, rather than the most toxic sites.

And by the end of Trump’s first term, Superfund sites languished due to lack of funding, creating the largest backlog of sites ready for cleanup but without funding in 15 years. Trump then proposed cutting the EPA’s funding by 26% in 2020.

Project 2025 suggests the EPA should focus on “short-term cleanups” and prioritize “economic opportunities” that remediation could bring. The plan also suggests revisiting emerging contaminants like PFAS and allowing potentially responsible parties to conduct their own five-year reviews of Superfund cleanups.

Plus, there’s concern the administration could cut staff at the Region 5 office, which oversees Michigan’s Superfund sites. In late February, Trump said the EPA would be cutting 65% of its staff. But he didn’t provide specifics about which departments or regions would be affected. Later, the White House said instead, the EPA budget would be cut by 65%.

When asked to confirm, the EPA directed Michigan Public to the White House. When asked for details, the White House referred Michigan Public back to the EPA.

The prospect of a weaker EPA has advocates worried.

Rita Loch-Caruso, professor emeritus of toxicology at the University of Michigan, said she trusts EPA staff — but not the Trump administration officials running the agency.

“It's hard to feel optimistic when the EPA administrator just is effusive about cutting regulations,” she said. Loch-Caruso is also a board member of CARD.

In a statement, the EPA said Zeldin was committed “to the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Marianne Martin, who lives in a neighborhood where drinking water was contaminated with Gelman’s dioxane in the 1980s, said she doesn’t believe the Trump administration.

“I don't trust one minute of what [Trump’s] doing,” she said. She’s concerned cuts to the EPA could mean the end of the Superfund program.

“Without that, and without the push to make [the EPA] more effective, it's going to be a lot more neighborhoods like this all over,” Martin said.

The path forward

While local groups haven’t had much luck, government officials credit advocates like CARD and Dan Bicknell.

EGLE’s Chris Svoboda has been involved with the Gelman site for about two years. He said organizations like the coalition have made a difference.

“In my time here, the citizen advocates have definitely been a strong force for progress and getting things done,” he said. “I really think that they've had a huge impact throughout the whole course of the project.”

That’s unusual for a site that hasn’t been designated a Superfund site yet, said Anthony Mcglown, the EPA remedial project manager for the site.

“A really unique aspect of this site is just the community involvement that's been around this site for decades prior to EPA's involvement,” he said. Citizens usually get involved in a Superfund site after it has been added to the National Priorities List, not before, he said.

The EPA would continue tapping into that energy with a community involvement plan, Mcglown said. It’s part of the Superfund process.

“Those are tailored specifically to that site and that community,” Mcglown said. “And the important key first task in development of that plan is to go out and conduct community interviews to get the community feedback on how they would like us to engage.”

While EPA intervention is the best bet for the Gelman site, the state still needs to address the wider problem of industrial contamination, Rabhi said.

“We're not unique in the state in terms of problems like this,” he said. There are over 18,000 contaminated sites in Michigan (Gelman is one of them).

That’s thanks to the state’s history of heavy manufacturing. State environmental laws are woefully under-equipped to protect the public, advocates have argued.

In late 2024, a package of bills that would overhaul Michigan’s pollution cleanup regulations failed to pass the state House even though Democrats held a majority. The bill’s sponsors hope to continue negotiating with industry stakeholders and environmental groups this year, said State Senator Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor.

“I'm hopeful that we can reintroduce those bills pretty soon here, based on the progress and the trajectory that we had last fall,” he said. But Republican control of the House represents a potential “headwind,” Irwin said.

Rabhi is less optimistic about the legislation, but said he isn’t giving up. He wants to change how the government approaches regulating chemicals, especially emerging contaminants like dioxane.

“We should assume the worst,” Rabhi said. “We should assume that they're poisonous to us, until we can prove that they're not.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eac5fbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+450/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2Fe8%2F749ded8c4aa280a9ba2e8017e59a%2Fpsx-20250523-124314.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:14:03.383686

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle maker Rivian achieved its second consecutive quarterly gross profit in Q2, which triggered a $1 billion cash infusion from partner Volkswagen Group, CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said during a call with analysts May 6.

The funds, which executives expect to receive by the end of June, will aid Rivian in deploying its technology and software stack to a wide array of vehicles by capitalizing on VW’s scale as it pushes for broader EV adoption, according to Scaringe.

“The relationship there continues to progress really well,” Scaringe said of the partnership. “At this point, we're very focused on executing a lot of programs across the Volkswagen Group.”

Dive Insight:

In addition to financial support from VW, Rivian’s efforts to scale production has also been bolstered by a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan finalized in January to revive the company’s stalled Georgia EV factory project, which is expected to start production by 2028.

The company is also investing $120 million in Normal, Illinois, where it is constructing a supplier park meant to create an electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem next to its production plant where it is building the R2 SUV.

However, like other automakers, Rivian also faces tariff-fueled headwinds necessitating plans to offset higher duties on automotive parts, especially battery components.

CFO Claire McDonough said on the call that the company expected “per unit direct impact from tariffs to be a couple thousand dollars for 2025 based off of the currently announced tariffs in place.”

Rivian’s chief concern is rising cost for battery materials. McDonough said while the company’s stockpile of batteries is sufficient to carry its production through early 2026, it continues to monitor export restrictions on rare earth minerals from China.

“We are actively monitoring these developments and working to mitigate potential risks through a variety of initiatives, including strategic sourcing and proactive engagement with policymakers,” she said.

Higher component costs due to tariffs moved Rivian to raise its capital expenditure guidance to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Uncertainty fueled by economic policies also led the company to revise its delivery outlook to 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, down from 46,000 to 51,000 announced April 2.

Agency officials said they haven’t yet had a chance to study the Supreme Court’s decision, and so it is unclear what the ruling’s impact will be, if any.
Surface Transportation Board, which produced 3,600 pages of analysis on the potential impact.
Seven counties that favored the development appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the potential environmental impact should be limited to the building of the railroad itself.
“The board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects,” he said.","The Supreme Court on Thursday sharply limited the reach of environmental impact statements in a victory for developers.

In an 8-0 decision, the justices said these claims of the potential impact on the environment have been used too often to delay or block new projects.

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development under the guise of just a little more process. A course correction of sorts is appropriate,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, speaking for the court.

He said judges and environmentalists have been given too much authority to hinder development.

“Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary,” he said. “And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.”

The decision could loom large in California and the West because the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has taken a broad view of environmental protection and the scope of impact statements.

“Today’s decision undermines decades of legal precedent that told federal agencies to look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment,” said Earthjustice Vice President Sam Sankar. “The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.”

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, described the court’s ruling as a “disastrous decision” that will undermine the nation’s bedrock environmental laws, ultimately resulting in more pollution and greater threats to public health.

“It guarantees that bureaucrats can put their heads in the sand and ignore the harm federal projects will cause to ecosystems, wildlife, and the climate,” Park said in a statement.

But Dan Wolff, an administrative law attorney with the D.C.-based firm Crowell & Moring, said he believes the Supreme Court’s decision is a reasonable interpretation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, or NEPA, and exercise of the court’s authority.

Over the decades, NEPA has ballooned from a straightforward reporting process into a lengthy rabbit hole of bureaucracy, he said. The court’s decision is intended to remind lower courts that that’s not what NEPA provides for.

The American Petroleum Institute welcomed the ruling.

“Today, the Supreme Court took long overdue steps to restore NEPA to its original intent and ensure a broken permitting process doesn’t stand in the way of American oil and natural gas production,” said its general counsel, Ryan Meyers. “This unanimous ruling underscores how NEPA has been weaponized by activists to block U.S. infrastructure of all kinds at the expense of American workers and consumers.”

The decision could have ramifications for major projects in California, including the high-speed rail — the largest public infrastructure project in the country — which will connect San Francisco to Anaheim. The majority of the project’s first phase has already cleared state and federal environmental review, according to the High-Speed Rail Authority.

But its last segment, which will link Los Angeles to Anaheim, has yet to undergo NEPA or the state’s equivalent known as the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA. Phase 2 of the project, which is still many years away but would eventually extend the system to connect Merced to Sacramento and Los Angeles to San Diego, also has yet to undergo the reviews.

Agency officials said they haven’t yet had a chance to study the Supreme Court’s decision, and so it is unclear what the ruling’s impact will be, if any.

The same is true for the Delta Conveyance Project — a proposed $20-billion tunnel that would move water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to cities and farmlands to the south that is undergoing NEPA review. Opponents of the controversial project have vowed to block the tunnel over concerns that it would harm the environment, fish species and local communities.

NEPA was the first of a series of landmark environmental laws. It required federal agencies to prepare a report assessing the likely impact of projects that will be funded or approved by the government.

NEPA has roots in California, where a 1969 oil spill off the coast helped spark the modern environmental movement. The spill, which occurred as Congress was drafting NEPA regulations, generated significant public outrage and helped galvanize national support for federal environmental protection laws.

But Kavanaugh said the “purely procedure law” of 1970 has been turned into “a substantive roadblock. ... The goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it.”

In Thursday’s unanimous decision, the high court ruled for the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in northeastern Utah, a spur line that could carry crude oil that would be refined along the Gulf Coast.

The project needed the approval of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, which produced 3,600 pages of analysis on the potential impact.

In blocking the proposal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals cited its potential to spur more drilling for oil in Utah and more pollution along the Gulf Coast. The judges said these “upstream” and “downstream” impacts of the railroad must be considered before the new rail line is approved.

Seven counties that favored the development appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the potential environmental impact should be limited to the building of the railroad itself.

Kavanaugh and the court agreed. “The board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects,” he said.

The court’s three liberals — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — concurred in the decision but did not sign on to Kavanaugh’s opinion. They agreed with the narrow focus on the project itself, but they did not join the criticism of judges.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a Colorado native who is friends with some of the leading developers, did not participate in the decision.

Sections of the rail line would run along the Colorado River.

Colorado Atty. Gen. Phil Weiser called the proposed railroad a “risky scheme to transport waxy crude oil along the Colorado River, right alongside our most critical water resource and posing major risks to Colorado’s Western Slope communities.”

Supporters of the project were celebrating.

“This decision affirms the years of work and collaboration that have gone into making the Uinta Basin Railway a reality,” said Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition. It “represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9bb63de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4559x2393+0+323/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2Fb3%2Fce176b734122b953c1692e6e9849%2Fsupreme-court-utah-oil-railway-63602.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:51.990486

Critics of the ruling are worried about increased oil extraction in Utah as well as additional refining in Gulf of Mexico communities.
""Our bedrock environmental laws, like NEPA, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters.""
""The last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want.""","In a 8-0 ruling on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court not only reversed a block on a proposed oil train in Utah but also narrowed a landmark federal environmental law, sparking intense alarm about what the ruling will mean for communities and all living things across the country.

""Today's decision undermines decades of legal precedent that told federal agencies to look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment,"" said Earthjustice senior vice president of program Sam Sankar in a statement. ""The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.""

Since the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law in 1970 by Republican then-President Richard Nixon, it has become a key target for GOP policymakers aligned with the planet-wrecking fossil fuel industry, including President Donald Trump, who swiftly took aim at the law after returning to office in January.

""We urgently need to strengthen laws like NEPA, not weaken or narrow them, so that we can prioritize the health of people over polluters and corporate greed.""

NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for certain infrastructure projects. In 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit tossed both an EIS for the proposed Uinta Basin Railway and the U. S. Surface Transportation Board's approval of the project, which would connect Utah's oil fields to the national rail network.

After hearing arguments for Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County in December, the nation's highest court reversed that decision on Thursday, continuing a trend of rulings slammed by environmentalists as gifts to corporate polluters.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself without explanation. Politiconoted that ""it followed a public pressure campaign from environmental groups and Democrats who argued his close connections to the owner of oil and gas producer Anschutz—which filed a brief in the case saying NEPA's scope was critical to developing oil and gas reserves—disqualified him.""

Justice Brett Kavanagh delivered the opinion, joined by the other right-wingers who participated in the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion, joined by the other two liberals.

Kavanaugh wrote for the majority that ""the D. C. Circuit failed to afford the board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases and incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the board to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place from the Uinta Basin Railway.""

Environmental and public health advocates were quick to warn of the impacts of not only this 88-mile rail project, if completed, but also the decision more broadly.

""This decision is terrible news for the entire Colorado River Basin,"" said John Weisheit, conservation director at Living Rivers. ""To avoid the pending collapse of the Colorado River, we have to immediately reduce water consumption by 25% and cut carbon emissions by 50% by the end of this decade. Our federal decision-makers must deny any project that counters these objectives. The Uinta Basin Railway unquestionably falls into that category and should never see the light of day.""

Critics of the ruling are worried about increased oil extraction in Utah as well as additional refining in Gulf of Mexico communities.

""Regrettably, the Supreme Court has scored one for the oil companies who don't want you to look too closely at the harm their product will do to Black and Brown communities in Cancer Alley,"" said Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff. ""Our bedrock environmental laws, like NEPA, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters.""

""Fossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution,"" Shoaff stressed.

""The last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want.""

Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney Wendy Park declared that ""the last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want,"" and vowed to ""keep fighting to make sure this railway is never built.""

Park also looked beyond the train project, warning that ""this disastrous decision to undermine our nation's bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy.""

WildEarth Guardians staff attorney Katherine Merlin similarly emphasized that ""today's decision is a devastating loss for our wild places, our wild rivers, and for all of the human and nonhuman communities that depend on a clean environment and stable climate.""

The ruling comes as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are working to boost planet-heating fossil fuels, ignoring scientists' warnings about the worsening climate emergency.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60341384&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C176%2C0%2C177,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:56.188176

In other words, they only kick in for community groups trying to identify illegal levels of air pollution.
Those prohibitive costs are, in a way, the reason community air monitoring programs exist in the first place.
A law passed earlier this year in Kentucky limits community air monitoring data in rulemaking, but does not attempt to stymie the public sharing of that data.
The plaintiffs want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the state attorney general’s office to be barred from enforcing CAMRA.","For several years, Amy Stelly has been partnering with the Louisiana State University School of Public Health in New Orleans to monitor air quality next to the Claiborne Expressway, a busy highway that runs northwest of the city’s iconic French Quarter.

At a community meeting in April, Stelly, who runs an organization called the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, was excited to unveil some of this data in a new interactive tool on the alliance’s website. People would be able to see hot spots for particulate matter — a pollutant generated by heavy traffic and associated with health risks like heart attacks and aggravated asthma — near their homes, schools, and workplaces. The data would support her push for the expressway’s removal and could be used by other neighborhood groups to advocate against highway expansion.

But the data on her website was short-lived. Stelly had her webmaster remove it soon after the community meeting. She had gotten wind of a 2024 state law that made it illegal to share air pollution data generated from technologies not approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Violations could incur hefty fines of up to $32,500 a day, with violations done “intentionally, willfully, or knowingly” racking up an additional $1 million.

“It just didn’t make sense to do a big push, given the fact that we were violating the law by even having a meeting,” Stelly said. “I can’t afford $32,500 a day. I don’t have that, nor do I have the million dollars. So it just seemed more prudent to remain quiet for a while.”

The Claiborne Avenue Alliance is part of a coalition of neighborhood and environmental groups that sued Louisiana regulators last week over the state’s Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA. The 2024 law was ostensibly meant to standardize community-based air monitoring programs throughout Louisiana, many of which had recently expanded thanks to funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But the community groups — including The Concerned Citizens of St. John; The Descendants Project; Jefferson, Orleans, Irish Channel Neighbors for Clean Air; Micah 6:8 Mission; and Rise St. James; along with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio — said the law is a de facto ban on the dissemination of their research and a violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech.

“It’s pretty mind-boggling,” Stelly said.

CAMRA was backed by petrochemical industry trade associations. It essentially says that if community groups want to monitor air pollution and share their data with the public, they have to use “an [EPA]-approved or promulgated emission test or monitoring method,” based on the pollutant being monitored. CAMRA’s requirements only apply to monitoring “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance” with federal, state, or local air quality laws. In other words, they only kick in for community groups trying to identify illegal levels of air pollution.

Pollutants covered by CAMRA include six federally regulated “criteria air pollutants” (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide), 188 federally regulated “hazardous air pollutants,” and 14 “toxic air pollutants” regulated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

According to a Louisiana DEQ study from earlier this year, regulatory-grade monitors for these pollutants costs more than $791,000 each, plus up to $200,000 more for annual maintenance and operations. Those prohibitive costs are, in a way, the reason community air monitoring programs exist in the first place. By using less expensive equipment, they’re able to deploy air monitors in places that would otherwise not be covered by the EPA’s reference monitors and the 27 air monitoring sites within the National Air Toxics Trends Station Network.

“There is no need for these groups to spend $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 on equipment when in fact there is equipment that, for $200 or less, will give you perfectly adequate results for you to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they’re breathing is safe,” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, at a press conference last week.

Cynthia Roberts, executive director of the nonprofit Micah 6:8 Mission — one of the groups that brought the lawsuit — told reporters that CAMRA “is not about protecting public health or ensuring good science. It’s about silencing communities like mine.” She said her organization’s air monitors near a Westlake Chemical complex in Sulphur, Louisiana, have frequently shown particulate matter concentrations higher than what the EPA considers unhealthy. Roberts used to post this information on Facebook. But now, she said, “simply posting that kind of data could cost us $32,500 per day.”

“That’s not just chilling,” she added. “That’s censorship, and it’s dangerous.”

None of the community groups that brought the lawsuit has been fined since CAMRA was enacted last year, but their leaders say the law has obstructed their work. Caitlion Hunter, research and policy coordinator for Rise St. James, said community air monitoring has been critical along the 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River dubbed “Cancer Alley” due to its density of petrochemical facilities and elevated cancer rate. People rely on her organization’s data, she said, because federal regulators have failed to monitor for ethylene oxide, a human carcinogen. Joy Banner, who co-directs The Descendants Project, said she “put a pause” on a planned program to publicize data from her nonprofit’s air quality monitors in St. John the Baptist Parish, in the heart of Cancer Alley.

CAMRA is “scaring us away from being able to share the data with our community members who need it the most,” Banner said at the press conference.

Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is representing the community groups alongside the Environmental Integrity Project, told Grist that CAMRA violates Louisianans’ First Amendment rights to free speech in three ways: First, it seeks to broadly regulate any “allegations” made against polluters — even if those allegations are made in an informal context, rather than in court. Second, it includes a provision requiring “quality assurance certifications” to be published alongside certain air pollution analyses, even though it doesn’t say what those certifications are. And third, it requires that any air pollution-related communications come with “clear explanations” of the data interpretation and any relevant uncertainties. Joshi described this as compelled speech — an “obvious” First Amendment violation — and said it wasn’t clear what the regulators would consider to be a sufficient explanation.

“It’s rare these days to see something so directly regulating speech,” Joshi said. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a similar bill last year, but it died in the state senate. A law passed earlier this year in Kentucky limits community air monitoring data in rulemaking, but does not attempt to stymie the public sharing of that data.

The Louisiana community groups’ lawsuit also argues that CAMRA violates their First Amendment “right to petition” — to use their air monitoring data when asking the Department of Environmental Quality or the EPA to step in when clean air laws have been violated. A third claim says CAMRA is in conflict with the Clean Air Act and the EPA’s efforts under the Inflation Reduction Act to promote the use of community air sensors. The plaintiffs want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the state attorney general’s office to be barred from enforcing CAMRA.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment. The state’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, told Grist, “I’m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs ‘violates their constitutional rights.’ But we’ll defend the lawsuit.”

Stelly, with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, said she and her colleagues have found themselves in a confounding situation. In many cases, they obtained air sensors through EPA grants — but now they’re being told that those sensors are insufficient. For Stelly specifically, her grant and partnership with Louisiana State University will eventually require her to submit a written report on the data she’s collected, even though CAMRA suggests such a report could be illegal.

CAMRA “will force us into a position of noncompliance if we cannot provide that written report with that data,” she said. “It’s very weird.”

Clean Energy Generation

A community is a group of people who share common characteristics, interests, or goals, fostering a sense of belonging and shared identity. When SACE started the #Clean Energy Generation (CEG), it was our way of creating and supporting a community of people across all ‘generations’ working together to build a future powered by clean energy. CEG members are using our collective power to accelerate the transition as we pivot away from polluting fossil fuels to a future that is safe, healthy, and protects the people and places we love most.

As it turns out, lots of Southeasterners are heeding the call to join and take action. World Asthma Day on May 6, 2025, provided a great opportunity to educate, engage, and demonstrate that collective action is powerful!

Plugging into the Electric School Bus Effort

SACE is a proud member of the Alliance for Electric School Buses, a national consortium of non-profit organizations committed to transitioning our nation’s fleet of school buses to electric. This year, to honor World Asthma Day, the Alliance created a call to action to show support for continuing federal funding for clean electric school buses. This nationwide effort generated thousands of handwritten postcards and digital signatures in support of clean school buses.

Electric School Buses Offer One Asthma Solution

Clean, electric buses provide significant health benefits for children, particularly those with asthma. Studies have shown that reducing exposure to diesel exhaust by transitioning to zero-emission electric school buses can reduce asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses, and school absences. Diesel exhaust pollution is harmful for everyone, but is especially bad for kids as their lungs are developing.

At Earth Day events throughout our region in April, several members of the Clean Energy Generation spoke to friends, neighbors, and community members about the benefits of electric school buses. We helped make the connection between cleaner air associated with driving zero-emission electric school buses that lack a tailpipe. We educated members of our community about the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program, and the $5 billion in federal funding that was allocated for it through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Many of the people my colleague Janet and I spoke with at the Savannah Earth Day event had no idea that Georgia has 124 and Florida has 219 electric school buses safely transporting students to school. Some folks were also surprised to learn that Bluebird and Thomas Built buses are made by American workers in Georgia and North Carolina, respectively.

Turning Awareness into Action

After talking with community members, we asked them to take action in support of clean school buses via signing a digital letter that would be sent to their federal senators and representative or to hand write a postcard to one of their state senators, urging them to continue funding for these buses during the federal budget reconciliation process.

Kay Hudson, with the League of Women Voters (LWV) of Orange County, collected postcards at Orlando’s Earth Day event.

Scott Presson is a clean energy volunteer with the Sierra Club Georgia Chapter and encouraged his chapter to collect postcards.

Sara Vinson, co-founder of Sustainable Newton, collected postcards at the Cheerios Challenge/Earth Day Celebration on April 19th in Covington, Georgia.

Maxine Connor, Natural Resources Chair of the League of Women Voters of Citrus County, Co-Chair and co-chair of the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team, collected postcards at the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team table at the Earth Day Expo at the Extension office in Citrus County, FL on Saturday, April 26. Maxine is also the Natural Resources Chair of the League of Women Voters of Citrus County.

Rhudine Rush-Steele and friend Laura Bastarach called friends & canvassed to help collect postcards. The picture is at a goat yoga class held in their local park every year.

Mary Dipboye (not pictured) collected postcards through her work with the First Unitarian Church of Orlando. She is the co-chair of their Green Team.

Culmination of Day of Action

After collecting hundreds of postcards and virtual signatures in support of funding for clean school buses, SACE was proud to team up with partner advocacy organizations of the Alliance for Electric School Buses in both Georgia and Florida to deliver them to elected officials on World Asthma Day for a Day of Action.

In Georgia, SACE, Moms Clean Air Force and Climate Action Campaign delivered letters to Senator Jon Ossoff’s Atlanta office. We were joined by advocate Ramsey Nix, who wrote about the experience, and her two children.

In Florida, Lorna Perez, Florida Field Consultant and Sarah McBride, communications specialist, with Moms Clean Air Force, along with Karen Freedman, co-chair of the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team, delivered them to Senator Rick Scott’s office in Tampa (X Video).

At Senator Ossoff’s office, we were able to meet with staff and thank them for the Senator’s support of clean school bus funding. At Senator Scott’s office, it was an opportunity to explain all the reasons why he should.

Both Day of Action events demonstrate how impactful CEG members can be in energizing their communities. They act as weavers, gathering together their community members and then connecting their collective action to the leaders who make decisions on behalf of their community.

Rubin, trends in global engineering, corporate business",,,,,https://www.enr.com/articles/60812-trump-admin-pushes-rule-to-reverse-mandate-to-cut-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions,"The Trump administration announced several new actions in recent days to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S., particularly from coal-fired plants.
“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters.
It said the draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, and cutting the emissions would have no “meaningful effect” on public health.
But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in the level of polluting power plant emissions.
They also expressed concern it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.","The Trump administration announced several new actions in recent days to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S., particularly from coal-fired plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed to media on May 24 that it is drafting a proposed regulation to eliminate all current restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, set to be published in the Federal Register after federal agencies' review.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had said in a March press release announcing the agency's intention to review the Biden administration's power plant regulations. “Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters. “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

The use of coal power has been on the decline in the U.S. since 2005 and is more expensive to operate than wind or solar energy—before factoring in the Biden-era emissions reduction rules.

The confirmation came several days after the New York Times had reported the plans, based on sources and review of internal EPA documents.

It said the draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, and cutting the emissions would have no “meaningful effect” on public health. The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the U.S. has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, down from representing 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule. But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in the level of polluting power plant emissions.

EPA released no further details of the draft rule but said it could be released in June, theTimes reported, also speculating that it could be finalized by end of the year, “an extraordinarily fast pace.”

Supporters are optimistic, but other observers expect the rule to face lawsuits if it becomes final. They also expressed concern it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.

“It is a good step forward in line with the rule of law,” Thomas Pyle, president of oil and gas advocacy group American Energy Alliance, told the Washington Post. But Vickie Patton, Environmental Defense Fund general counsel said “fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,” calling the proposed rule “an abuse of [EPA] responsibility under the law. ... that flies in the face of common sense.”

'Emergency Order'

The EPA news came a day after an “emergency order” from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to prevent the planned May 31 shutdown of the 1.56-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., by grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Michigan utility Consumers Energy, which DOE said “is 15 years before the end of its scheduled design life.” Wright said the action, set to last until Aug. 21, is authorized under the Federal Power Act and “is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency.”

Michigan utility regulators called the federal order “unnecessary” and noted there was no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region. Katie Carey, a Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that the utility “plans to comply with the 90-day pause. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration moved May 22 to support a lawsuit by Texas and 12 other states against large private infrastructure investors Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advsors, claiming they conspired to reduce competition in the U.S. coal sector, which risks undermining the federal goal of domestic energy independence. The U.S. Justice Dept. and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case that State Street called “baseless.”

President Donald Trump also signed four executive orders for a faster buildout of U.S. nuclear power plants, including a directive for the Energy and Defense Departments to build reactors at military bases, on federal lands and sited near data centers.

The orders also seek strategies for how reactors could be constructed without approval of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and sets a goal to increase U.S. nuclear power generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up fourfold from the current 100 GW level that comes from the output of more than than 90 operating reactors.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/05/29/CAMPBELL-COALPLANTCONSUMERS-ENERGY.jpg?height=635&t=1748548795&width=1200,N,,2025-05-29 17:11:35.527621

Last week, the House narrowly passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” and proposed terminating most of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which had tax incentives for producers of so called “clean energy” sources such as wind and solar.

The revised GOP bill offers renewed support for mining, drilling., and other traditional energy production including nuclear power.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D (residential solar systems) and 48e (commercial and utility projects). This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth,” Tesla Energy, the company’s solar and battery division, posted on its official X account Wednesday.

Tesla’s energy subsidiary has seen quiet but steady growth over the years, becoming more relatively profitable that the more well-known automotive division. In 2024 the company boasted a more than a 50% growth, far outpacing Tesla’s other divisions.

Although the bill has yet to pass the Senate, the GOP’s disincentivizing of clean energy manufacturing could slice into one of the fastest growing sectors of Musk’s empire.

Musk later posted: “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

Musk had previously stated that he opposed government subsides of any kind, posting in November just after Trump’s election: “In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.”

The posts come hours after Musk announced he was leaving his government advisory position as the head the Department of Government Efficiency to return full-time to running his various businesses. Upon leaving, Musk lamented that his work at DOGE didn’t result in any meaningful government cutbacks after viewing the GOP’s proposed bill.

“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said.

The bill phases out incentives that drive investment, create jobs, and support Michigan’s net-zero carbon target by 2050.

Stricter supply chain mandates targeting foreign ties may hinder innovation, raise prices, and disrupt local manufacturers.

Economic forecasts predict billions in lost output and a potential 10% rise in electricity bills for Michigan residents by 2035.

The legislation could stall or halt many clean energy projects, threatening both environmental and economic goals.

The final outcome depends on Senate decisions and high-stakes political negotiations ahead.

The rolling farmlands and lake-studded skyline of Michigan have become unexpected battlegrounds in the nationwide fight for clean energy—now threatened by freshly passed legislation in the U.S. House. Supporters of clean energy describe the budget reconciliation bill as a decisive blow to Michigan’s growing climate leadership, warning that its aggressive rollback of federal tax credits could derail years of progress and put billions in economic gains on the line.

Under the current framework, Michigan’s solar and wind turbines spin steadily, buoyed by federal and state incentives. Those credits drive investment, create jobs, and power a slow but sure surge toward the state’s declared net-zero carbon goal by 2050. But the new bill signals an abrupt shift: it phases out these critical tax benefits for both industrial-scale clean energy projects and homegrown efforts. By the end of 2025, families installing solar panels or buying electric vehicles would lose federal tax advantages, shutting doors to many who hoped to transition to greener choices.

The ramifications go deeper. Manufacturers would suddenly face strict mandates to trace their supply chains for any hint of foreign ties—especially to China or Russia—a process described by energy advocates as arduous at best and “virtually impossible” for many companies. Such requirements could stifle innovation, stall new projects, and drive up prices across the board. Studies estimate that by 2035, Michigan’s economic output would shrink by several billion dollars, consumers could see electricity bills spike by 10%, and the once-crowded pipeline of clean energy projects could dry up almost overnight.

Without robust federal backing, Michigan’s vision of a carbon-free future dims. The state, which has pledged to slash the lion’s share of CO2 emissions by 2050 and rely on cutting-edge carbon-removal technologies, faces a steeper climb. The urgency is real. Climate science warns that delayed action means more floods along Lake Michigan, more droughts across the mitten-shaped state, and severe weather that could rattle both local economies and everyday lives.

The recent vote illuminates deep fault lines in U.S. climate policy. While some Republican leaders label the measure as a tool to cut “wasteful spending,” clean energy proponents counter that the true cost will be shouldered by workers, families, and Michigan’s environment. The debate isn’t over: the U.S. Senate must still weigh in, and August’s looming debt ceiling deadline raises the political stakes even higher.

Every piece of legislation shapes the future in quiet but profound ways. As Michigan stands at a crossroads—risking its clean energy momentum—the core question echoes far beyond state lines: Will America continue to invest in a greener, more resilient economy, or step back just as the world’s climate clock ticks ever faster?

Bottom line: Federal policies matter more than headlines suggest. If the bill becomes law, Michigan may trade its ambitious energy goals for economic uncertainty and higher costs. The coming months will show whether the state—and the nation—chooses to power forward or hit pause on the clean energy revolution.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court backed a multibillion-dollar oil railroad expansion in Utah Thursday in a ruling that scales back a key environmental law and could accelerate development projects around the country.

The 8-0 decision comes after an appeal to the high court from backers of the project, which is aimed at quadrupling oil production in the remote area of sandstone and sagebrush.

Environmental groups said the decision would have sweeping impacts on National Environmental Policy Act reviews. President Donald Trump's administration has already said it's speeding up that process after the president in January declared a “national energy emergency” and vowed to boost U.S. oil and gas development.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh referred to the decision as a “course correction"" in an opinion fully joined by four conservative colleagues.

“Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects,” he wrote. The three liberal justices agreed the Utah project should get its approval, but they would have taken a narrower path.

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-kilometer) expansion that would connect the oil-rich region of northeast Utah to the national rail network, allowing oil and gas producers to access larger markets. The state's crude oil production was valued at $4.1 billion in 2024, according to a Utah Geological Survey report, and could increase substantially under the expansion project.

The justices reversed a lower court decision and restored a critical approval from federal regulators on the Surface Transportation Board.

Construction, though, does not appear to be imminent. Project leaders must obtain several permits and secure necessary financing with private-sector partners before they can break ground, said Uinta Basin Railway spokesperson Melissa Cano.

Environmental groups and a Colorado county had argued that regulators must consider a broad range of potential impacts when they consider new development, such as increased wildfire risk, the effect of additional crude oil production from the area and increased refining in Gulf Coast states.

The justices, though, found that regulators were right to consider the direct effects of the project, rather than the wider upstream and downstream impact. Kavanaugh wrote that courts should defer to regulators on “where to draw the line” on what factors to take into account. “The goal of the law is to inform agency decision making, not to paralyze it,” he said.

The court’s conservative majority court has taken steps to curtail the power of federal regulators in other cases, however, including striking down the decades-old Chevron doctrine that made it easier for the federal government to set a wide range of regulations.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a concurrence that the court could have simply cleared the way for the railway approval by saying that regulators did not need to consider increased fossil fuel production tied to the project.

Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case after facing calls to step aside over ties to Philip Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire whose ownership of oil wells in the area means he could benefit if the project goes through. Gorsuch, as a lawyer in private practice, had represented Anschutz.

The ruling comes after Trump’s vow to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from former President Joe Biden’s focus on climate change. The administration announced last month it’s speeding up environmental reviews of projects required under the same law at the center of the Utah case, compressing a process that typically takes a year or more into just weeks.

“The court's decision gives agencies a green light to ignore the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their decisions and avoid confronting them,” said Sambhav Sankar, senior vice president of programs at Earthjustice.

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said opponents would continue to fight the Utah project. “This disastrous decision to undermine our nation’s bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy,"" she said.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the ruling affirms a “balanced approach” to environmental oversight. He praised the railroad expansion as a critical infrastructure project that will help “restore America’s energy independence” and bolster the state's rural economy.

James Coleman, a professor at University of Minnesota Law School, said the ruling is an “important corrective"" that would have judges deferring to federal regulators rather than requiring them to consider upstream and downstream effects of energy transportation projects.

The project’s public partner also applauded the ruling. “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability,"" said Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition.

Inside a sprawling manufacturing facility, workers are building batteries that will power 130,000 homes — part of a broader economic renaissance reshaping the commonwealth’s industrial landscape. Through strategic federal investments in clean energy and manufacturing, Pennsylvania is witnessing the creation of thousands of jobs while positioning itself at the forefront of tomorrow’s clean energy economy. This transformation isn’t just about environmental progress — it’s about building a stronger, more resilient economic future for Pennsylvania’s workers and families.

At the heart of this revolution is Eos Energy Enterprises, where a $303.5 million federal loan guarantee is fueling an ambitious expansion. The company isn’t just creating jobs — it’s cultivating careers. Through its innovative Clean Energy Careers Program, Eos is partnering with local high schools and trade schools to develop the skilled workforce needed for tomorrow. This forward-thinking approach ensures that economic benefits flow directly into local communities, creating sustainable career pathways for residents.

The impact of this clean energy transformation extends far beyond single facilities or communities. A new study, “If You Fund It, They Will Come,” recently released by ReImagine Appalachia and the Keystone Research Center, reveals how wide-reaching these investments have been. Between 2022 and 2024, after the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act were in place, $9.8 billion in clean energy investments have come to Pennsylvania, the majority of which were private dollars, spurred by public investments. And these investments are bridging political divides. Since early 2022, communities in both Democratic and Republican congressional districts have attracted substantial clean energy investments, demonstrating that economic progress can unite rather than divide.

Pennsylvania’s success story is rooted in its ability to leverage its rich industrial heritage for clean energy innovation. Investment patterns show a remarkable balance between urban and rural communities, with particular momentum in regions traditionally dependent on conventional energy production. This equitable distribution ensures the clean energy transition lifts all communities, leaving no one behind.

The transformation runs deeper than economic metrics. In communities across the commonwealth, new manufacturing facilities are becoming hubs of innovation, fostering vital connections between industry and education. The Eos project exemplifies how Pennsylvania can maintain its energy leadership while embracing cleaner technologies. These investments create ripple effects throughout local economies, strengthening everything from small businesses to community institutions.

As these initiatives take root, they create robust industrial ecosystems that promise enduring economic benefits. Across Pennsylvania, federal clean energy investments are laying the groundwork that will benefit multiple generations of workers. This comprehensive approach ensures both immediate gains and lasting prosperity.

Pennsylvania’s emergence as a clean energy leader carries national significance. We’re creating a blueprint for industrial communities nationwide by marrying our manufacturing heritage with cutting-edge technology. This leadership position attracts additional investment and talent, generating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and innovation.

To sustain this momentum, we must continue supporting federal programs like the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These aren’t mere policy initiatives — they’re investments in Pennsylvania’s future as a clean energy manufacturing powerhouse and they are a significant driver of private investment in our region. Our success thus far demonstrates the transformative potential of these programs.

As Pennsylvania stands at this crucial economic crossroads, the evidence is clear: investments in clean energy and manufacturing are creating jobs, driving innovation, and building a stronger economic future. The Commonwealth’s successful transition toward clean energy manufacturing demonstrates that environmental stewardship and economic growth can work hand in hand, creating a model for industrial renaissance in the 21st century. By continuing to support and expand these investments, we can ensure that Pennsylvania remains at the forefront of America’s clean energy economy for generations to come.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/05/8546245_web1_ptr-McCormickTour007-040825.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 17:10:54.697621

BOSTON – The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) released its 2024 Massachusetts Clean Energy Industry Report today, highlighting that the clean energy industry is home to over 115,291 direct clean energy workers, having grown 100 percent since 2010. The industry contributed more than $15.9 billion to the Gross State Product (GSP) in 2023, a 74 percent increase since 2012. It also shows that 7,512 clean energy businesses exist across the state. Regarding direct jobs, the clean energy industry has a similar number as the College & University or Scientific Research industries, yet exceeds both industries' economic contribution in indirect and induced jobs and state GSP.

MassCEC’s 2024 report also found that 74 percent of clean energy jobs and businesses are located outside Route 128, and 58 percent of clean energy firms are small businesses (10 or fewer workers). A majority (53 percent) of clean energy workers are employed in energy efficiency, demand management, and clean heating and cooling jobs.

“Massachusetts is growing our global leadership in clean energy innovation, and we’re creating thousands of good-paying jobs and new businesses in the process,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Last year, I signed legislation to advance the development of homegrown clean energy and make Massachusetts the world’s climate innovation leader. As MassCEC’s report shows, our work is paying off—Massachusetts is setting the standard for the clean energy revolution.”

“Clean energy is a statewide success story, powered by a workforce of over 115,000 workers from Pittsfield to Provincetown,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “This report highlights how every region is playing a role in building our clean energy future, with small businesses, startups and global leaders choosing Massachusetts as their home. We’re committed to ensuring that all communities share in the benefits of this growing industry.”

“Massachusetts is proving that climate leadership fuels economic growth. From solar to geothermal, our clean energy transformation is creating thousands of good-paying jobs across a wide range of industries,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “This report showcases how electricians, HVAC specialists, and manufacturing workers are all playing an important role in making our state more energy independent. The strength of our workforce and the momentum we’ve built ensures that the clean energy economy is growing right here at home.”

“This year’s report reaffirms what we already know—the Massachusetts clean energy industry has grown into an economic force that is delivering real results for residents, workers, and communities. With a robust workforce, expanding industry sectors, and a strong commitment to climate resilience, we are charting a course for long-term success,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert. “At MassCEC, we’re focused on scaling these opportunities, creating equitable access to clean energy careers, and accelerating progress toward our net-zero goals.”

Since 2010, the Massachusetts clean energy industry has experienced 100 percent job growth, adding 57,610 new workers. This report also includes data from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s Workforce Needs Assessment which projected that Massachusetts needs about 28,000[TB1][EC2] more clean energy workers by the end of the decade.

To address this need, Governor Healey signed An Act promoting a clean energy grid, advancing equity, and protecting ratepayers and the Mass Leads Act in late 2024, two laws that will accelerate clean energy development and climate innovation while creating jobs and economic opportunities.

Released annually by MassCEC since 2010, the report includes data from December 2023. MassCEC’s methodology for the report, developed with BW Research Partnership, has been replicated by several other states and the U.S. Department of Energy. Read the full MassCEC Industry Report here[TB3][EC4] .

“It’s the environmental licensing that prevents us from having disasters,” Wallace Lopes, deputy director of ASCEMA, the association of federal environmental specialists, told Mongabay.
“That’s why we say it’s the end of environmental licensing,” she told Mongabay in a phone interview.
It creates a Special Environmental License for strategic projects, which could be approved in a single step within one year.
Lopes, from ASCEMA, said the real solution to speed up environmental licensing is to hire more staff for environmental bodies.","Brazil’s Congress is likely to approve what experts describe as the country’s most significant environmental setback since 1988 when the Constitution was enacted. Bill 2159/2021, which changes several rules of the environmental licensing framework, was approved by the Senate on May 21, six months before Brazil hosts the COP30 climate summit in the Amazonian city of Belém. The bill was heavily criticized by environmental organizations and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change — and celebrated by the powerful conservative forces of the Brazilian Congress. Experts argued that many of the bill’s provisions are unconstitutional.

Nevertheless, in the following days, it should easily pass its final vote in the Chamber of Deputies, controlled by the agribusiness, mining and energy caucus.

“Brazil, as president of the COP, cannot demonstrate to the whole world that it is going backwards in terms of caring for the environment by attacking its main environmental law,” representative Nilto Tatto, the environmental caucus coordinator in the Chamber of Deputies, told Mongabay. “We will long remember the day when the main damage prevention tool of the National Environmental Policy was completely weakened,” Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator at the civil society coalition Climate Observatory, stated on the organization’s website.

According to the current legislation, an environmental license is mandatory for all enterprises that use natural resources and may cause damage to the environment or local communities. The entrepreneur has to conduct studies to assess the project’s eventual impacts and propose mitigation measures. It is up to environmental experts from the federal, state or municipal levels to approve such studies and monitor the enterprises along the years, to ensure these rules are followed — a process often criticized for being too slow.

“It’s the environmental licensing that prevents us from having disasters,” Wallace Lopes, deputy director of ASCEMA, the association of federal environmental specialists, told Mongabay. “There is no other prevention tool. Inspection, punishment — all of this is for after the crime has already happened.”

The bill, however, exempts from these demands all small or medium-sized undertakings, which would undergo a much simpler process called License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC). Through this license, entrepreneurs would fill out an online form describing how their project isn’t breaking any environmental rules, and they would automatically be ready to move forward — a form of self-licensing. Around 80% of the projects that apply for licensing in Brazil today would fall under LAC, according to Ana Carolina Crisostomo, WWF-Brasil’s conservation expert. “That’s why we say it’s the end of environmental licensing,” she told Mongabay in a phone interview.

“The person presents the information, and there is no analysis of these documents,” Lopes said. “The name ‘license’ doesn’t even fit. If the person does everything themselves, why should the state have to authorize them or not?”

An example of a project that would fall under self-licensing is the Brumadinho dam, built by the mining company Vale in Minas Gerais state. In January 2019, the structure collapsed, releasing more than 12 million cubic meters (423.8 million cubic feet) of mine tailings and killing more than 270 people. The Paraopeba River, flooded with all the toxic mud, remains contaminated six years after the disaster.

“With the full license in force, we have already seen an accident like this because there was no inspection, no compliance,” Crisostomo said. “Now imagine if this dam is approved through a simplified process. Half of the preventive and remedial actions would not have been planned and could not have been implemented.”

The voting happened the same week the Brazilian environmental agency, IBAMA, bowed to political pressures, including from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and approved a key step that could allow offshore oil drilling that threatens the mouth of the Amazon River. The state oil company Petrobras is now one step away from getting the license to explore an area with a high risk of oil spills, according to environmental agents. In the case of an accident, oil could reach eight countries, the Amazon’s great coral reef and the world’s largest mangrove belt.

One of the legal devices of the new law would precisely benefit projects deemed “strategic” by the federal administration, such as the exploration of the Amazon coast; the national oil agency will offer another 47 blocks on the same area in a public bid on June 17. The decision about what is or isn’t strategic would be up to a political council.

The measure was proposed at the last minute by the Senate’s president, Davi Alcolumbre, a staunch defender of Petrobras’ controversial project in its home state, Amapá. It creates a Special Environmental License for strategic projects, which could be approved in a single step within one year.

“It’s quite clear that this amendment was custom-made because of the controversy surrounding the well in the Amazon River Mouth Basin,” said ASCEMA’s Lopes. He added that many kinds of projects can be considered strategic, including hydroelectric plants, large roads and mining complexes.

Lula has a long-held appreciation for large infrastructure projects. The most notorious example is the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant, initiated in Lula’s second term (2007-10) and concluded by his political ally Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), which altered the course of the Xingu River, displaced tens of thousands of people and caused the deaths of more than 85,000 fish.

“There is a very old vision of development within the federal government, and the president expresses this a lot,” Crisostomo said.

The special license may also apply to projects like Ferrogrão, a railway connecting Brazil’s granary states to the Tapajós River, which could lead to the deforestation of 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles) according to the Climate Policy Initiative.

The same applies to the paving of BR-319, a road connecting the capitals of Rondônia and Amazonas states, Porto Velho and Manaus. The project could also benefit from another innovation from the bill, which facilitates the licensing of improvement works to existing projects.

“According to the bill, the paving of this road would not require a license,” Lopes said. “But the environmental impact is completely different when you pave such a road.”

The Brazilian government opened the road in the 1970s, but there is an unpaved 400-km (250-mi) stretch that becomes undrivable for most of the year. Studies show that putting asphalt on his section would result in a fourfold increase in deforestation rates around it, which lies in one of the Amazon’s most preserved areas. Forty conservation areas and 50 Indigenous territories would be affected, including isolated Indigenous groups.

“If the law created a self-license for small and medium-sized businesses and a special license for large businesses, then there’s nothing left,” Lopes said.

Ignoring traditional communities

The bill also exempts entrepreneurs from considering their projects’ impact on hundreds of Indigenous and Quilombola communities — inhabited by descendants of enslaved Black people — that haven’t been fully titled by the federal administration.

According to Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), a Brazilian NGO fighting for traditional people, 259 Indigenous lands would be excluded from the impact studies, 32.6% of all territories. When it comes to Quilombola communities, 1,553 of them would be ignored (80%). “They will be considered nonexistent for the purposes of environmental licensing, impact assessment and the requirement for conditions to prevent, mitigate or compensate for socioenvironmental impacts,” ISA stated in a technical note. According to ISA, Brazil’s conservation units would also be ignored in the licensing process unless the venture’s facilities are located directly inside them.

The bill also exempts agriculture and cattle ranching from environmental licensing. Ranchers will still need authorization to deforest but won’t have to present studies showing how much water they will collect from the streams, where they will dispose of their waste or how much wood they will take from that area. “We have strong indications that deforestation will increase a lot,” Crisostomo said.

In a public statement, Brazil’s environmental ministry said the bill “represents a significant dismantling of the existing rules on the subject and poses a risk to the country’s environmental and social security,” besides being “silent on the climate crisis.” On May 27, after being harassed by congressmen in a Senate commission, Marina Silva, the Environment and Climate Change minister, said that “the environmental licensing is an achievement of Brazilian society” and “only the Brazilian people can prevent this dismantling that is being proposed.”

The Climate Observatory stated in a public letter that “the approval of this bill will seriously compromise the country’s environmental credibility” and “could prevent Brazil from meeting its emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.”

Brazil’s leading federal health research center, Fiocruz, also published a technical note stating the bill “relativizes the responsibility of entrepreneurs and reduces the capacity of the State to ensure the protection of life, collective health and ecosystems.”

Supporters of the bill said it will bring legal security and reduce bureaucracy for Brazilian entrepreneurs. During debates, many senators endorsed the proposal, saying it won’t hurt nature since it’s not changing environmental protection laws, only speeding up licenses, despite warnings from experts. “There are things that can be licensed much more quickly; we don’t have the people to analyze everything that is being proposed in a notarial manner,” Senator Tereza Cristina, the project’s rapporteur and a leader of the agribusiness caucus, told CNN Brazil. Cristina acted as the agriculture minister of former President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), whose far-right policies looked to reduce environmental protections.

However, experts say the law may increase legal uncertainty since it will be up to each state or municipality to determine a project’s impacts and the kind of licensing it must follow. “How will we have legal certainty if we have a proliferation of rules instead of standardization? It will generate a lot of judicialization,” WWF’s Crisostomo said.

Lopes, from ASCEMA, said the real solution to speed up environmental licensing is to hire more staff for environmental bodies. “The reality is that there are no people to do the work. And that’s what the bill doesn’t tackle.”

Representative Tatto and NGOs admit the chances of reverting the bill in the Deputy’s Chamber are low. President Lula may veto some of the articles if the proposal is approved, but Congress will likely overturn them. The last resource would be to contest the law in the Supreme Court. “We’ll go as far as judicializing it because it’s a flagrant affront to the Constitution itself,” Tatto said.

Eagle County, the Supreme Court undermined the principle that the government must consider predictable environmental harms before approving big projects.

In this case, Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity represented environmental and public health groups in defending this common-sense approach, which protects both people and the environment from ill-conceived proposals.

Why it matters: This case is part of a broad attack by polluting industries and their political allies seeking to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a federal law that gives the public a voice in environmental decision-making and helps agencies account for the impact of proposed projects.

Now that these industries have gotten their way, more pipelines, chemical facilities, and other destructive infrastructure could get approved without the federal agencies involved having to consider their potentially harmful environmental effects. The Court’s decision, coupled with other recent federal actions to weaken the regulations implementing NEPA, creates more chaos and confusion and will likely result in more litigation.

The Facts of the Case

Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County is about an 88-mile proposed rail project in Utah that would transport waxy crude oil from the Uinta Basin to existing rail networks in Colorado, ultimately allowing the oil to end up in the ports and refineries in the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. The rail line’s backers believe it could increase oil production in the region up to five-fold.

A coalition of environmental groups and Eagle County, Colorado, challenged the rail project’s approval in court. They argued that it violated NEPA’s requirement that the federal agency responsible for approving the project must disclose and analyze all reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.

In 2023, a federal court threw out the project’s approval. The court found that the federal agency, the Surface Transportation Board, failed to explain why it did not address harms from increased drilling in the Basin and from increased crude oil refining on the Gulf Coast. The agency also failed to weigh the impact of spills and accidents involving oil trains, including contaminating the Colorado River.

A coalition of county governments that wanted the railroad built took the decision to the Supreme Court. The counties argued against settled law that requires agencies to consider predictable environmental harms before deciding whether to permit a project.

What’s at Stake

Industry and its allies wanted the Court to prevent our government from looking before it leaps. Congress wrote NEPA to make sure that government agencies consider the environmental consequences of their decisions before acting. In this case, polluting industries and their allies successfully convinced the Court to put blinders on those agencies and keep the public in the dark.

The proposed rail line won’t just affect the communities and habitats that it would run through. Its construction means that trains full of crude oil will travel precariously close to the Colorado River. Its ultimate destination was the refineries along the Gulf, an area already overburdened by the negative impacts of fossil fuel production whose residents would face more exposure to toxic pollution. Burning that oil will also worsen climate change and increase extreme weather events across the country.

Earthjustice got involved in this fight because agencies need to make transparent, well-informed decisions that incorporate concerns from affected communities — as the law requires them to do. NEPA is the way for federal agencies to consider a project’s harm and alternatives that could lessen that harm. It’s a valuable tool for engaging communities, promoting transparency, and ensuring the government is making well-informed decisions that benefit the public good.

The U.S. automotive sector risks being left behind as the rest of the world undergoes a revolutionary transformation to electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles.
Even though U.S. companies currently perform strongly in autonomous driving, dismissing electric and connected vehicles will lead to long-term challenges for U.S. companies, which will need to excel in all three technologies in the long term.
The United States should evaluate whether it wants to be associated with old technology rather than the forefront of innovation, as it had traditionally been.
U.S. companies and research institutions have remarkably advanced technology, but they will be unlikely to commercialize it if there is no market domestically.","As the Senate considers the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by the House, Congress faces critical choices that could reshape the future of U.S. industry—especially in relation to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and more generally, strategic decisions over how to best promote U.S. competitiveness in advanced technologies.

For the automotive sector, the stakes are high: The 30D consumer tax credits and the 45X advanced manufacturing production credits are at risk of being canceled or significantly curtailed. This comes at a time when the Trump administration is also seeking to reduce fuel-economy standards, and Congress has overturned a waiver that allows California to set its own standards for emissions, effectively striking down the state’s ban on the sale of non-electric vehicles (EVs) past 2035. Charging infrastructure also remains woefully inadequate, but the current administration has paused new funding to expand it. The combined effect would be a 180-degree policy change for an industry that requires years of planning, and the removal of the consumer tax credits would largely nullify incentives to localize manufacturing and diversify supply chains. Large investments from industry were planned in batteries, automotive manufacturing, and critical mineral mining and refining, with the assumption of long-term policy stability, an assumption that is now in doubt. Perhaps even more concerning, the current approach to the automotive sector risks holding back U.S. innovation.

In the short term, a slowdown in the EV transition might benefit traditional U.S. automakers that are still struggling to make EVs profitably. However, it carries long-term effects for the United States. The U.S. automotive sector risks being left behind as the rest of the world undergoes a revolutionary transformation to electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles. If the federal government does not demonstrate more foresighted leadership, the United States may find that in less than a decade its companies have less say in setting global standards and have a shrinking global market because domestic regulation held back rather than push forward innovation, which would be vital to facilitate the testing and scaling of new-generation vehicles.

The latest data from the International Energy Agency underscores this point: In 2024, EVs accounted for 20 percent of global auto sales. The European Union, despite slow sales growth, was on average consistent with the trend, maintaining an average sales rate of 20 percent. China broke all records again, hitting almost 50 percent. But the United States lags, with EV sales currently at 10 percent and with low expectations for growth in the coming years. So, while the world as a whole is expected to reach a 25 percent EV sales rate in 2025 and 40 percent by 2030, the United States is expected to stay relatively stagnant at 11 percent in 2025. Some may think this is positive news because it will allow U.S. automakers to continue selling internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for longer. However, the technological lag in what is clearly going to be the direction of travel for the rest of the world should concern those who want the United States to stay technologically relevant and a leader in key technologies like the automotive sector.

Even with faster EV adoption, gas-powered cars are likely to continue selling well across much of the United States and globally over the next decade. Meanwhile, U.S. companies with valuable technologies, ranging from EV platforms and next-generation battery chemistries to alternative methods of extracting and processing critical minerals, would be far better positioned to achieve commercialization in both a growing domestic market and abroad. A comprehensive set of policies aimed at undermining EV adoption would have a chilling effect on investment and production in the United States and would inhibit U.S. companies from being able to scale their new technologies to compete internationally to access markets. According to a study by Princeton University, up to 72 percent of battery cell manufacturing capacity currently operating in the United States, as well as all planned capacity, would be at risk of closure if clean tax credits are repealed. Demand for EVs would not necessarily drop as significantly, but consumers would have far less incentive to buy vehicles with U.S.-made batteries. This will be made more challenging given that tariffs look poised to increase globally, and Chinese companies with formidable cost competitiveness and technology are expanding their international reach rapidly.

The U.S. debate over clean technology has become politicized in ways that obscure its core appeal in many markets where decisions are driven less by ideology than performance and price. EVs are still very expensive in the United States, averaging $55,000 in December 2024, or 12 percent more than the average ICE vehicle, but in China, EVs have the same cost as ICE vehicles, and the price is lower in some segments. Chinese EV exports have revolutionized the market in many emerging markets: EVs are now cheaper than ICE vehicles in Thailand, for example. But it’s not all about Chinese brands: For example, European regulation has incentivized domestic automakers to develop cheaper EV models, which are expected to hit the market in 2026. Meanwhile, low-cost EV offerings in the United States are expected to only expand marginally in the near future, which helps explain why they are sometimes viewed as an elite project.

Globally, consumers and governments have shown a strong interest in EVs because of energy security and efficiency concerns, but also because of the strong synergies between electric drivetrains and digital platforms. EVs are often equipped with more advanced software that makes driving easier and more pleasant. A recent global survey found that 92 percent of respondents who owned an EV would buy another EV if they had to replace their car tomorrow, and 97 percent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with their choice to own an EV. This all means that the technology’s global popularity will only increase in the coming years.

Connectivity, autonomous driving, and electric drivetrains are self-reinforcing technologies, as China’s exponential growth in the sector demonstrates. Even though U.S. companies currently perform strongly in autonomous driving, dismissing electric and connected vehicles will lead to long-term challenges for U.S. companies, which will need to excel in all three technologies in the long term.

In countries with high EV model availability—often thanks to lower tariffs—sales are rising rapidly even when other incentives are not present. However, when high tariffs are in place, usually to protect the domestic industry, the question gets more complex. Indeed, that is the situation the United States finds itself in today as well. The IRA, for all its flaws, recognized that if supply chains were to shift to the United States, they would likely face higher costs requiring initial government incentives to help achieve scale. Those incentives have been important in unlocking new investments in critical minerals, for example. This administration has recognized that deregulation can help further lower domestic costs and spur more investment. These two insights combined could be a powerful formula to empower future investment.

Compete or Isolate?

The United States needs to engage and compete in the future of the automotive industry or risk technological isolation. Despite potential synergies with other countries on national security issues concerning China, the automotive sector is one where it is hard to envision the United States swaying large portions of the world to reject Chinese technology. In fact, some European companies are seeking to acquire Chinese technology by buying stakes in Chinese startups, and many countries, ranging from Spain and Brazil to Indonesia, are competing to attract Chinese investment in the automotive and battery sectors. They’ve decided that strategic collaboration is more likely to strengthen their long-term competitiveness than isolation. Even Tesla, the U.S. EV manufacturer, relies on batteries developed with CATL, the Chinese battery manufacturer and technology company, for its Chinese-made vehicles, which are exported to Europe and other parts of the world.

If the United States doesn’t recommit to new-generation vehicle development, the result could be one where in just a few years U.S. consumers may go on vacation abroad and discover that their rental car or taxi is running on a technology that looks different and is in many ways more attractive than what is available at home. This problematic outcome would not be determined by an inherent lack of U.S. ingenuity, but rather because the U.S. market is simply not large or competitive enough to sustain the type of innovation that will be needed in the coming years. Chinese companies have been evolving at breakneck speed and rapidly expanding their global market share, leading governments and companies around the world to rethink their automotive strategy for the future. Undermining the companies that are trying to develop domestic value chains today will mean cutting off the most effective pathway to technological leadership tomorrow.

Thanks to tariffs and restrictions based on national security grounds, the United States is a well-protected market. But settling for no competition at all will lead to stagnation in the long term. The United States should evaluate whether it wants to be associated with old technology rather than the forefront of innovation, as it had traditionally been. U.S. companies and research institutions have remarkably advanced technology, but they will be unlikely to commercialize it if there is no market domestically. This is in practice what already happened with EVs and lithium-ion batteries, including lithium iron phosphate batteries, which were invented in the United States, but today Chinese firms excel in.

To move forward, Congress and the Trump administration should consider U.S. strategic interests and the direction of technological innovation globally before drawing conclusions based on short-term domestic trends alone. Policies to localize more of the supply chain and encourage the development of diversified supply chains for critical minerals and components like batteries should still be a U.S. priority. Killing the U.S. EV market and politicizing EVs will not strengthen the United States’ innovation ecosystem, although it will likely succeed in isolating it from the rest of the world.

That’s a long-debated issue that President Donald Trump has pushed back into the spotlight thanks to his effort to expand nuclear power in the United States.

Last week, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at easing the construction of new nuclear reactors, which the administration says will provide electricity needed to avoid shortages and power data centers used by artificial intelligence. In addition to taking steps to enable the construction of nuclear plants on public lands and expand U.S. uranium mining, the orders call for revisiting technical models the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) uses to set exposure limits for ionizing radiation, which can cause cancer and other health problems.

Some nuclear power proponents have argued NRC’s safety models have led to regulations that are too strict and costly to implement, creating a barrier to nuclear power. And in its 23 May announcement, the White House asserted, “Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. … Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion.”

The move to revisit the safety models promises to reignite an often fierce, decades-old scientific battle over the risks posed by radiation—and whether small doses might even have positive health effects.

Here’s some background:

Why is Trump targeting NRC?

The White House claims the agency, established in 1975 to oversee nuclear safety, has become an obstacle to approving new reactors. Since 1978, NRC has only approved five new reactors, and just two have been built: the Unit 3 and Unit 4 reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia. In contrast, 133 reactors were constructed in the U.S. over the previous 26 years. Currently, there are 94 operating reactors at 54 commercial power plants in 28 states. They generate about 19% of the nation’s electricity.

In a bid to promote new plant construction, Trump wants to downsize and reorganize NRC and require it to make final decisions on applications for new reactors within 18 months. The agency would get 12 months to act on requests to continue the operations of an existing reactor.

What safety models are at issue?

Radiation risks are mostly calculated from studies that examined cancer cases among 86,600 survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War II. Researchers found that the incidence of cancer in the survivors rose linearly—in a straight line—with the radiation dose. That suggests there’s no threshold below which exposure to radiation is harmless. Scientists call this the linear no-threshold (LNT) model of ionizing radiation. The LNT model is widely accepted in the scientific community and informs almost all regulation of the U.S. nuclear industry, including an NRC standard that calls for keeping radiation exposure “as low as reasonably achievable.”

There are critics of the LNT model, however. They point to a body of research on cells and animals, as well as epidemiology studies, that suggest radiation exposure below a certain threshold is safe and can even improve human health, an idea known as hormesis. In 2015, three members of a group called Scientists for Accurate Radiation Information cited the hormesis theory in petitions asking NRC to increase allowable doses for nuclear workers and the public. (One of the group’s missions is to prevent “radiation-phobia-related deaths,” according to its website.)

In 2021, NRC rejected the petitions, finding insufficient evidence to justify any changes. The agency noted the “actual level of risk associated with low doses of radiation remains uncertain,” but “there is not strong support for the hormesis concept in the scientific literature.” It also cited a 2005 report on low-dose radiation risks from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which is still considered one the most authoritative reviews of the issue. It concluded that the LNT model “continues to provide a sound regulatory basis for minimizing the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure.”

What happens next?

The Trump administration—which includes officials who have in the past called for less strict radiation standards and endorsed the hormesis concept—has ordered NRC to adopt new “science-based radiation limits” within 18 months. “In particular, the NRC shall reconsider reliance on the [LNT model] … and the ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ standard,” the executive order states.

The White House has asked NRC to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy and Defense in developing the new standards, which will likely be subject to a formal rulemaking that involves inviting comments from the public. Any final rules could then be subject to legal challenges, including claims that they violate a provision of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act that requires NRC to “minimize danger to life or property.”

What’s been the reaction to the executive orders?

The nuclear industry has welcomed Trump’s move. Maria Korsnick, CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group, thanked Trump during a White House event that featured him signing the orders. In a statement, Ur-Energy, a uranium mining company, applauded Trump’s “bold action … to return the U.S. to its leadership role in the nuclear sector.”

Some groups that see nuclear power as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels also offered praise. The call to reconsider the LNT model and other safety standards is a positive step toward reforming NRC’s “overly risk-averse culture, structure, and regulations,” wrote Adam Stein, director of the nuclear energy innovation program at the Breakthrough Institute, a nonprofit research organization.

Others are wary of the proposed regulatory changes. Trump’s order to revise exposure rules “flies in the face of globally held radiation safety standards,” says health researcher Stephen Bondy of the University of California Irvine, author of a 2023 review paper that found the science on hormesis is still unsettled. It “clearly places health hazards as of secondary importance relative to economic and business interests.”",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zvtbmij/abs/_20250523_on_trump_nuclear_power.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:50.955300

“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” it states.
Consumers Energy, meanwhile, is directed to pursue cost recovery through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
“It will ensure the power generation availability in the region does not dip below 2024 capacity levels,” the agency said on Friday.","The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued an emergency order to delay the closure of Consumer Energy’s 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, citing urgent reliability concerns for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid as the Midwest braces for peak summer electricity demand.

The rare order, issued May 23 by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, compels Consumers Energy and MISO to keep the three-unit subcritical coal-fired facility operational through Aug. 21, 2025—three months past its planned May 31, 2025, shutdown. Unlike most recent 202(c) emergency orders, which have responded to active grid emergencies like hurricanes or extreme weather and focused on short-term generation dispatch actions, Wright’s order preemptively delays a scheduled coal retirement amid warnings of tight reserve margins in the Midwest.

The order—the first of its kind in the mainland U.S. in recent history—comes a week after Wright invoked Section 202(c) to compel the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to dispatch more than 50 fossil-fueled generation units and accelerate transmission corridor vegetation clearing after two major blackouts underscored the island’s acute reliability crisis. As POWER reported in detail, those May 16 directives followed a full island-wide outage and warned that without immediate intervention, Puerto Rico could face up to 135 days of forced load shedding this summer.

According to the order, the emergency action follows warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment concluded that MISO faces elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls, particularly during August and periods of high demand or low resource output.

MISO, in a statement on May 8, acknowledged the elevated risk “due to the potential for extreme weather events and the continued decline in accredited capacity.” However, it anticipates adequate resources to serve summer demand. Peak demand could reach nearly 123 GW, with about 138 GW of regularly available generation expected across the MISO footprint, it said.

Consumers Energy earlier this month also said it is “prepared to deliver safe, reliable and affordable power to customers across the region throughout the summer.” The utility emphasized that its “integrated energy strategy—featuring a balanced mix of generation sources, preparation and customer programs—ensures that homes and businesses stay powered during peak demand periods.” It added: “Consumers Energy’s forward-looking supply plan features a robust mix of flexible generation resources that continue to evolve through strategic investments, like the acquisition of the Covert facility and recent expansion of the Zeeland Generating Station. We will also continue the operation of the Jackson Generating Station and the Karn 3 and 4 combined cycle units.”

Mandatory Operation and Dispatch Instructions

However, the DOE in its order noted that Michigan has retired about 2,700 MW of coal-fired generation, while its nuclear generation has declined with the decommissioning of Big Rock Point in 1997 and Palisades in 2022. While Palisades is scheduled to restart later in 2025, it will not be available for the summer peak. Campbell’s “retirement would further decrease available dispatchable generation within MISO’s service territory, removing additional such generation along with the other 1,575 MW of natural gas and coal-fired generation that has retired since the summer of 2024,” the order said.

“MISO’s Planning Resource Auction Results for Planning Year 2025-26, released in April 2025, note that for the northern and central zones, which includes Michigan, ‘new capacity additions were insufficient to offset the negative impacts of decreased accreditation, suspensions/retirements and external resources,’” the order notes. “While the results ‘demonstrated sufficient capacity,’ the summer months reflected the ‘highest risk and a tighter supply-demand balance,’ and the results ‘reinforce the need to increase capacity.’”

The order compels both MISO and Consumers Energy to keep the Campbell plant operational and available for dispatch throughout the emergency period. “MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” it states.

‘Economic Dispatch’

To limit cost impacts, the DOE further instructs MISO to “take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” That generally means that while the plant will not be expected to run continuously, it must be ready to generate power whenever needed. Economic dispatch allows grid operators to prioritize the use of the plant only when it is more cost-effective than alternatives, helping reduce financial strain on consumers.

While authorizing emergency use, the order also acknowledges potential conflicts with environmental rules. “Operation is limited to the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” it says, and the plant must comply with environmental laws “to the maximum extent practicable while operating consistent with the emergency conditions.”

Under the order’s timeframe, MISO will be expected to report daily to the DOE on the plant’s operational status and compliance and submit a full update by June 15 outlining all steps taken to ensure availability, environmental mitigation, and any operational issues. Consumers Energy, meanwhile, is directed to pursue cost recovery through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The DOE explicitly noted that “Consumers Energy is directed to seek necessary tariff revisions or waivers at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for cost recovery, as allowed under the Federal Power Act.”

According to the DOE, the move is in line with President Trump’s January 2025 declaration of a national energy emergency. “It will ensure the power generation availability in the region does not dip below 2024 capacity levels,” the agency said on Friday.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Secretary Wright said. “This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies to threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jh-campbell-complex-waterway-descriptor3.png,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:56.662296

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies.","Emmanuel Martin-Lauzer is director of business development and public affairs at Nexans.

The jury is still out on whether the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped contain or reduce inflation. Nevertheless, certain provisions have delivered tangible benefits that deserve closer examination before any potential repeal. While some provisions may not have broad appeal, one success of the IRA has been its impact on strengthening U.S. energy production. The bill speaks more to renewable energy innovation and increase in energy independence to support U.S. economic growth than to direct economic impact. Repealing it wholesale risks far more than we might anticipate.

At its core, the IRA tax credits for energy generation are driving significant investment in innovative energy production. Because renewable energy makes up around 21.4% of the energy mix, these incentives have been passed down the chain to the benefits of the ratepayer, while simultaneously sustaining the creation of entire industries. These investments have sparked construction and manufacturing jobs across both red and blue states, proving that clean energy isn’t just an environmental initiative.

These tax credits have also bolstered America’s energy independence. Renewables like solar, onshore wind and offshore wind are integral to our domestic energy supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources, and making our own infrastructure more resilient. They’ve also driven initiatives to improve long-term cost competitiveness, incentivizing developers to innovate to reduce costs.

Our current grid infrastructure and energy generation systems are nearing obsolescence and over the next decade the demand on these systems is expected to skyrocket. Data centers alone are expected to double their electricity demand, and by 2035, over 71 million electric vehicles will require around 400 kWh to charge per month. Urbanization trends are compounding this demand as more people move to cities.

Without the IRA tax credits, we risk slowing down our ability to develop more power generation, growing the risk of rolling blackouts and higher energy costs for the average ratepayer, all while increasing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Today’s decisions don’t impact today’s costs, they impact tomorrow’s ability to grow our economy.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the Internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Renewable energy is no exception.

Since the IRA has been enacted, the renewable energy industry has created thousands of jobs and established numerous domestic manufacturing plants on U.S. soil spurred by these domestic supply tax credit incentives. Manufacturing isn’t the only business reaping these benefits either. These credits have helped support better-paying jobs in specialized professions such as those in the maritime industry for offshore wind or wind technician positions.

Energy diversity isn’t just good economics — it’s a good security policy. With a diverse mix of energy sources (nuclear, fuel based, hydro, renewable), we reduce the risk of monopolies that drive up costs, as seen with Standard Oil’s monopoly in the early 20th century. Competition forces developers to lower costs, driving the cost of energy downwards. Furthermore, the energy has to come from somewhere and the question is not about the current costs of renewable energy but the future cost of energy in general to consumers without renewables in the energy mix of the future. There is nothing more damaging than energy you need but can’t find.

From a national security perspective, energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. If one source is cut off, others can fill the gap, ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing our reliance on adversarial nations for critical resources. Not only are we safer from attack, but we are also responsible for our own generation. This further helps reduce costs, but also prevents us from being beholden to other countries, especially our adversaries, for energy and tangential resources such as rare minerals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Hv8PCyQkZi0Q_aXEa5Bbam_cDvRz6BlNQ8WwJzkdND8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEyMTQ2Mzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:21.939452

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford on Thursday sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said at a policy conference in the state.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The tax-reform bill passed by the House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology. Ford’s factory, now under construction, would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant in 2023, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

Trump Administration Trade and Tariff Policies

Foley & Lardner provided an overview for multinational companies regarding the most common False Claims Act risks that may arise from improper management of import operations.

A May 28 ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade suspended a significant portion of the Trump administration’s tariffs, after the panel determined the executive branch had wrongfully invoked an emergency law to justify the levies. The Trump administration has requested a stay and appealed the ruling.

The Department of Commerce on May 20 issued the “procedures for submission of documentation related to automobile tariffs,” for automobile importers to comply with the process of identifying the amount of U.S. content in each model imported into the United States. The agency stated there were roughly 200 repeat importers of subject automobiles in 2024. The notice indicated there are 13 OEMs with automobile operations in Canada and Mexico, with production spanning 54 vehicle model lines.

The Commerce Department on May 20 announced preliminary determinations that active anode material produced in China is unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government, which could lead to anti-subsidy duties on imports. The agency expects to issue final determinations in countervailing duty (CVD) investigations later this year. Active anode material is a key component in lithium-ion batteries.

China began issuing a limited number of export licenses for certain rare earth magnets, following weeks of uncertainty after the nation imposed trade restrictions over certain rare earth minerals and magnets in early April. The magnets are essential for a range of auto components.

Section 232 tariffs will not help the United States diversify its sources of critical minerals and reduce its reliance on China, according to a recent letter from the National Association of Manufacturers to the Commerce Department. The NAM suggested policymakers should instead pursue permitting reforms, secure favorable trade and investment terms with international allies, and enact strategic incentives to enhance domestic production. China mines roughly 70% of the world’s rare earths, and the nation has a 90% share for the processing of rare earths mined worldwide.

President Trump on May 25 stated the U.S. will delay implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union from June 1 until July 9, 2025.

Automotive Key Developments

In a May 29 Society of Automotive Analysts Coffee Break webinar, Ann Marie Uetz of Foley & Lardner and Steven Wybo of Riveron provided an overview of the mounting risk of EV programs and the resulting key takeaways for automotive suppliers.

Crain’s Detroit provided an update regarding the status of several ongoing legal disputes between Stellantis and certain suppliers.

MEMA survey data found three-quarters of automotive suppliers expect worse financial performances in 2025 than previously anticipated. In addition, more than half of the trade group’s members are concerned about sub-tier supplier financial distress resulting from higher tariff-related costs, as well as the potential for North American production volumes to fall as low as 13.9 million to 14.3 million this year.

U.S. new light-vehicles sales are projected to reach a SAAR of 15.6 million units in May, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData. The analysis estimates “approximately 149,000 extra vehicles were sold” in March and April ahead of the expectation for higher prices due to tariffs, and the “re-timed sales will present a headwind to the industry sales pace for the balance of this year.”

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration submitted its interpretive rule, “Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program,” to the White House for review. The Environmental Protection Agency is pursuing parallel vehicle emissions rules.

The U.S. Senate on May 22 approved three House-passed Congressional Review Act resolutions to revoke EPA-granted waivers that allowed California to impose vehicle emissions standards that were stricter than federal regulations.

The “big, beautiful” tax and budget bill passed by the U.S. House on May 22 would terminate several tax credits for EVs after December 31, 2025, including commercial EVs under Section 45W, consumer credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs under Section 30D and up to $4,000 in consumer credits for used EVs under Section 25E, as well as a credit for charging infrastructure under Section 30C. The bill also included a measure to establish annual registration fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles to supplement the Highway Trust Fund.

Companies that collect and store personal data will soon have to comply with a Department of Justice rule that restricts sharing bulk sensitive personal data with persons from China, Russia, Iran, and other countries identified as foreign adversaries. The Data Security Program implemented by the National Security Division (NSD) under Executive Order 14117 took effect April 8, 2025. However, the DOJ will not prioritize enforcement actions between April 8 and July 8, 2025 if a company is “engaging in good faith efforts” towards compliance.

While President Trump expressed approval for a “planned partnership” between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, questions remain about the timeline for the proposed $14 billion merger first announced in December 2023. The deal may involve a so-called “golden share,” allowing the U.S. federal government to weigh in on certain company decisions, according to unconfirmed reports.

The University of Michigan predicted U.S. vehicle prices could rise 13.2% on average, or by $6,200 per vehicle, due to tariffs and retaliatory trade policies.

OEMs/Suppliers

Plante Moran’s annual North American Automotive OEM – Supplier Working Relations Index® (WRI®) Study found supplier relationships improved with Toyota, Honda and GM, and declined with Nissan, Ford and Stellantis compared to last year’s study. Toyota gained 18 points for its highest WRI score since 2007, while Stellantis dropped 11 points and remains in last place.

Stellantis named Antonio Filosa as CEO, effective June 23. Filosa currently serves as chief operating officer for the Americas and chief quality officer.

GM will invest $888 million to produce next-generation V-8 engines at its Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, NY, representing the largest single investment the automaker has ever made in an engine plant. The automaker canceled a $300 million investment to retool the plant to manufacture EV drive units.

“Future nominees to FERC will likely be evaluated not just on qualifications but on their perceived loyalty to the administration,” he said.
“I find it hard to believe that over the next few years, we’ll end up in a place where the president can fire independent commissioners at will without congressional intervention,” he said.
“Further, FERC has routinely consisted of subject matter experts who improve in their duties based on the experience they gain in their respective positions.

“Future nominees to FERC will likely be evaluated not just on qualifications but on their perceived loyalty to the administration,” he said. “That adds a layer of risk where commissioners may do their job with fear or favor — something entirely at odds with Congress’ intent in creating independent commissions…”

If the court does strike down or weaken the independence of certain agencies, Chandler doesn’t expect Congress to sit idly by as the institutions it made get overhauled.

“I find it hard to believe that over the next few years, we’ll end up in a place where the president can fire independent commissioners at will without congressional intervention,” he said. “Even if it’s only through the confirmation process, I expect lawmakers will push back to preserve agency independence…”

“FERC’s core job, today and historically, is ratemaking, which is legislative in nature,” Chandler said. “Further, FERC has routinely consisted of subject matter experts who improve in their duties based on the experience they gain in their respective positions. I can’t think of an agency that more encapsulates the tenets of Humphrey’s Executor…”

But the implications go beyond internal decision-making and into the public arena, Chandler with R Street said.

“Any executive in the country would be crazy to want to change the paradigm from an independent agency setting rates to giving even the appearance that they dictate the agency’s actions,” Chandler said. “One of the primary jobs of FERC is to set wholesale rates, and if commissioners can be fired at will, then every time a rate hike happens, people will blame the president.”

Chandler emphasized that this perception — even if not backed by reality — could be politically damaging and destabilize trust in regulatory outcomes.

“Appearance is all that matters,” he said. “That’s a terrible scenario for individual consumers and for the American economy.”",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yoest-facebook-share-default.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:19.664927

In its latest announcement, the EPA signaled a move toward greater flexibility for public water systems in meeting compliance requirements, emphasizing its dual goals of protecting public health and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable, particularly for smaller water systems.
It remains crucial for water systems to continue assessing their water sources for PFAS and to plan for necessary treatment and compliance measures, keeping the new timelines in mind.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced it will maintain the current National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for the two most common per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PFOA and PFOS. It will also rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for several other PFAS, including PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), a Hazard Index mixture involving those three compounds and PFBS.

These changes include several plans that could make it easier for public water systems to comply with federal drinking water standards.

The EPA's latest announcement follows the establishment of final National Primary Drinking Water Regulations on April 10, 2024. The standards set legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for these PFAS. These regulations establish nationwide limits for these persistent ""forever chemicals"" in public drinking water. They apply to ""public water systems,"" defined as any publicly or privately owned system providing water for human consumption that has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days per year.

The EPA initially gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with these MCLs, which many criticized as infeasible. In its latest announcement, the EPA signaled a move toward greater flexibility for public water systems in meeting compliance requirements, emphasizing its dual goals of protecting public health and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable, particularly for smaller water systems.

The latest move also follows the EPA’s newly released guidance to help states address PFAS discharges into water sources, which can result in the contamination of drinking water.

The EPA outlined several new initiatives aimed at supporting water systems:

Extended compliance deadlines: The EPA plans to initiate a rulemaking process to extend the compliance deadline for the PFOA and PFOS MCLs to 2031.

Federal exemption framework: The EPA intends to establish a federal exemption framework, offering a structured approach for systems needing more time or facing unique challenges.

PFAS OUT Initiative: A new program, the PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT), will engage utilities, technical assistance providers, and local, state, tribal, and territorial leaders to develop practical and effective solutions, with a particular focus on rural and small communities.

The EPA's decision to maintain PFOA and PFOS standards while also providing extended compliance timelines and new support mechanisms offers a degree of certainty combined with necessary flexibility for public water systems.

Water systems and other stakeholders should stay informed about the upcoming rulemaking process for the extended compliance deadlines and the development of the federal exemption framework. They should also take advantage of the resources and engagement opportunities that will be available through the PFAS OUTreach Initiative.

The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.
Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot.
Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean.","Li-Cycle once seemed like a leader among the startups trying to recycle electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. Now it’s mired in bankruptcy proceedings.

The company’s board replaced the CEO and CFO in a decision announced May 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was looking for buyers. A potential deal with mining giant and lead creditor Glencore evidently had not come to fruition: Two weeks later, a Canadian bankruptcy court appointed Alvarez & Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has loaned $10.5 million to keep things going during the proceedings. Glencore also entered a ​“stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the $275 million it previously invested in Li-Cycle.

“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez & Marsal pitch in a flyer for the sale.

That ​“compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general. A few years ago, the sector was flush with venture capital and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs while minimizing mining. The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.

Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.

Li-Cycle successfully built five ​“spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.

The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June.

The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office finalized a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle never drew on that federal money because it couldn’t secure additional private funding to hold in reserve, as stipulated in the loan terms.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

The adjacent U.S. EV sector has seen slower growth than expected, which has in turn reduced the urgency of building out a North American battery supply chain. Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean. And battery makers have increasingly turned to lithium iron phosphate, a cheaper alternative to nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries, further reducing the value of recycling these batteries.

New supply-chain ‘passports’ pave the way for more recycling of EV batteries

In the past year, a fire destroyed the largest battery shredding plant in the U.S., Interco’s Critical Mineral Recovery site in Missouri. Reno, Nevada–based Aqua Metals ran low on funds and laid off staff while it searched for financing to build a commercial-scale recycling line. Ascend Elements delayed construction of its flagship recycling plant in Kentucky, citing a customer’s decision to postpone buying the recycled materials. In March, Ascend canceled plans to make cathode active materials in Kentucky to focus on precursor materials and lithium carbonate.

Redwood Materials is the rare bright spot. The venture by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel raised a couple billion dollars and has been building out a major compound in the desert outside Reno, not far from Tesla’s factory there. In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.

The industry’s challenges come as the Trump administration says it aims to expand U.S. mineral supplies. Paradoxically, the administration has taken steps to undermine the fledgling U.S. EV and battery industries, which are the big drivers of demand growth for rare earth metals. The budget bill passed by the House last week would strip tax incentives for EV purchases and battery installations, weakening demand for the domestic supply chain that recyclers like Li-Cycle hoped to serve — and making the tough road for recycling firms even tougher.",https://www.corporateknights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Li-Cycle2.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:24.192763

SALT LAKE CITY — Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the University of Utah has been selected to receive $2 million in Brownfields Grants to assess, cleanup and revitalize local lands.

“The Brownfields program is about turning opportunity into action, and the University of Utah has done exactly that,” said Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western. “This funding is a smart use of resources that reflects our commitment to both economic growth and environmental responsibility.”

Previous environmental site assessments conducted by the University of Utah at the SLC Station Center have identified harmful contamination on the property such as arsenic and volatile organic compounds. The University plans on remediating the soil and groundwater contamination for future commercial reuse in alignment with Salt Lake City’s Community Revitalization Agency’s Rio Grande Plan.

These grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants nationally announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This funding put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday approved NuScale Power’s design for 77 megawatt reactors, clearing a hurdle for the company as it seeks to be the first company to build a U.S. small modular reactor.

NuScale sought approval for the 77 MW design to improve economics and performance of its planned small modular reactors (SMRs), after having originally received NRC approval in 2020 for a 50 MW reactor design.

SMRs are designed to be built in factories with relatively easily replicated parts instead of onsite like conventional nuclear power plants. Backers say the reactors will be safer to operate, their uranium cycles will be more resistant to access from militants seeking to obtain fissile materials, and their modular aspect will reduce costs for multiple plants.

SMR critics say they will be more expensive to operate than conventional reactors, which have larger reactors, and they will continue to produce radioactive waste for which the U.S. has no permanent repository.

NuScale is the only U.S. company with an approved design, but reaching the point of building a plant has been elusive. In 2023 NuScale axed its first project with a Utah municipal power group, despite a U.S. government promise of $1.35 billion in funding over 10 years for the plant, known as the Carbon Free Power Project. As costs rose, several towns had pulled out of the project.

John Hopkins, NuScale’s president and chief executive, said Thursday’s approval, which came two months earlier than had been expected, allows the company to construct and operate a plant.

“We now have an American technology that is near-term deployable,” Hopkins said. As many as 12 of the 77 MW reactors can be put together in a plant, he said, which would be about the size of a typical conventional reactor.

Hopkins said the company could have an SMR in operation by the end of the decade if a customer moves quickly. “It’s really in the customer’s hands.”

NuScale shares were down 3.9% at $33.96 in afternoon trade.

Interest in nuclear energy has spiked as U.S. power demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in so-called hyper-scalers building data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

Last week President Donald Trump signed four executive orders aiming to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including reducing staffing levels in some offices. The orders also directed the Energy and Defense departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.

The orders did not direct any new public funding but could open the way for financing from the Loan Programs Office.

Hopkins said NuScale is in talks to build SMRs with five “tier one hyper-scalers that we have non-disclosure agreements with.” He did not identify them.

(WZMQ) – The state of Michigan has launched a new partnership with DTE Energy and Consumers Energy aimed at boosting in-state manufacturing and accelerating clean energy job growth.

Announced Wednesday at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference, the utilities have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually to purchase equipment, technology, and services from Michigan-based suppliers, $2 billion from DTE, and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy. Jonathan Smith, Senior Chief Deputy Director with the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO), said this will create a massive opportunity for michigan manufacturers to make more of the things utilities are going to need to buy to build out a new and more reliable energy grid over the next decade.

Though the partnership is between the two largest utilities in the lower peninsula, the plan is to eventually expand to include smaller utilities.

“We’re starting with the state’s two largest investor-owned utilities because they have so much scale. It allows us to aggregate this demand and create real market opportunities for manufacturers.” Smith said. “Our next step from here is to go out to municipal energy utilities around the state, bring them into this partnership as well.”

He emphasized that the search for manufacturers will also target businesses across the state, looking for new businesses that arent in the energy supply chain yet to give them a chance to move into the market and grow their businesses.

“Even if you’re not in one of these service areas, say you’re a manufacturer or a business, we are going to look at reaching out to businesses across the state who have the right capabilities to make some of this equipment, to help them move into these supply chains,” Smith said. “We think Michigan is already a leading state for the energy industry, and we can really grow that through this partnership with our utilities.”

The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s Community & Worker Economic Transition Office is coordinating the effort, which includes the launch of the MI Hub for Manufacturers. The Hub will offer digital tools, expert advice, capital access, and funding opportunities to make sure small and mid-sized manufacturers have the tools they need to grow their business.

“We have these amazing organizations all over the state. There’s the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, there’s Automation Alley, there are small business development centers. These are resources that every business in the state has access to, but they can be hard to find.” Smith said. “This web resource is going to allow you to quickly find all of the different services and programs that can help you grow your business. And it will also help you if you need multiple services from multiple providers, you’ll be able to get a plan that’s right for you in one place that might involve working with multiple different entities. It’s going to make it easier for business owners to get support, to get help, and to learn about tools they might not know exist.”

DTE and Consumers Energy will work with the state to find and support Michigan-based suppliers that are manufacturing the needed solar components, long-duration battery storage systems, transformers, and other new energy technologies. Smith said the initiative is also aimed at helping utilities meet reliability and resiliency goals while controlling costs for ratepayers.

The MI Hub for Manufacturers is expected to help businesses retool facilities and retain employees as new work becomes available through utility contracts. Partners designing the platform say it demonstrates how government, philanthropy, and industry can work together to deliver practical value to small and mid-sized businesses.",https://wzmq19.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2023-10-17-225800.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:36.087920

Of these provisions, the ones that were likely to cost the most in the long run were the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit.

The House bill does terminate several IRA energy credits, including some related to cars and homes at the end of this year.
The home related credits that will be terminated are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, Residential Clean Energy Credit, and the Energy Efficient Home Credit.","Many of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit reforms that exist in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act comes through early phaseouts of these credits instead of immediate repeal.

A 2025 study by the Cato Institute found that the IRA energy subsidies could cost up to $4.7 trillion by 2050. Of these provisions, the ones that were likely to cost the most in the long run were the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit. These credits were initially not set to expire until the later of a certain emissions threshold or 2032. As the threshold will not be reached for quite some time, if ever, this is essentially an uncapped subsidy. Under the House version of the reconciliation bill, these credits will begin phasing down in 2029 and phase out by 2032. In 2029, they will be 80 percent of their current level, then 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and 0 percent after December 31, 2032.

The bill also phases out the 45X Manufacturing Credit by December 31, 2031, and restricts it from applying to foreign entities two years after the bill’s enactment.

Phasing out tax credits simply kicks the can down the road, allowing dependency on the credits to grow and market distortions to continue. There is also a risk that these credits will be extended later, as we point out in a recent CEI report:

Further, half-measures like phasing out the subsidies are unacceptable in part because the subsidies may never actually get repealed. They will just stick around until they can be extended. Such an approach also continues and increases the dependency on the subsidies, making it harder to get rid of them due to special interests becoming even more invested in defending them.

A recent piece from the Institute for Energy Research makes a similar argument:

Time and again, subsidy mechanisms like tax credits and production mandates are introduced with specific expiration dates or phase-down schedules, framed as temporary boosts for nascent technologies or short-term solutions to specific problems. Yet, history shows these policies are not temporary, with Congress granting “temporary” extensions year after year after year.

Leaving these credits in place for several more years runs the risk of them never truly going away. Phasing out these credits isn’t undoing the Green New Deal. It may or may not be a small step forward, but regardless, it isn’t nearly what is needed.

The House bill does terminate several IRA energy credits, including some related to cars and homes at the end of this year. The car credits provisions that will be terminated are the: Clean Vehicle Credit, Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit, Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit.

The home related credits that will be terminated are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, Residential Clean Energy Credit, and the Energy Efficient Home Credit.

The House took some first steps in addressing these tax credits, but much more still needs to be done. If Republicans genuinely want to kill off the Green New Deal and advance sound energy policy, the Senate should go much further than the House and terminate these credits as opposed to merely phasing them out.

Ultimately, full repeal of the IRA’s energy provisions will be necessary to repair the damage that’s been done to our energy policy and to stop the costly spending.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1328805329-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:11:20.926405

The company will lean on exports and hybrid dominance as a buffer against slower-than-expected EV adoption in the American market.

A new battery factory in North Carolina will power the strategy, producing up to 300,000 EV batteries annually at full capacity.

Toyota Motor Corp. has been moving cautiously on electric vehicle (EV) production but it is shifting gears. It's preparing to launch two U.S.-made all-electric models next year, adding to its growing lineup of EVs and signaling a deeper investment in electrification — even as it hedges with hybrids and global exports.

By mid-2027, Toyota aims to offer seven EV models in U.S. showrooms. That includes two American-built vehicles, three imports arriving next year, and two already on the market: the bZ4X (soon to be renamed “bZ”) and the Lexus RZ.

Export strategy as market insurance

Toyota executives remain wary about EV demand in the U.S., where battery electric vehicles accounted for just 8% of sales in 2024. Toyota sold fewer than 30,000 fully electric cars domestically last year — a fraction of competitors like Tesla and Hyundai.

To manage risk, the automaker plans to tap overseas markets to absorb potential U.S. oversupply. It typically only adds a vehicle to a factory lineup if confident in 100,000–150,000 units in annual sales, meaning export flexibility is key.

That outlook could be complicated by geopolitical factors. Any trade conflict sparked by President Trump’s proposed tariffs could disrupt Toyota’s international supply and export plans.

Battery power from the heartland

At the core of Toyota’s electrification strategy is a sprawling battery facility in Liberty, North Carolina. Spanning 1,850 acres, the plant will begin shipping lithium-ion cells later this year. Ten of its 14 production lines are dedicated to EV batteries, with the rest focused on hybrids.

When fully operational, the site will support the production of more than 30 gigawatt-hours annually — enough to power 800,000 hybrid vehicles, 150,000 plug-in hybrids, and 300,000 all-electric vehicles.

The factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to come online next month, with additional lines launching through 2034.

U.S. plants gear up for EV transition

Toyota’s two major American factories are also pivoting:

Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota’s largest global plant, will host one of the new electric models. It currently produces top-selling vehicles like the Camry (now hybrid-only), the RAV4 (soon ending gasoline-only versions), and the Lexus ES.

Princeton, Indiana, where large models like the Highlander, Grand Highlander, and Sienna are built, will produce another new EV model — though Toyota hasn’t disclosed what it will be.

Meanwhile, three new imported EVs will hit U.S. dealerships next year: the bZ Woodland, a new CH-R crossover, and an all-electric version of the Lexus ES.

Catching up without giving in

Toyota’s strategy reflects both urgency and restraint. Once a skeptic of aggressive EV mandates, the company has become more vocal about letting the market dictate pace.

For now, Toyota’s hybrid dominance — with nearly 80% of U.S. sales already electrified in some form — provides a strong foundation. But as the EV era accelerates, Toyota’s new investment signals it’s no longer content to trail the pack.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/lexusrz-ca-2025.webp,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:28.208839

Lawrenceville, Ill. — May 28, 2025 — Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA’s Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company’s broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)’s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

“This project is a testament to what’s possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,” said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. “From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we’re proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.”

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL’s manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA’s largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

“We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we’re taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,” said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. “We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.”

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We’re proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project’s final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

“This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,” said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. “Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.”

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA’s own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an “energy community,” designated due to the area’s unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

“From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,” said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. “The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.”

Since The Inflation Reduction Act Passed Three Years Ago, NY Companies Have Announced Over $5 BILLION In Clean Manufacturing Investments Creating Thousands Of Good-Paying Jobs From Long Island To Buffalo; Senator Warns What Will Happen If GOP Doesn’t Back Off Plan To Kill Clean Energy And Manufacturing

Schumer: Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Is An Ugly Mess That Means Bigger Electric Bills & Big Job Losses For New York

Just a week after House Republicans passed Trump’s devastating bill to kill clean energy incentives so they could give tax breaks to billionaires, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer revealed how tax hikes on clean energy tucked in the bill would be a gut punch to New York’s economy.

Schumer said new data studies from NERA Economic Consulting shows that repealing the clean energy tax credits could cause New York to lose up to 20,300 jobs as clean energy projects are cancelled or scaled back due to lack of incentive, with a whopping nearly $3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP and New Yorkers paying up to $650 in higher energy costs each year by 2032 if these devastating cuts become law.

“Higher energy bills and many thousands fewer jobs, that’s what New York gets under Trump’s reckless tax bill, which is a giveaway to billionaires and corporations. Already, thousands of New Yorkers were making improvements to their homes to lower their electric bills and make their homes warmer in the harsh winters, now they lose all that support. Thousands of new jobs building clean energy projects in every corner of the state and bringing manufacturing back from China will all be vaporized by the GOP's ugly budget bill. It is a gut punch to New York and a gift to China, which wants to dominate clean energy manufacturing,” said Senator Schumer. “Losing these clean energy projects means losing cheaper electricity for families and businesses. We need more energy production from many sources including wind and solar and water; we need America to be energy independent and to manufacture clean energy technology here, not overseas, and eliminating these tax credits radically and irresponsibly rolls back all the progress we have made in recent years. It turns America’s clean energy boom into a bust.”

Schumer explained that the bill which passed the Republican House last week would kill clean energy incentives created in the Inflation Reduction Act, these tax credits are already benefiting hundreds of New York businesses with ongoing projects and families who are using them to help improve their homes and lower their electric bills. These cuts are broad and deep to New York’s clean energy sector, Schumer specifically highlighted how the bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families in New York up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have ensured a robust buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

Eliminates the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit that supports American-made clean hydrogen, led by New York companies like Plug Power and Air Products, to be used for clean manufacturing and agriculture.

Schumer said that clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act have created the biggest clean energy boom in American history, but now with many of these core provisions being clawed back or eliminated it risks all the progress that has been made in New York and across the country. The senator said if NY energy projects are forced to stop or scale back, energy costs would increase for families and businesses across the country. With electricity demand surging in New York and across the country, clean energy sources like wind and many other sources of clean power are often the most efficient sources of new electricity, much cheaper than traditional alternatives like natural gas and oil. NERA Economic Consulting estimates costs for New York families could increase by $650 a year, as the Republican plan to gut the clean electricity production and investment tax credits makes it more expensive to provide more electricity, while simultaneously killing the Residential Clean Energy and Energy Efficient Home Improvement tax credits makes it more costly for families to make their homes more efficient and reduce their energy bills.

Schumer added, “Democrats are united in opposing this cruel and counterproductive bill, and these ill-conceived elimination of energy tax credits so they can put more money in the pockets of billionaires. We need the GOP to block these cuts, otherwise it will be American families and our manufacturing future paying the price.”

The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives have spurred over $5 billion worth of investments in clean manufacturing in New York, creating over 7,200 jobs. Schumer said if this House Republican plan goes through, many of the clean energy projects spurred by the IRA could be forced to scale back or even stop and the workers building the future of American energy would be laid off, and projects that otherwise would have come online will never come to fruition. That would impact both major NY employers and manufacturers in the clean energy, manufacturing, electric vehicle, battery, research sector and our small businesses. One example is Geothermal Works in the Hudson Valley, a small Westchester based family business with that helps homes get updated with heat pumps and geothermal systems to lower their electric costs, who said that if the current clean energy cuts go through in the GOP bill it would shutter their business and force them into early retirement.

Below are just some examples of projects spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act in New York State that show why eliminating these provisions could be so harmful:

Off Long Island, Equinor invested $5 billion in building a massive offshore wind farm project, Empire Wind, that will provide power for hundreds of thousands of homes in New York State, and is supported by tax credits for offshore wind projects created by the Inflation Reduction Act .

In the Capital Region, Plug Power invested $125 million in a new green hydrogen fuel cell factory in 2023, creating new good paying jobs to boost production of clean hydrogen fuel cells with support from the Fuel Cell Production Tax Credit. Additionally, the company is poised to harness the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, to spur further growth both in the Capital Region and at Plug’s Henrietta, NY Gigafactory in the Finger Lakes that manufactures Electrolyzers. GE Vernova invested $50 million in a new manufacturing line for its onshore wind business in 2023, hiring 200 new workers with support from a production tax credit for U.S. wind turbine manufacturing created by the Inflation Reduction Act.

In Western New York, Viridi Parente a fast growing company on Buffalo’s East Side has added hundreds of good-paying jobs growing the domestic battery manufacturing industry with support from clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act, such as the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. Solar Liberty Energy Systems and PanelClaw are installing thousands of solar panels at homes and businesses. Solar Liberty Energy Systems is helping customers navigate available federal clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the burden of installation costs while PanelClaw is producing racking systems with help from the American Domestic Manufacturing Bonus tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since Trump was elected, approximately $14 billion worth of manufacturing projects have been outright cancelled, representing more than 13,000 jobs lost. If the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy goes through, those cancellations could balloon to threaten more than $800 billion in private investment in domestic clean energy made in the past three years across the country, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. NERA Economic Consulting estimates that New York could lose an estimated 20,300 jobs if these tax breaks are killed. Schumer said the House Republican bill would repeal the very parts of the Inflation Reduction Act that have helped companies grow in New York and spurred millions of investments, many of which are in Republican districts.

Repealing the clean energy tax incentives would also be a disaster for America and Schumer said that would cede energy manufacturing leadership to China, which already produces a significant amount of the world’s clean technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. If companies can no longer support clean energy manufacturing in the United States, they will bring these projects to America’s competitors, and jobs that would’ve otherwise been created in America will be created in countries like China. This will destabilize American supply chains and make American families and businesses reliant on China for cheap energy.

“No matter which way you slice it, the House Republican bill is bad news for New Yorkers. Shutting down projects, killing jobs, and increasing electricity bills would be devastating for our state, which is why we need Republicans to stand up to this bill to save investments in homegrown American energy,” concluded Schumer.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

The story has been corrected to reflect Hitachi’s energy arm is building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia, not transmission and electrification operations.

PurposeEnergy, which specializes in converting organic food waste into energy, has officially opened a high-tech anaerobic digestion facility that began exporting power to the Vermont grid in December 2024. The project broke ground in May 2023 and marks PurposeEnergy’s first big move since being acquired by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners in April 2023. Quinbrook fully funded the St. Albans facility.

A key player in this project is Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont ice cream giant signed a long-term feedstock deal with PurposeEnergy in 2021. Now, all of Ben & Jerry’s high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products are sent straight from its factory to the new facility through a dedicated pipeline.

“This project strengthens Ben & Jerry’s commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,” said Jenna Evans, the company’s global sustainability manager. “It will reduce Vermont’s road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease phosphorus pollution.”

The plant sits on land purchased from the Franklin County Industrial Development Corporation and is expected to produce 8.75 million kWh of renewable electricity annually. That clean power is sent to the Vermont grid through the state’s Standard Offer program, which supports the deployment of small-scale renewable energy projects.

The plant also recovers up to 45,000 million Btu of renewable thermal energy annually, which helps heat the digester and run operations.

“It’s a model of industrial symbiosis – turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies,” said Erik Lallum, PurposeEnergy’s chief development officer.

PurposeEnergy says the new facility could help attract more food manufacturing businesses to the St. Albans Industrial Park by offering a sustainable, onsite waste management solution that doubles as a clean energy source.

The court ruled in favor of an alliance of local counties that support the project, called the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, concluding that the federal environmental review process did not have to consider potential broader, indirect impacts.

The conservative-majority court was unanimous on the bottom line, although the three liberal justices differed on the reasoning. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case.

The court ruled that consideration of broader downstream impacts of the project were not required under a federal law called the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court, said some federal judges have incorrectly applied NEPA and allowed it to be used as a broad weapon to challenge major development projects.

""NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents ... to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,"" he wrote.

This has the effect of delaying projects for years, Kavanaugh said.

""Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line,"" he added. ""Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary.""

Environmental groups that had challenged the railroad's approval decried the ruling, with Sam Sankar, a lawyer at Earthjustice, saying it undermined precedent that said federal agencies should ""look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment.""

Although the coalition won at the Supreme Court, the project still has to undergo further review by the federal Surface Transportation Board before it can move forward.

The railroad would bring oil from the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah by connecting the area to the national rail network.

""It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability,"" said Keith Heaton, the coalition's director.

The opposition to the project was led by Eagle County, Colorado, which claims it will suffer from downstream effects of the railroad, and several environmental groups.

The county's lawyers said it would be directly affected by the project, with 9 out of every 10 trains that use the new railroad eventually passing through it on an existing line that runs along the Colorado River.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who also opposes the plan, said in a statement that NEPA should require ""projects to be fully informed of all potential environmental hazards before shovels go into the ground.""

The Surface Transportation Board conducted an environmental review and gave the railroad the green light to move forward.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found flaws in the analysis as well as other parts of the approval process, and in a 2023 ruling sent it back to the agency for further review.

The case arose as NEPA has faced criticism for unnecessarily slowing down major projects.

In 2023, then-President Joe Biden signed new legislation that sought to streamline the process. It requires agencies to only consider ""reasonably foreseeable"" climate impacts and limits reports to 150 pages.

Gorsuch stepped aside after the court had agreed to hear the case, citing the court’s ethics rules. Liberal groups and more than a dozen members of Congress had urged him to recuse himself over his previous links to billionaire Philip Anschutz.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250416-utah-oil-railway-2023-ac-1142p-0d6b0b.jpg",N,,2025-05-29 16:11:24.582118

Climate-friendly trade deals must incentivize industries to advance, not encourage industries to stagnate.
Climate-friendly trade deals require new rules that reward each country’s transition to a clean energy economy, including the creation of good-paying jobs and environmental protection.","President Trump and his administration are rushing to broker new trade deals and revisit existing ones, unveiling that the real purpose of Trump’s chaotic tariff threats was to open up our jobs and communities to the harmful consequences of more trade rather than trying to bolster American industries.

The administration has announced it is working on new agreements with the United Kingdom, China, and dozens of other countries, including those with terrible records on pollution, human rights, and workers rights, without the input of Congress and the American people. New trade agreements are not the only concern, however. Trump is likely to use the review of the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), to make the deal work even better for corporations and polluters.

We cannot let this secretive approach to trade policy go on. The global trade model is broken. The current rules that govern trade between countries pad the pockets of corporate CEOs while encouraging the exploitation of workers and the environment. Consumers may have more access to “stuff” — but lowering the barriers to global trade has not improved our wellbeing. Decades of bad trade policy led to a decline in American manufacturing and the outsourcing of thousands of good-paying American jobs, while increasing pollution and corporate profiteering overseas.

We need a new model for trade that propels us into the future — one that bolsters environmental protections, provides good-paying jobs, and ensures sustainable supply chains. As the Trump Administration sits down with other countries to hash out new trade deals with the goal of bringing back jobs and securing supply chains, it presents a pivotal opportunity to insist on a new set of guardrails for climate-friendly trade deals that create jobs and protect people and the planet.

The Sierra Club played a pivotal role in speaking up for the environment during the negotiations of the original NAFTA agreement in the early 1900s, and again in speaking up for major reforms to the North American trade pact during the negotiations for the USMCA, aka NAFTA 2.0, during Trump’s first term. Now we’re committed to again fighting alongside you to push for a new model for trade that prioritizes the environment and sustainability to lift up fenceline communities and American jobs.

A vision for climate-friendly trade

So, what exactly does a climate-friendly trade deal look like — one that creates jobs and protects people and the planet? Here are several requirements:

Trade agreements must have binding environmental standards. In most trade deals, governments are “encouraged” to uphold environmental laws in their country, as well as any commitments each country has made under international treaties. However, climate-friendly trade deals must not see environmental protection as optional, but rather as key to prosperity and security. Trade deals must create steadfast commitments that each country protects against pollution and exploitation of the natural world.

Trade agreements must be able to enforce these environmental obligations. The current rules that govern trade deals unfortunately lack any pathways for meaningful enforcement of a trade deal’s environmental provisions, which means that even if an agreement creates environmental obligations on paper, governments can let companies off the hook for meeting strict pollution limits without impacting trade relationships. Enforcement makes environmental obligations stick — and any new or revised trade deals must include strong and meaningful enforcement tools.

Trade agreements must establish common practices and tools to help governments enforce these environmental obligations. In particular, each country must establish and utilize the same standards for reporting on the pollution impacts of individual factories and polluting facilities like power plants. This will ensure any new or revised trade deals can be used as tools to streamline manufacturing processes and modernize economies, including how countries make essential goods, produce energy, and move things from place to place. Climate-friendly trade deals must require cooperation and coordination on pollution reporting so all countries operate from a common understanding.

Trade agreements should reward innovators. Our outdated trade model has allowed companies to move their manufacturing to countries where the cost of doing business is cheapest.This process is known as “offshoring” jobs and pollution, and it rewards countries whose industries lean on cheap and outdated manufacturing practices and exploitative supply chains. Tools like pollution dumping fees — require importers to pay an additional fee on particularly pollution-intensive goods — can help ensure that companies that take financial risks to modernize have a fair shot in the global marketplace. Climate-friendly trade deals must incentivize industries to advance, not encourage industries to stagnate.

Trade partners must agree not to challenge each other’s climate plans. This includes agreements not to threaten each other’s green climate policies that create green jobs and make investments in transforming polluting industries. Our outdated trade model makes it easy for one government to target another government’s climate policies on the grounds that those climate policies made trade less fair. Climate-friendly trade deals require new rules that reward each country’s transition to a clean energy economy, including the creation of good-paying jobs and environmental protection.

Tell your representatives to prioritize climate-friendly trade

The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead on negotiating deals with countries all over the world.

After losing their biggest export market due to Donald Trump’s trade wars, U.S. farmers are now counting on the president’s support for biofuels to prevent their next crop from piling up in storage.

The administration is set to soon unveil a plan for how much crop-based biofuels will be blended into fossil fuels starting next year. A higher mandate, still opposed by some in the oil industry, would create a much needed outlet for crops after tariffs hit China — the top commodities buyer simply has no orders for corn, soybeans or wheat from the next harvest on its books, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is also president of the American Soybean Association, said of the upcoming biofuels mandate. “I can store one good crop; I can’t store multiple years.”

Trump instigated a $28 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the economic standoff with Beijing during his first term. While his administration is considering similar plans again, so far he has only pledged to find domestic markets to compensate for lost sales abroad.

Boosting demand at home is a key priority for growers, industry groups and some of the top agricultural commodity traders. That’s because overseas sales of soybeans from the next crop are currently running 79% below the average of the past five years, USDA data showed. Corn sales are 49% lower.

The U.S. farm economy was already struggling before Trump’s trade disputes. Bumper crops globally boosted supplies and sent a Bloomberg gauge of grain prices tumbling more than 40% since a 2022 peak.

For Trump and the Republican party, reinforcing the farmer vote ahead of next year’s midterm elections will be key. American growers have been a loyal constituency, but some cracks in that support have started to emerge.

An AgWeb poll of almost 3,000 farmers earlier this year revealed that 54% were against Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating strategy. A group of growers from Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi also sued the administration after the USDA canceled grants under a program to install solar panels.

The April Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer found that 56% of respondents expect tariffs to have a negative or very negative impact on farm income this year. Still, 70% said the policy will strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy in the long-term.

Domestic demand

“If we’re going to get behind this America First policy, let’s make sure that we have a great domestic policy strategy,” said Lucas Lentsch, a North Dakota farmer who heads the United Soybean Board. “Let’s make sure we’ve got good demand here at home.”

Creating more markets at home is easier said than done. The U.S. cattle herd is already at the lowest since the 1950s, curbing demand for crops in feed rations. That’s leaving farmers reliant on the so-called renewable volume obligation, or RVOs — a rule that’s been controversial since being enshrined into law two decades ago to safeguard energy security.

Farmers benefit from a higher biofuels mandate, but oil refiners have historically opposed it. Some of that has since changed as Big Oil invested in biofuels in recent years as part of their decarbonization efforts.

“We need a robust RVO to keep U.S. soybeans a profitable business to be in,” said Greg Anderson, who grows the oilseed in Nebraska.

Agribusiness giants Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Bunge Global SA and Cargill Inc., as well as trade groups including the Clean Fuels Alliance America want the Environmental Protection Agency to set the RVO at no less than 5.25 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel starting next year, up 60% from 2025 levels.

Farm lobby groups and U.S. Midwestern governors also want a mandate for U.S. ethanol of at least the 15 billion gallons currently in place.

The American Petroleum Institute is also backing the requests.

“We’re certainly doing our job to push administration to help us and help the industry,” Christopher Cuddy, ADM’s president of carbohydrate solutions, said at a BMO conference in New York this month. “The most encouraging piece for me is the fact that we’re aligned with the Petroleum Institute, which at least in my time has never happened.”

Still, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents some refiners, is against it. The group argues the U.S. isn’t selling enough gasoline to absorb so much ethanol and that there’s uncertainty over the amount of feedstock available to produce more renewable diesel and other biomass-based biofuels.

The biofuels industry disagrees. Randall Stuewe, chief executive officer of Darling Ingredients Inc., said the previous quotas set under former President Joe Biden were far too low. The company’s Diamond Green Diesel venture with Valero Energy Corp. is a top producer of renewable fuels.

That led to a number of factory closures. Biodiesel plants in the U.S. produced at just 51% of capacity in the year through April, while facilities that make renewable diesel — a fuel that’s chemically identical to its fossil fuel peer — ran at a rate of 72%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Project Tracker.

“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, U.S. president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj. “Some companies are reducing run rates or shelving their investment plans for renewable fuels,” which will make it harder to curb emissions from heavy-duty industries, he said.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.

In a statement to Bloomberg, the EPA said it has already sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House and will make it available for public comment once the proposal is signed.

The U.S. biofuels program “supports President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices,” the agency said.

A higher RVO is a chance to get domestic biofuels back up to normalized run rates of around 80%, said Brett Gibbs, a renewable energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who estimates the mandate will need to be at least 3.9 billion gallons to bring some facilities back online.

Trade uncertainty

It’s unclear how the EPA will balance the concerns of some refiners and the agriculture industry. And even as the president announced a truce with China, lowering tariffs for 90 days, uncertainty remains.

Sales of next season’s crops to Mexico and Japan, the second and third-largest soybean buyers, are lagging well behind historical levels for this time of year. And China continues to snap up supplies from rival Brazil.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has openly hinted at a bailout, and nearly two thirds of farmers in the March Purdue/CME barometer said aid was either likely or very likely. Still, many growers say they want to sell their crops instead of receiving aid.

“As a farmer, I’d rather receive it from the market,” said Philip Good, a Mississippi farmer who’s the chair of the United Soybean Board. “We go back to the domestic markets, and developing domestic uses.”

With zero carbon emissions, unmatched reliability, and growing private sector investment, nuclear energy can be the cornerstone for America’s clean, resilient, and competitive future.

A Nuclear Wake-Up Call from Washington

On May 23, 2025, the Trump administration issued a sweeping set of executive orders aimed at jumpstarting the U.S. nuclear energy industry. In a ceremony at the White House, the President announced directives for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to overhaul and streamline its approval process, aiming to license new reactors within just 18 months. Another order instructed the Departments of Energy and Defense to explore building reactors on federal lands, including military bases and data center sites.

The orders set an ambitious goal: quadruple the nation’s nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050. In doing so, the administration hopes to power an AI- and cloud-driven economy while cutting carbon emissions and bolstering U.S. energy independence.

But the proposals as you might expect are not without controversy. Some scientists and regulatory experts fear the orders could weaken safety oversight. Critics worry that consolidating power over the NRC under the White House may erode its independence. Still, the underlying signal is clear: nuclear power is back in the national spotlight—and I strongly agree that it’s time we take that seriously.

As a former US senator, physician, and Tennessean who has long championed science-based energy solutions at the federal and state level, I believe this moment presents a powerful opportunity. Done right—with safety, science, and transparency at the forefront—this could mark a turning point. The time to double down on nuclear is now.

The Case for Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy has long been at the center of energy debates since I entered the Senate in 1995, but its importance is becoming clearer than ever. As a carbon-free, high-capacity, and dependable power source, nuclear energy now provides half of America’s clean (carbon-free) electricity. Unlike wind and solar, which depend on fluctuating weather patterns, nuclear plants run at full capacity 93% of the time, far exceeding wind (33%) and solar (23%), promising a more consistent and large-scale energy supply.

The environmental benefits of nuclear power to our human health are undeniable. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, nuclear energy prevents 470 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year, equivalent to removing 100 million cars from the road. Interestingly, countries with strong nuclear programs have 19% lower carbon footprints than the global average. Irrespective of one’s view on climate change, less carbon in the air is better for your health and well-being.

Concerns over cost and nuclear waste management continue, but advancements in reactor technology are actively addressing both challenges. The ADVANCE Act (Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy), passed into law in 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support, is already streamlining reactor licensing, accelerating deployment, and cutting regulatory barriers. Meanwhile, small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors promise safer, more affordable, and faster-to-build nuclear energy solutions. The federal government’s $900 million investment in SMR technology underscores the confidence in this next-generation nuclear infrastructure.

With AI data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial expansion leading to a huge surge in U.S. energy demand, nuclear energy stands as the most scalable, carbon-free solution to meet these growing needs.

Planetary Health is Essential for Human Health

As a physician I look at planetary health through the lens of how it affects the health of individuals and their families. The changing climate with hotter days and increased weather extremes is not just an environmental issue; with advancing science we now know it is a serious public health concern as well. Record-breaking heat waves now occur annually, with over 1,200 deaths per year in the U.S. attributed to extreme heat. Asthma, heart attacks, and vector-borne diseases like Lyme and West Nile virus are all on the rise. Wildfires, fueled by higher temperatures, are blanketing communities in toxic smoke.

To more fully protect public health, we must reduce greenhouse emissions. Nuclear energy, which produces zero emissions during operation and has the potential to rapidly scale, is one of the most powerful tools we have to do so.

Favorable Public Opinion and Bipartisan Support is on the Rise

When I was in the Senate 20 years ago, public attitudes on nuclear energy were for the most part negative. That has dramatically changed. According to a 2024 survey, the percentage of Americans who “strongly” or “somewhat support” nuclear power rose from 49% to 61% between 2018 and 2022. While support dipped slightly in 2023, it rebounded to 55% in 2024, reflecting a growing recognition of nuclear power’s role in energy security and climate action.

Concerns over safety, waste disposal, and nuclear proliferation have steadily declined, though cost remains a primary public concern. However, the momentum in policy as reflected in last week’s executive orders and last year’s ADVANCE Act, investment (see below with private sector commitments), and innovation suggest that affordability challenges will be mitigated in the coming years.

In the Senate I learned that policy frequently follows public support, and that support is especially impactful if it is bipartisan. Bipartisan support for nuclear power is stronger than ever. The same 2024 survey found that 56% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans support nuclear expansion, a rare point of political agreement. This was seen in the passage of the ADVANCE Act last July, which received significant support from both parties. In the words of Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), then Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee:

“With the ADVANCE Act being signed into law, we secured a landmark win for the future of nuclear energy here in America. Getting substantive, bipartisan policy across the finish line isn’t always easy, but this is the result of years of work to build widespread consensus about the benefits of advanced nuclear reactors to our electric grid, economy, and environment.”

At the 29th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2024, more than 20 countries pledged to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, showing global confidence in nuclear energy as a critical tool for decarbonization. The return of Three Mile Island Unit 1 in Pennsylvania (Microsoft supported) and Palisades in Michigan, along with the completion of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia (the first newly built nuclear reactors in the US in over 30 years), signals that skepticism toward nuclear power is giving way to renewed optimism.

Tennessee’s Nuclear Legacy

I have followed nuclear issues in Tennessee for three decades, first in my years representing Tennessee in the Senate from 1995 until 2007, and now in my work to advance planetary health. The state’s relationship with nuclear energy runs deep. It was at Oak Ridge, during the Manhattan Project, where the modern atomic age was born. Oak Ridge National Laboratory remains a hub of innovation today, including work on advanced reactor designs, nuclear fuels, and safety technologies. And the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—created during the Great Depression to bring electricity and economic development to the region—was one of the earliest adopters of civilian nuclear power.

In fact, the first commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. to supply electricity to the grid was TVA’s Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in northern Alabama, just across the Tennessee border. Since then, TVA has become one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, running seven nuclear reactors at three sites: Watts Bar, Sequoyah, and Browns Ferry.

Today, nuclear provides nearly 40% of Tennessee’s electricity, making it the state’s largest single source of carbon-free power. It helps keep our grid reliable and our emissions lower—even as we electrify more of our economy.

On January 20, 2025, TVA announced an $800 million initiative to build small modular reactors (SMRs) statewide, with support from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. SMRs, being smaller than traditional reactors, offer enhanced safety, scalable design, and versatile deployment in remote areas or existing power grids. The first of these reactors are expected by 2033. Just this month, TVA became the first utility company in the United States to request a permit to construct a small modular reactor.

TVA is embracing public-private partnerships to address safety, affordability, and speed. Tennessee is showing the country what smart, collaborative, innovation-driven energy policy looks like.

The Data Center Boom and Tech Investment

We are on the cusp of a global energy explosion. By 2040, total electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to increase by 30%, with AI data centers alone expected to consume 8–10% of global power. According to Goldman Sachs, their energy consumption is projected to rise by 160% by 2030. These servers must run 24/7, with no downtime.

That means energy sources must be baseload—always on, unlike solar or wind. Nuclear can help fill that gap. Plants operate at over 90% capacity, more than any other energy source. They are ideal for powering industrial clusters, tech campuses, and secure defense operations.

We are seeing the tech giants making massive investments in nuclear energy:

• Microsoft is backing the recommissioning of Three Mile Island Unit 1 and Palisades.

• Google is investing in seven SMRs through Kairos Power, targeting 500 MW by 2035.

• Amazon has partnered with X-energy to develop 5 GW by 2039.

• Oracle has secured permits for three SMRs.

In addition, Major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, have also begun financing nuclear projects, a significant reversal from previous hesitations.

Global Nuclear Momentum

The U.S. helped pioneer nuclear energy—but we’re now falling behind.

China leads the world in reactor construction, building more reactors than the next six countries combined. It is developing fourth-generation reactor technology and dominates global nuclear patents. China’s ACP100 “Linglong One” small modular reactor, expected to be operational by the end of this year, is the world’s first land-based, commercial small modular reactor.

Finland is developing the world’s first deep geological repository for nuclear waste (called Onkalo), widely viewed as the most advanced and safest permanent waste solution in the world, while Sweden, France, and South Korea continue expanding their fleets.

Safety and Waste, Complicated but Manageable Challenges

Safety must remain paramount. After the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, U.S. regulators took bold steps to ensure no such incident would happen again. And they succeeded: since then, America’s nuclear fleet has operated with an exceptional safety record. Modern reactors feature passive cooling, redundant safety layers, and real-time monitoring. Nuclear has the lowest mortality rate per kilowatt-hour among major energy sources.

During my tenure in the Senate, the nuclear waste debate was front and center—dominated by Yucca Mountain and whether to proceed with construction and licensing, how to do so safely, and what to do in the meantime. We saw deep partisan divisions, but also a rare bipartisan urgency to find a long-term solution—one that, more than two decades later, remains unresolved.

Today, all of the commercial nuclear waste generated in the U.S. could fit on a single football field, stacked 30 feet high. It is currently stored safely on-site at reactor locations in dry casks, encased in steel and concrete. But as nuclear power expands, we’ll need a more robust and permanent solution.

In recent years, the Department of Energy has taken steps to reimagine its nuclear waste strategy. Its Office of Environmental Management released its Strategic Vision for 2024-2034 that emphasizes environmental and climate considerations and leans heavily on public-private partnerships. Yet this effort has not gone without scrutiny. The Government Accountability Office flagged key shortcomings, including a lack of comprehensiveness and inconsistencies with statutory requirements.

Still, there are signs of progress. We are seeing a shift toward greater transparency, shared responsibility, and collaboration between government, industry, and communities—all essential if we are to ensure public trust and long-term safety.

Innovations and Key Events Placing Progress in Perspective

As I engage on nuclear issues, I am frequently asked for some of the exciting things happening in the US. Here are some examples:

• The ADVANCE Act, passed in 2024, is streamlining licensing and accelerating deployment.

• Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 were completed in 2023 and 2024 respectively, becoming the first commercial reactors completed in the U.S. this century. Upon completion, Vogtle Unit 4 became the largest clean energy facility in the United States.

• The Natrium Project, an innovative nuclear facility proposal backed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, has received approval to replace a retired coal plant Wyoming.

• Deep Fission, a nuclear startup, is designing underground microreactors for data centers, aiming for operation by 2029.

• A $900 million federal initiative is funding SMR demonstrations to prove their economic feasibility.

• The Department of Energy is engaging in new international partnerships, such as the establishment of training centers in Poland and Ghana, which are expanding global nuclear expertise.

The Path Forward

To harness the full potential of nuclear energy, we must streamline the regulatory process and accelerate licensing for new plants and technologies. The ADVANCE Act was an important first step, but it’s just the beginning. We also need to invest boldly in research and development—supporting innovation that not only expands our energy capabilities but also improves how we manage nuclear waste.

Innovation alone isn’t enough. Public engagement and education will be key to building trust. And international collaboration, learning from global leaders and sharing best practices, will help ensure we get this right.

We live in a remarkable moment in history. Yes, there’s uncertainty. But there is also immense opportunity. The full potential of nuclear innovation has yet to be realized, and that should inspire optimism. By investing in nuclear energy and research, I believe we can secure a healthier, safer, and more economically resilient American future.

As a physician, I see the health consequences of air pollution and rising heat. As a policymaker, I see the urgency of real, science-based climate action. And as a Tennessean, I see a state that is showing the nation how to lead.

One proposal that has been receiving attention is expanding interprovincial electricity transmission.

Proponents emphasize economic efficiencies from energy trade, and the technical benefits of coupling wind and solar production with “natural batteries” in large hydro reservoirs.

Taking lessons from history, past nation-building infrastructure projects of a similar sort came up short in many ways, notably by failing to develop diversified technology systems.

To better ensure success this time, complementary, regional renewable energy and energy demand innovations must be made a priority.

Lessons from history

The transcontinental railway that linked east and west after Confederation protected Canada’s territorial integrity in reaction to American threats.

Yet, the project’s costs and the related national policy locked Canada into economic dependencies and failed to spur diversified industrial development.

Policymakers were more focused on building infrastructure than developing industrial research programs or education systems in new technologies and management techniques, as seen in Germany. Banks were more focused on financing resource extraction and large infrastructure than industrial development ventures.

Thus, Canada industrialized in a way that failed to foster domestic entrepreneurship and was dependent on American branch plants.

The pattern of big infrastructure pushes, in reaction to crises, failing to spur complementary development is recurrent in Canadian history.

Atlantic Canada’s undersea transmission link

Fast-forward more than a century and similar patterns continue to unfold.

In 2010, the provincial utilities in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador announced a plan to build an undersea transmission link connected to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the political drive to build the dam and transmission project prevented an independent assessment of alternatives, such as energy efficiency. The dam project ran significant cost overruns. Customers faced potentially large rate increases.

Today, policymakers are so focused on managing rate increases that they are neglecting new development opportunities such as allowing utilities to reduce customer bills by switching from oil to electricity for heating and transportation.

How to mandate clean heat in our buildings

Canada needs to accelerate its transition to renewable energy

The three-legged stool is the way to net zero by 2050

For a decade, Nova Scotia policymakers were over-dependent on the single megaproject to the detriment of domestic clean-energy solutions like energy efficiency and community-based renewables.

The Atlantic Loop, a proposed plan to bring hydroelectric power from Quebec to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, was eventually shelved. Only then was a greater focus placed on domestic energy demand management, storage, and renewables.

If the same policy dynamic is repeated, with cross-border megaprojects crowding out domestic clean-energy solutions for a decade, Canada will repeat its pattern of stifled technological development and fail to meet net-zero emission goals in time.

Enabling transformative technology systems

Transmission is only one component of a large technology system. To achieve a self-reliant and sustainable future it needs to be coupled with renewable energy and methods to shape demand and supply in real time.

Transition to sustainable energy introduces new technical challenges: electrifying home heating and vehicles could lead to spikes in demand during cold days or if everyone charges up their car at the same time.

Wind and solar energy generation rises and falls with the weather.

A flexible system that can ramp up and down would match renewable generation with demand and manage peaks. Transmission increases flexibility by connecting a wider diversity of energy resources across larger geographies.

Transmission needn’t work alone.

Adding solar generation can reduce the need to transmit electricity. Insulating buildings reduces electricity peaks.

In the same way, ratepayers and utilities can work together to pre-charge hot water tanks and pre-heat and pre-cool homes in advance of electricity peaks. Electric vehicles could charge when it makes the most sense for the grid.

Industrial operations can time large-scale energy demands to periods when renewables are plentiful and cheap.

Making energy demand more flexible and efficient means people and businesses that want to reduce their energy bills can even get compensated, improving both affordability and equity. In addition, homes and local communities can be protected from power outages.

(One example: Vermont is putting batteries in people’s homes instead of building transmission – the batteries balance supply and demand for the grid and can also be used by people if the power cuts out.)

Local renewable energy and demand-side flexibility resources can still face periods when they will generate more energy than they can use locally, or periods when local generators, energy efficiencies and storage can’t keep up with demand.

Concern about these demand-supply imbalances have led policymakers and utility managers to put the brakes on renewable-energy development or rely on non-renewable generators that use combustibles as back-up resources.

Interprovincial transmission and more local energy systems can complement one another. For instance, local grids could mostly balance hourly and daily ebbs and flows in demand and supply. Interprovincial transmission could manage seasonal differences by using wind and solar generation across the country to give time for hydroelectric reservoirs to fill up so they are ready for the winter heating season in a highly electrified future.

Policies should accelerate the energy transition

Policy choices will determine whether east-west-north electricity interconnections spur – or stifle – the development of multiple complementing clean technologies.

If transmission is given primacy as the favoured approach, it is more likely to crowd out other technologies and distract from solutions that are readily available. Conversely, policies that increase local renewable-energy development and electrification will show where transmission can be most effectively used to alleviate constraints that hold back local energy visions.

While building transmission takes years or decades, demand-side energy solutions can be deployed in months.

The creation of local, energy efficient “microgrids” across the country, capable of meeting their own energy needs most of the time is a national project to increase self-reliance that can start right now. Improving energy efficiency would better prepare for transmission by hedging against megaproject delays, easing peak demands that require electricity imports, and/or free up electricity for cross-border trading.

A national grid will be a successful accelerant for clean energy if it plugs into these microgrids with at-the-ready plans to use energy trade as a way to further accelerate local renewables and electrification.

If policymakers react to the current crisis by focusing solely on transmission megaprojects, they are likely to repeat a familiar Canadian pattern that will ultimately stifle technological development.

We don’t have to wait for transmission to improve energy self-reliance. A clean-energy superpower agenda should start by creating diverse local systems that will be complemented by a national grid.",https://policyoptions.irpp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Wordpress-A-national-grid-should-accelerate-–-not-stifle-–-the-energy-transition.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:11:12.874234

The United States is already facing a potential recession – we simply can’t afford to grind the clean energy economic engine to a halt.
Inflation Reduction Act Repeal Damage: Lost Jobs And GDP, Higher Energy Costs If the IRA is repealed by Congress, in 2030 our economy would lose nearly 790,000 jobs and $160 billion in GDP.
As fewer clean energy manufacturing facilities are built, construction activity dries up, costing jobs and cutting income across the board.
Texan homeowners will pay $8.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at more than $370 more in energy bills in 2035.","In 2022, Hyundai announced it was investing $5.5 billion to build a “Metaplant” manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries in Bryan County, Georgia. It promised more than 3,500 good-paying jobs first building the massive manufacturing facility, then making electric vehicles that cut consumer bills by providing cheaper transportation choices.

“This is the largest investment in the state of Georgia’s history, one that will diversify and expand our economy while providing strong job opportunities for Georgians today and for generations to come,” said Congressman Buddy Carter (GA-1).

When the Metaplant opened in October 2024, months ahead of schedule, it started shipping Hyundai Ioniq 5 EVs, the fourth-best selling EV in America. It also started generating millions in salaries, tax revenue, and economic activity across Southeast Georgia.

This is just one example of how the Inflation Reduction Act’s federal clean energy tax credits and government funding programs have supercharged America’s economy. Through January 2025 these policies have attracted $600 billion in new private investment across roughly 750 projects and created more than 406,000 new jobs.

But Trump administration proposals to repeal IRA federal policies to pay for tax cuts to benefit the wealthiest Americans – now being considered by Congress, which passed the IRA in 2022 – could halt this economic engine. That’s ironic considering 77% of the IRA’s clean energy and deployment investment have gone to Congressional districts represented by Republicans, and likely the reason 21 GOP Members of the House of Representatives oppose repealing them.

New Energy Innovation modeling shows that if the IRA is repealed, America’s economy and its households, will pay a staggering price. The United States is already facing a potential recession – we simply can’t afford to grind the clean energy economic engine to a halt.

Inflation Reduction Act Repeal Damage: Lost Jobs And GDP, Higher Energy Costs

If the IRA is repealed by Congress, in 2030 our economy would lose nearly 790,000 jobs and $160 billion in GDP. Between 2025 and 2035, American households would be forced to pay $32 billion in higher cumulative household energy bills. In 2035, we’d lose $190 billion from national GDP.

These economic damages would be a result of companies cancelling announced factories and expected private investment drying up as the federal government signals to corporations that America’s clean energy economy is no longer open for business. As fewer clean energy manufacturing facilities are built, construction activity dries up, costing jobs and cutting income across the board.

This economic slowdown isn’t theoretical. Hundreds of billions in private investment and state funds could be wasted on projects that may now be cancelled – more than 42,000 jobs and $57 billion in investment have already been stopped or stalled by Trump administration proposals since January 2025 alone.

And the economic slowdown isn’t surprising. Financial services company Moody’s analyzed President Trump’s campaign policy platform in June 2024 and found that it would increase inflation and weaken economic growth, threatening a recession as soon as mid-2025.

As fewer clean energy technologies like solar panels, EVs, and batteries are deployed, energy costs would rise as consumers are forced to pay volatile power prices from utilities and oil companies whose commodities are traded on a global market.

Average U.S. household electricity prices rose nearly 22% from 2018-2023, and could rise another 7% in 2025, especially if gas prices rise 91% by 2026 as predicted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

IRA repeal would throw fuel on that fire. A recent analysis for the right-leaning group ConservAmerica estimates repealing just two of the IRA’s tax credits would spike consumer electricity costs $51 billion annually by 2035. John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra, one of the country’s largest utilities warned, “if you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

America’s Biggest Losers From Inflation Reduction Act Repeal

Every state in the country would suffer economically if federal clean energy policies are repealed – they’d face higher consumer costs and job losses, along with lower GDP and less private investment. But five states would be America’s biggest losers, and they’re not liberal bastions.

Of all 48 states modeled, Texas is America’s biggest loser if federal clean energy policies are repealed, followed by California (the world’s fifth-biggest economy), Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

Texas, which has long been the country’s leader in coal and natural gas generation but also now gets the most electricity from wind and solar of any state, will suffer staggering economic losses in a repeal scenario. Texan homeowners will pay $8.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at more than $370 more in energy bills in 2035. The state will lose 115,000 jobs and GDP will fall $20.3 billion in 2035.

In California, where electricity bills have been increasing faster than inflation due to wildfire costs and volatile gas prices, families would be forced to pay $6.4 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at $180 per year in 2035. The state will lose out on 38,400 jobs and GDP will be $12.6 billion lower in 2035.

Florida, which is finally living up to its moniker as the Sunshine State by installing the second most solar energy of any state over the past five years, would pay $4.6 billion more in household energy spending from 2025-2035, peaking at $150 annually in 2035. 40,800 jobs would be stolen from workers in 2035, and GDP would drop $6.8 billion that year.

Georgia, one of the biggest beneficiaries in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing since 2022, would lose 28,600 jobs and $5.8 billion in GDP in 2035. Meanwhile, consumers would face $2.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at $180 per year in 2035.

In Pennsylvania, considered the biggest swing state in American politics, consumers would have to pay $2.1 billion more for energy across 2025-2035. The state would lose out on 29,000 jobs and $5.6 billion in GDP, both in 2035.

Why Throw Away America’s Economic Recovery?

Americans have the right to choose the cheapest energy technologies like solar energy and EVs instead of being forced to stay hooked on expensive and outdated forms of energy.

Clean energy was a $2 trillion global market in 2024, and abandoning that market means we cede economic opportunity to countries like China while factories once again close their doors and workers lose their jobs.

The policy choices Congress makes today will reverberate across our economy for decades. Repealing policies that create jobs, fight inflation, and increase GDP isn’t how we do business in this country. Or, at least, it’s not how we should do things.",https://energycentral.com/sites/all/themes/ece2016/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-05-29 17:11:28.263691

The auto giant overtook Tesla, which has ruled Canada's EV sales charts for years.

During Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, GM sold more electric cars than Tesla in Canada.

Tesla has lost its spot as the best-selling electric car brand in Canada, making way for General Motors to come in and take the crown.

The information went relatively under the radar and was spotted by GM Authority in an Instagram post from GM Canada, which claimed the company is now the country’s best-selling EV maker.

A GM spokesperson said that the claim is “based on Canadian vehicle registrations for the third quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025,” and that “the data shows GM as the number one EV seller in Canada over that period.”

In the last quarter of 2024, GM sold roughly 15,000 EVs in Canada, while the first quarter of this year saw sales of about 6,000 EVs, according to the company’s records. In Tesla’s case, the automaker doesn’t release sales numbers for individual countries every month.

That said, data from Quebec’s vehicle registration service (SAAQ), quoted by Global News, shows a severe drop in registrations for Tesla. In Canada’s largest market for EVs, Tesla went from 5,097 cars registered in Q4 2024 to just 524 in Q1 2025, a 90% decrease. Data for the whole country is not yet available.

Both companies saw their registration numbers go down at the beginning of this year because the Canadian government stopped its iZEV rebate program for battery-powered cars in February. At the same time, Quebec halted its regional incentive program during February and March.

It’s also worth noting that General Motors managed to overtake Tesla in Canada thanks to its extensive brand portfolio. The American automaker has three brands selling EVs in Canada, while Tesla is a single entity with just four models on offer, and only two of them are high-volume vehicles. However, this hasn’t stopped it from being the favorite choice among EV buyers in Canada in the past.

Now, though, Canadians aren’t particularly keen on getting behind the wheel of a new Tesla. That has a lot to do with Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, who said that “Canada is not a real country.” Combined with the U.S. and Canada's ongoing tariff war, Canadians aren't too enthusiastic about a company controlled by the President's right-hand man. That's bad news for Tesla and, apparently, good news for GM.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/xqA0b6/s1/gm-claims-it-s-now-the-best-selling-ev-maker-in-canada.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 15:11:12.328309

An additional $1.5 billion in newly found cancelled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.
More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.
April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico.
Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized.","Businesses cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in clean energy and clean vehicle factories since January, amid rising fears over the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy, according to E2’s latest analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

In April alone, companies canceled $4.5 billion in investments in new battery, electric vehicle and wind projects in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits. An additional $1.5 billion in newly found cancelled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.

As the Senate prepares to take up the legislation, E2’s analysis shows that more than 10,000 announced jobs have already been canceled amid concerns over the advance of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.

Through April, over 61 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy. Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states - including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.

April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized. Nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

But that same adaptation that gave them a leg up is now making them a target as the climate changes and there are fewer days with snow on the ground.

UW Madison Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology Professor Jonathan Pauli explains their change in fur color isn’t driven by cold temperatures and snow, but by the length of daylight.

“What that means then is that these snowshoe hares are still turning white, but they're turning white before the snow actually falls, so they are now mismatched with their background, and they stick out in these forests like a bright, white light bulb, and are very vulnerable then to predation,” said Pauli.

Winter-Adapted Species

As result of this climate change, snowshoe hares are moving farther and farther north.

Pauli’s research has found that about every 10 years their populations contract to the north by about five miles.

“When we begin then to project into the future with increasingly shorter and shorter snow seasons, we're predicting that the snowshoe hare distribution in the state is going to become even smaller and really just held out at the most northern reaches of our state,” he said.

Part of Pauli’s work has been focused on how snowshoe hares can survive these changes.

He and his colleagues have found that habitat is key.

If snowshoe hares have 10-acre or so stands of early aspen and alder, then they appear to have just as high of survival rates as hares whose fur color matches their background.

“You could really erode the consequence of that mismatch, i.e., erode the consequence of climate change,” said Pauli.

There’s been similar findings when it comes to ruffed grouse, another species that’s been well-adapted to snowy winters with thicker feathers and the ability to roost in the snow.

“They are species that will kind of cycle, and they'll kind of go up and down in their population numbers, but what we started seeing, especially in parts of central and southern Wisconsin, is that they're not rebounding when they sort of show these population declines,” said Benjamin Zuckerberg. “We are actually beginning to see that these declines are becoming more and more chronic, and because of that, we're seeing some of these populations beginning to sort of blink off.”

Zuckerberg is a professor at UW Madison’s Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology. He and Pauli have worked closely on winter-adapted species research.

Like the hare, Zuckerberg’s research has found that habitat can help in areas with a lack of snow.

Aspen stands and conifer cover can provide a similar buffer to the elements that burrowing under the snow does.

Zuckerberg says it then becomes a matter of working with land managers on growing the habitat to meet the needs, both now and into the future.

“This is a big part of what we do in terms of trying to incorporate what sort of future winters will look like. If we can incorporate some of those models and we say, ‘Okay, these are populations that might be more or less exposed to these changes in the future, what can we do in terms of being able to prioritize management in some of those areas?’” said Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg and Pauli’s work involved collaborating with different agencies, organizations, and various landowners.

Midwest Climate Adaptation Science Center

It also fell under the Midwest Climate Adaptation Science Center, one of nine regional consortiums in the U.S. working to figure out how natural and cultural resources can adapt to climate change.

“It's a tremendous tool for pursuing adaptation science, because it organizes all these organizations and these people associated with them around a common theme, a common infrastructure, and provides a sort of mission and purpose to those people that orients them towards the development of adaptation solutions and putting them into practice with managers across the region,” said Jessica Hellmann, she’s the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota and serves as the director of the consortium that makes up the Midwest CASC.

The CASC is made up of six universities, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Nature Conservancy, and falls under the USGS.

The research ranges from walleye fisheries to wild rice to the spread of invasive species.

In addition to projects done as a center, the CASC also awards grants to more research projects, and supports the professional development of new researchers.

“We have graduate students that we're training. We're building this future workforce,” said Hellmann.

The CASCs were created by Congress. The Midwest CASC broke off from the Northeast CASC in 2021 to focus more regionally on eight states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

The core funding for all the CASCs falls under the USGS, specifically the Ecosystem Mission Area or EMA.

Hellmann explained that the other partners, like the Universities, are typically providing in-kind funds.

“They're contributing specific dollars. They're adding graduate fellowships. So the investment from the federal government is being matched by investment from other places,” she said.

Cuts to USGS

Science Magazine reported in April that the Trump Administration planned to ask Congress to erase the EMA from the USGS budget. The Trump Administration is also planning to lay off about 1,000 employees within the EMA, but that’s been put on pause as of May 23 by a federal judge.

“That's worrisome. We think a lot about we are partly the federal government, and those of us who don't work for the federal government, we really rely on our federal partners to get our science done and to get that science implemented,” said Hellmann.

The Fiscal Year 2026 budget priorities released by the White House earlier this month doesn’t specifically list the EMA, but it does call for $564 million in cuts to USGS “programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”

Hellmann says it’s not her job to allocate money, but she knows the important value of the work they’re doing.

“We are pursuing science that doesn't exist. We haven't needed to adjust our management practices to a changing climate in the past, so we don't have a body of work to know what to be doing,” said Hellmann. “We need to be doing new science and then putting that science into practice. If that were to go away, that body of work in principle, would diminish or decline, and we would see it on the landscape in our natural and cultural resources over time.”

Both Pauli and Zuckerberg know the work the Midwest CASC does is important, with Zuckerberg saying losing it would have a crippling effect on science and the ability to translate science into action.

“I think that's a real disservice, obviously, that we are working hard, and in many cases, working with people on the ground, either agencies like the Wisconsin DNR or tribal partners, and in many cases, private landowners who are just looking to kind of gain more information about what they are seeing on their own properties and how to actually manage for it,” said Zuckerberg.

From the May/June 2025 Issue

The automotive industry is being pushed and pulled in many directions, creating a new landscape for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers as they consider their footprint strategies. There are many factors shaping this new landscape, including the accelerated but gradual shift to electrification, as well as geopolitical policy considerations, particularly the evolving trade policy in the United States. Notably, the rise in market demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has led to massive investments in EV manufacturing. According to some measures, global electric car sales were six times higher in 2023 than they were in 2018. That rise has coincided with the recent threat and implementation of tariffs over the past several months under the Trump administration, casting a degree of uncertainty for manufacturers and suppliers over how levies on fully assembled vehicles, components, and raw materials like aluminum and steel will impact production and supply chains.

Taken together, these shifts represent a new landscape to navigate for manufacturers and suppliers in the automotive industry, including those looking to expand or set up operations in the U.S. from overseas. It’s critical for automotive industry practitioners to stay up to date on the administration’s rapidly evolving stance on trade and tariffs. This may involve adjusting supply chains; pursuing more automation solutions; shifting production or assembly to the U.S., specifically in U.S. submarkets where the cost of doing business is lower; or leveraging tools to help companies minimize costs such as foreign trade zones (FTZs) and state and local business expansion incentives.

Here are some key takeaways for manufacturers and suppliers.

Navigating A Shift To Electric

Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs don’t require as many complex components, broadening the supplier base. That’s because the less complex componentry means there are a lot more companies manufacturing similar products. Suppliers to the automotive industry have to quickly adapt, innovate and develop new products to stay relevant, particularly companies that manufacture components used exclusively for internal combustion engine vehicles.

Much of the demand for EVs was initially caused by consumer demand and governmental policies, including consumer incentives. In recent years, demand and government mandates have swayed, and the market prognosis for the future of EVs remains even more uncertain. Unfortunately, given that the automotive cycle requires suppliers to invest five to eight years in advance of when their products will be sold to the consumer, it is more challenging to plan new products and, subsequently, where to build these products. For example, cars coming off the assembly line today began design and development five to eight years ago. Many companies may elect to pause decisions for new greenfield plants while they modernize existing facilities to produce internal combustion, hybrid and EV products in the same facility.

Tariffs Add Layer Of Complexity

In early March, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and increased tariffs on Chinese imports. He later imposed and then paused sweeping global tariffs. Over the past several weeks, the president has issued a number of tariff updates, including ones that directly impact the automotive industry. In early April, a 25% tax on imported vehicles went into effect. This is impacting the automotive industry by increasing costs and cutting into profit margins but also making foreign automakers reevaluate their U.S. sales strategies. For manufacturers and suppliers, companies must consider both short- and long-term impacts of the tariffs to determine if supply chains and production facilities need to be shifted, consolidated or simply left alone.

Recent tariffs on aluminum and steel products add even more complexity to the automotive industry. If elevated tariffs on steel and aluminum products persist, OEMs will be forced to source locally, which is not easily accomplished in the short term, or absorb or pass on the extra cost of tariffs to consumers. The rapidly shifting U.S. tariff landscape complicates this even more.

OEMs and suppliers must remain flexible to navigate the evolving automotive industry. This requires strategic investments in facilities, equipment and processes to adapt quickly to market shifts. To mitigate tariff impacts, companies should consider the following:

Tariff Engineering Evaluations. Use these to explore product modifications that reduce import duties. This may involve adjusting supply chains, shifting production or assembly to the U.S., or leveraging FTZs to minimize costs. If shifting production to the U.S., OEMs and suppliers should know that they can take advantage of existing expansion incentives that states and local communities provide for the automotive sector to help offset both upfront and ongoing facility operating costs.

Contract Provisions. Review contracts such as terms and conditions of sale and purchase, as well as supply agreements, to ensure there are proper force majeure clauses and pricing adjustment structures to lower the risk exposure to potential tariff increases, protecting long-term profitability.

Advocacy and Lobbying. Collaborate with trade associations and industry groups to advocate for favorable trade policies and reductions in tariffs.

Final Takeaways

The U.S. automotive industry has seen dramatic shifts in the last five years from the impact of the pandemic, the transition to EVs and now the implementation of tariffs. Any production and/or supply chain changes must have flexibility incorporated into the plans to allow companies to react quickly to rapidly changing cost, regulatory and consumer environments. Given the long-term planning necessary in the automotive industry and the competing impacts of potentially short-term tariffs, companies must exercise caution in decision-making to ensure any changes adopted can be altered if necessary. \

While state policies have made strides toward reducing public projects’ embodied carbon emissions, the embodied carbon emissions associated with private sector buildings remain significant and largely unregulated.
“SB25-182 is a practical, market-driven approach that accelerates the transition to sustainable building materials while mitigating any increase in building costs.
“SB-182 provides critical funding for incentives to support lower-carbon building materials, aligning with ongoing efforts within the concrete industry to advance sustainability.","DENVER — A bipartisan bill to incentivize embodied carbon emissions reductions for construction materials was signed into law by Governor Jared Polis. SB25-182 Embodied Carbon Emissions—sponsored by Senators Ball and Simpson, and Representatives Brown and Weinberg—seeks to reduce the emissions released during the sourcing and manufacturing of project materials like cement and steel.

Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gas emissions that occur when building materials are manufactured, transported, installed, maintained, and disposed of. It’s a key factor in a building’s carbon footprint and a significant driver of global warming, contributing to 11 percent of global buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions. While state policies have made strides toward reducing public projects’ embodied carbon emissions, the embodied carbon emissions associated with private sector buildings remain significant and largely unregulated.

Supporters of the legislation have the following comments:

“Colorado consistently ranks as one of the top 10 states for population growth and new commercial real estate development, which is why we must take construction-related greenhouse gas emissions seriously,” said Senator Ball, District 31, and prime sponsor of the bill. “We already lead the nation with innovative policies to cut emissions from buildings, and this legislation builds on that success by making it easier for private developers to use low-carbon materials. By expanding financing tools and incentives, we can ensure that Colorado’s dynamic construction sector drives progress towards our climate goals while creating demand for the highest quality, climate-positive materials—many of which are being developed and pioneered right here in the state.”

“As a representative of rural Colorado, I know how important it is to build a future where our towns can thrive,” said Senator Simpson, District 6 and prime cosponsor of the bill. “SB25-182 supports innovation in manufacturing which can help drive economic growth, ensuring our industries stay competitive. By leveraging existing financing tools, this bill supports job creation in Colorado’s industrial sector while aligning with smart, forward-looking economic policy.”

“Colorado has a responsibility to lead the way in tackling climate change, and that means addressing emissions in every sector—including construction,” said Representative Brown, District 12, and prime sponsor of the bill. “SB25-182 is a practical, market-driven approach that accelerates the transition to sustainable building materials while mitigating any increase in building costs. By making it easier for developers to choose low-carbon options, we can reduce emissions, support businesses, and ensure that our housing and development goals align with our state’s ambitious climate commitments.”

“This bill reflects a commonsense, market-based approach that encourages innovation without new mandates or overregulation,” said Representative Weinberg, House District 51. “By expanding access to voluntary financing tools, SB25-182 empowers private developers and manufacturers to lead in reducing emissions through American ingenuity—not government control. It’s a win for job creation, energy efficiency, and smart economic growth that keeps Colorado competitive.”

“This legislation is a valuable step to reduce embodied carbon emissions from building projects and supply chains,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “By expanding eligibility for two existing funding and financing programs—Colorado’s Industrial Tax Credit Offering (CITCO) and Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) financing program—this law creates new opportunities to advance innovative emissions reduction technologies. Addressing embodied carbon emissions in the building and industrial sectors is a key strategy in our holistic, nation-leading approach to achieve net-zero emissions in Colorado by 2050.”

“This legislation offers an opportunity to empower the private sector to invest in materials manufacturing practices and materials that prioritize the health of our communities and stability of our climate,” said Alana Miller, Colorado policy director at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “This new regulation will help Colorado meet its decarbonization goals and provide innovative leadership for other states to follow. Today, we have taken an important step when it comes to reducing the impact of our built environment.”

“The Colorado Ready Mixed Concrete Association is proud to support policies that promote responsible, forward-thinking solutions, and we look forward to collaborating with policymakers, industry partners, and stakeholders to drive meaningful progress,” said Todd Ohlheiser, executive director of the Colorado Ready Mixed Concrete Association. “SB-182 provides critical funding for incentives to support lower-carbon building materials, aligning with ongoing efforts within the concrete industry to advance sustainability. While our industry has made impressive reductions in our carbon footprint, we continue to innovate, investing in new technologies, materials, and practices that lower the carbon footprint of concrete while maintaining the durability and resilience that make it essential for construction.”

""Many industrial facilities in Colorado and across the United States are making major investments to reduce their carbon emissions. Policies like SB25-182 have the two-fold benefit of positively reinforcing this investment in emissions reductions while helping to keep our high-quality, union manufacturing jobs in the state and in the country,"" said Elena Santarella, BlueGreen Alliance state policy manager, Colorado. ""Increasing demand for lower embodied carbon products is a slam dunk policy that will benefit Colorado's industrial facilities and industrial communities.”

“SB 182 will enable property owners with projects using low carbon materials access to low-cost financing,” said Kevin Morse, managing director at Imperial Ridge Real Estate Capital, a leading national C-PACE capital provider. “This will help increase the value of their property and provide funding for climate friendly upgrades that include not just clean energy—but materials that reduce the carbon footprint of their building. By allowing embodied carbon to be included in C-PACE, Colorado would become the first state in the United States to make low-cost financing available for low carbon materials.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-29 14:10:20.305541

EVs significantly reduce air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and particulate matter in cities. Studies have shown that regions with high EV penetration see measurable improvements in local air quality, contributing to improved public health outcomes. For residents in high-traffic neighborhoods, this shift means fewer tailpipe emissions on their block, cleaner air to breathe and fewer respiratory issues tied to pollution.

Among the biggest advantages of electric vehicles is how efficiently they use energy. Gas-powered cars waste most of their fuel as heat—only about 12 percent to 30 percent actually moves the car. In contrast, EVs use over 75 percent of their energy to power the wheels. That means less waste and more mileage from the same amount of energy. Even when electricity comes from fossil fuels, EVs are still cleaner overall. On average, they deliver the emissions equivalent of 70 to 180 miles per gallon—far beyond what any gas car can match.

There are valid concerns about the carbon cost of battery manufacturing. Producing a typical EV battery emits between 2,400 and 16,000 kg of CO₂. This broad range can be attributed to numerous factors such as battery size, manufacturing location, energy sources used in production and the efficiency of supply chain and material extraction processes. On the flip side, the average gas-powered car emits roughly 43,500 kg of CO₂ over a standard 150,000-mile lifespan, a massive multiplier. Even in the worst-case scenario—battery production combined with coal-generated electricity—EVs still generate less lifetime carbon than ICE vehicles. In regions using cleaner energy mixes like solar or hydro, EV emissions can drop to less than half that of their gasoline counterparts.

Ownership costs also favor EVs. A 2024 Atlas Public Policy study found that EVs can save owners between $7,000 and $11,000 across the lifetime of the vehicle due to reduced fuel and maintenance costs. With fewer moving parts and regenerative braking systems, EVs have lower service requirements compared to ICE vehicles. While insurance premiums can be higher, the total cost of ownership is increasingly favorable, especially as battery prices fall and competition among automakers increases.

Range anxiety remains a barrier to adoption, but charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly. Public and private investment is increasing the number of fast-charging stations across the U.S., as more than 200,000 public charging ports are now available across the country, according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. In cities, the growth of on-street and garage charging stations is making EV ownership more practical for apartment dwellers and those without private driveways. Still, rural communities face slower rollout, and their EV adoption lags behind urban areas by 40 percent in the U.S. as a result. However, these areas often have the advantage of higher homeownership rates and detached housing, making it easier to install home chargers.

Policy also plays a critical role in accelerating adoption. Governments worldwide are introducing mandates to phase out gas cars, alongside incentives like tax credits, rebates and infrastructure grants. The EU plans to phase out new ICE vehicle sales by 2035, and China’s New Energy Vehicle policy aims to have EVs comprise 40 percent of all car sales by 2030, setting the pace for global EV adoption. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act provides up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for eligible EVs, while states and cities add further benefits. At the city level, these policies can directly translate into cleaner bus routes, low-emission zones and incentives for residents to make the switch—shaping healthier, quieter neighborhoods in the process. Major hubs like New York and Los Angeles are electrifying bus fleets, enforcing low-emission zones and providing grants to small businesses that switch to electric delivery vans.

While battery supply chains, recycling and infrastructure equity remain ongoing challenges, the cumulative data support EVs as a cornerstone of sustainable urban transportation. The shift toward electric mobility is not only reshaping the automotive industry—it is redefining how cities combat pollution, adapt to climate change and build long-term resilience.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/resource-database-zX_vbw4Z_IY-unsplash.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-05-29 14:09:44.996650

In a unanimous ruling, the supreme court justices overturned a lower court’s decision that had halted the fossil fuel project on the grounds that an environmental impact assessment by a federal agency had been too limited in scope.

Thursday’s ruling upends five decades of legal precedent by limiting the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) – the country’s landmark environmental legislation passed by Congress and signed by Richard Nixon in 1970.

“This ruling hands fossil fuel developers a hall pass to continue to destroy our climate. The supreme court’s decision endangers local communities, many of them Indigenous and rural, in favor of the dirty energy status quo. It weakens communities’ ability to stop harmful developments, ignores the cumulative harm of polluting projects, and gives federal agencies even more power to rubber-stamp infrastructure that threatens our water, air and climate,” said Ashfaq Khalfan, Oxfam America’s director of climate justice.

“After the hottest year on record, when the US should be improving environmental safeguards and empowering frontline communities, this decision is a giant step backwards.”

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-km) expansion in north-eastern Utah that would connect oil and gas producers to the broader rail network and allow them to access larger markets.

The proposed railway would transport up to 350,000 barrels of waxy crude oil a day from the sparsely populated Uinta Basin through the Colorado Rockies to refineries on the Gulf coast. If completed, the railway would more than quadruple oil production in the Uinta Basin, by linking the oilfields to national rail networks and a handful of refineries in Texas and Louisiana.

The project is backed by coalition of seven Utah counties and an infrastructure investment group, but Thursday’s ruling will be seen as a major victory for the fossil fuel industry more broadly, which has for decades lobbied against Nepa.

“Our bedrock environmental laws, like Nepa, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters. Regrettably, the supreme court has scored one for the oil companies who don’t want you to look too closely at the harm their product will do to Black and brown communities in Cancer Alley … Today’s decision will undoubtedly help the fossil fuel industry,” said Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff.

The case tested the scope of environmental impact studies that federal agencies must conduct under a US law called the National Environmental Policy Act, enacted in 1970 to prevent environmental harms that might result from major projects. The law mandates that agencies examine the “reasonably foreseeable” effects of a project.

The supreme court heard arguments on 10 December in the case, which has been closely watched by companies and environmental groups for how the ruling might affect a wider range of infrastructure and energy projects.

Environmental reviews that are too broad in scope can add years to the regulatory timeline, risking a project’s viability and future infrastructure development, according to companies and business trade groups.

The Surface Transportation Board, which has regulatory authority over new railroad lines, issued an environmental impact statement and approved the railway proposal in 2021.

The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups sued over approval, as did Colorado’s Eagle county, which noted that the project would increase train traffic in its region and double traffic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit ruled in favor of the challengers in 2023, concluding that the environmental review inadequately analyzed the effects of increased oil production in the basin as well as downstream, where the oil would be refined.

Democratic former president Joe Biden’s administration had backed the railway coalition in the case, as did the state of Utah.

Fifteen other states supported the challengers. Colorado said its economy relies on outdoor recreation, and that the project raises the risk of leaks, spills or rail car accidents near the Colorado River’s headwaters.

Despite overwhelming public support for the IRA and calls from some Republicans to preserve its clean energy tax credits, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a new budget reconciliation bill that would repeal major components of the IRA. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” would claw back more than $142 billion in direct funding to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and protect communities against the impacts of climate change, as well as tax credits for clean energy manufacturing and adoption by households and businesses.

The group, led by the SOC Investment Group and representing about 7.9 million shares, sent a letter Wednesday to board chair Robyn Denholm requesting immediate action. While their stake is a small fraction of Tesla’s 3.22 billion outstanding shares, the request signals growing frustration among investors as the company confronts weakening demand and increased scrutiny.

Tesla reported a 71% drop in quarterly profits and a 13% year-over-year decline in vehicle sales during its most recent earnings call. Shareholders argue Musk’s divided attention — including involvement with federal government projects and other personal ventures — has contributed to Tesla’s recent struggles and reputational damage.

The letter also urges the board to implement a formal CEO succession plan, limit directors’ outside business commitments and add at least one truly independent board member with no ties to existing members. Tesla’s board has faced past criticism for its close relationship with Musk, including from a Delaware judge who in late 2024 struck down the CEO’s $56 billion compensation package, citing weak oversight and board conflicts of interest.

Tesla stock has dropped about 24% since its December 2024 high, though it has recently rebounded following reports that Musk plans to shift his focus back to Tesla and away from Washington politics.

Meanwhile, the company continues to face operational challenges. A redesigned Model Y has failed to boost sales, and the long-promised Full Self-Driving technology remains in limited pilot testing. Tesla plans to launch a small-scale robotaxi program in Austin on June 12, but industry analysts remain skeptical about its near-term impact.

External risks are also mounting, including potential repeals of electric vehicle tax credits and new tariffs on imported parts. Investors warn that without stronger leadership and focus, Tesla may struggle to maintain its position in the increasingly competitive EV market.

“I think that this is going to block Colorado from implementing our Clean Car and Truck Rules for now.

Congress overturned an EPA waiver granted to California to allow that industry-dominating state to ban fossil fuel vehicle sales by 2035, a move that Colorado officials say also negates copycat EV mandates passed by Colorado and a dozen-odd other states.

In 2023, Colorado air regulators voted to require 82% of new vehicles be EVs by 2032, and an increasing share of heavy trucks as well, going well beyond floors set by the EPA. They also required a study of how Colorado could match California’s fossil fuel car ban by 2035.

“If it holds up in court, EPA may not be able to issue a similar waiver again in the future. Who knows what that means — it’s totally untested law,” he said.
