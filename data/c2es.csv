A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago, it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation.

In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.

Fast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.

Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time.

If the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections?

How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines.

When forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)

Put another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today’s trend lines suggest we’ll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.

There are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we’re at an inflection point.

In Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030.

How the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries.

In the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.

For many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1328659820.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-11-23 09:58:51.411567

I wrote a handful of articles before the US EV tax credits ended pondering what would happen to used EV prices after they were gone, and asking you readers to chime in with your thoughts. We got all kinds of interesting responses. Prices could drop considerably due to the $4,000 used EV tax credit going away, or they could rise because the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs would be gone (pushing more people to the used market, increasing demand), or they could drop due to the rush to buy EVs before October and much more limited demand, or … well, there were plenty of arguments for why they could go up or down. Now it’s time to start doing some comparisons.

Well before the tax credits ended, in late February, I went and searched out some of the best deals I could find on Autotrader. There is no perfect comparison to the cars I found then, since there are at least small differences across every used car — as well as the fact that even cars that are the same model year are now 9 months older. Anyway, though, I tried to find models close to what I had found before. Let’s see how things changed. (I recommend opening the older article next to this one in order to be able to switch back and forth for more comparisons.)

Volkswagen ID.4

Starting with the Volkswagen ID.4, in February I found a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S in my area with 27,844 miles on it for just $21,495. Looking today, here are some similar vehicles I found on Autotrader:

So, this first car has about 20,000 more miles on it, but it is the same trim (Pro S) and year (2021). The cost is $5,000 lower, though.

This one is more similar to the original, as it’s also a 2021 Pro S but it is 10,000 miles closer, actually having almost 10,000 fewer miles on it than the one I found in February. In this case, the price is still lower (despite lower mileage), but just about $1,500 lower.

This option has about 10,000 miles more than the original, but it’s a Pro rather than Pro S trim. (Big difference for buyers? I don’t know, but I doubt it.) The car is almost $5,000 cheaper than the one I found in February! And it also comes with the ID.4 Protection Package.

So, any broad conclusions? Well, you can get some used car options at the moment that have an upfront price that’s several thousand dollars lower than in February. That seems notable.

Hyundai IONIQ 5

Looking at another model, here’s what I wrote in February: “There are a several Hyundai IONIQ 5 options just above $25,000, but if you want that $4,000 tax credit, there’s just one Hyundai IONIQ 5 underneath that price. That would be a 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE w/ Cargo Package … with 42,363 miles on it. But, with a price of just $19,995 before the tax credit, that’s a wicked good deal.”

So, what’s available now? Here are three options I found:

This car is the same year as the one I found earlier in 2025, is an SEL instead of an SE, and has 37,000 miles instead of 42,000, among other small differences. But it costs ~$16,000 instead of ~$20,000. That’s basically a straight $4,000 cut!

If we go up a little bit in terms of model year, from 2022 to 2023 — but, admittedly, select a car with about 80 miles less range (but also more than 20,000 fewer miles on it) — we find an option with about the same price as the February find.

And here’s a 2023 model with more range and more miles on the clock but coming in at an even $20,000.

Kia EV6

Last but not least, let’s check out some Kia EV6 options. Here’s what I wrote in February: “I found a few models under $25,000, and several with more miles just above that marker, but here’s the one I’d highlight: 26,090 miles, 2022 Kia EV6 Wind, for just $21,998. Yes, please!”

This 2022 Kia EV6 Wind has a bit more mileage on it and is red, but is otherwise very similar to the original find in February. As it turns out, the price is almost the same as well, costing just about $600 more. That breaks the trend from above of costs coming down, though.

This 2022 EV6 Wind has more miles on it but does come in considerably cheaper, about $3,000 cheaper than the February low-price find.

And here’s another model with about twice as many models as my original find but costing about $2,000 less. Again, it’s also one model year younger, but otherwise very similar.

Last but not least, this car’s price is exactly the same as the one found in February! Differences include: it’s a Light rather than a Wind (meaning 80 fewer miles of range when new), it’s white instead of grey (yay!), and it has about 12,000 fewer miles on the odometer. Hmmm.

What do you think of these used electric vehicle options compared to the February options? And what do you think is coming for this market?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Volkswagen-VW-ID4-Florida-watermark-scaled-e1759420269816.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 09:58:32.267952

The initiative, jointly led by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, seeks to expand clean-energy generation, improve electricity access for millions of households, and support sustainable economic growth across the continent.

A statement issued by the EU Delegation in Abuja on Sunday said, “The European Union led the pledging effort, with more than €15.1bn. This includes a pledge made by President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10bn, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, member states and their development finance institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.”

Von der Leyen said, “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5bn, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity — real, life-changing power for families, businesses and entire communities.

“This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe. President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent — a future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed by Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1bn) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740m).

Additionally, Italy (€2.4bn), Germany (over €2bn), the Netherlands including FMO (€250m), Portugal (€113m), Denmark (€81m), Sweden (€44m), Austria (€5m) and Ireland (€5m) made further bilateral commitments worth more than €5bn, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600m.

Beyond European contributions, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20 per cent of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway also committed approximately €53m through its contribution to the same fund for 2026–2028.

According to campaign organisers, the pledges are expected to deliver 26.8 gigawatts of renewable-energy capacity and provide clean electricity to 17.5 million households currently without reliable power.

Of the €10bn pledged by von der Leyen for Team Europe, €3.1bn had been previously announced at major events, including the EU–South Africa Summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and UN General Assembly in September 2025, and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025. The remaining €7bn was pledged at the final campaign event held in Johannesburg on 21 November.

The “Scaling up Renewables in Africa” campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro to mobilise public and private financing for the continent’s energy transition. It aligns with global COP28 objectives to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy-efficiency improvements worldwide.

Africa remains one of the regions most affected by energy deficits, with 600 million people lacking electricity access. Despite possessing 60 per cent of the world’s best solar resources, the continent attracts just 2 per cent of global energy investment, hampered by high capital costs, geographic constraints and supply-chain barriers.

Tucson Electric Power’s business is built on the investments we must make to provide safe, reliable service — investments that increasingly include clean energy resources.

Between 2025 and 2027, we’re adding 340 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation and 400 MW of four-hour battery storage. The first half of that storage system came online this summer, thanks to a $350 million investment that represents the largest cost we’re seeking to recover in our pending request for new, higher rates in late 2026.

In light of all this, it’s hard to believe anyone would say TEP refuses to invest in renewable energy. Yet chronic op-ed critics keep making that claim along with an equally implausible motive: that we won’t invest in clean energy because it’s cheaper than other alternatives.

The truth is that while renewables provide great value as part of a diverse energy mix, they require more upfront investment. Wind and solar power systems cost significantly more per MW than a new natural gas power plant, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Moreover, they only provide energy part of the time, requiring utilities to build significantly more renewable capacity and pair them with storage or other resources to produce output that’s comparable to conventional generation.

A recent example: When TEP considered the best ways to replace two units at our coal-fired Springerville Generating Station, we determined that doing so with a new 750-MW natural gas-fired unit would cost about $1.5 billion. Providing comparable output with renewables would have required a 1,225 MW solar array plus 1,255 MW of four-hour battery storage at an eye-watering cost of $4.5 billion.

We ended up choosing a third option — converting the coal-fired units to run on natural gas — with much lower capital costs: about $200 million. In addition to promoting affordability, this option preserves local jobs and will help us maintain top-tier reliability.

Real-world energy needs typically aren’t considered in levelized cost comparisons that show renewables are cheaper than conventional alternatives. We don’t need to buy fuel for solar arrays and wind farms, helping to make their output affordable — but only when it’s available. That’s why TEP is working to integrate them with other, more reliable options that let us leverage their value.

The truth is that TEP needs a balanced energy mix to serve customers’ diverse energy needs. In more than 130 years of service, we’ve learned that clean and conventional energy resources work better together as part of an “all of the above” approach. It’s the best way to preserve reliable, affordable service as we work toward our environmental goals, including net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs acknowledged TEP’s clean energy leadership earlier this month at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for our new battery storage system, named Roadrunner Reserve. “Tucson Electric Power has been an outstanding partner in making sure that Arizonans have the power that they need,” the governor said, “and the Roadrunner Reserve system is a prime example of their leadership and commitment to our shared future.”

We know these facts don’t sit comfortably with some folks who think “corporate utility” sounds like an insult. Critics on this page prefer a cartoonish vision of utilities represented by Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons,” the boss of a nuclear power plant who once hatched a scheme to block the sun. In reality, though, TEP is working to make the most of Southern Arizona’s abundant solar resource as part of a balanced energy mix that provides affordability and reliability for our customers.

The oil industry, free market folks they are, oppose such choice. Like the horse and buggy industry being outraged by the advent of the automobile, the oil industry remains adamant that there are actually 11 commandments, with the 11th being they should have sole control of what goes in our vehicles.

The American Fuel and Chemical Manufacturers has been consistent in its disdain for ethanol. It’s used hundreds of lobbyists and billions in profits to thwart ethanol at every turn, most recently getting 27 members of the U.S. House to write a letter to leadership citing concerns that ethanol could “disadvantage the U.S. refining sector.”

That comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute reneging its support for 15% ethanol blend and setting conditions to reconsider support. Those conditions, of course, are to continue to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The oil industry continues to push the narrative that the RFS is only about energy security and how we produce so much oil that the standards are obsolete. The reality is that it is an environmental program with roots all the way back to the Clean Air Act when oxygenates like ethanol were required to get the cancer-causing, smog-forming, deadly compounds refiners use for octane out of gasoline.

Those requirements remain on the books. The single highest value of ethanol is as clean octane replacing toxic carcinogenic aromatics. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to George Bush, was a key architect of the Clean Air Act and was often asked why he supported ethanol. His answer was direct.

“Because it saves lives.”

The natural question is why we haven’t addressed this, and the answer is simple. Our leaders in the ethanol industry have failed us. Our leaders in the agricultural industries have failed us. Our leaders in Congress have failed us.

We beg with hat in hand to be “allowed” to add more than 10% ethanol, while the oil industry poisons that same gasoline with 25% or more toxics, contributing to everything from respiratory diseases to neurological ailments.

Why aren’t the ethanol and corn industries suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enact non-discretionary toxic controls? Are they afraid of the oil industry they sell to — the same oil industry that is slowly ensuring ethanol remains a bit player in the fuel mix?

Could it be a backroom deal was struck that the oil industry would give its blessing to E15 if the ethanol industry would not go after aromatics?

MORE: Rick Young: The myth of freedom in a rigged system

Spare us any talk that Donald Trump loves farmers and will support ethanol. Anyone who has ever spent five minutes in Washington understands if Trump really supported ethanol, E15 would have been in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One phone call from him and it would be done.

We are on our own if we want to save our farmers and have any hope of growing the ethanol industry. While exports have been a welcome addition to the portfolio, enforcing toxic controls with an E30 program here at home would double corn demand and bring aromatics down to minuscule levels.

Ethanol producers and corn growers need to sue the EPA to enforce the law. The South Dakota Farmers Union represents family farmers, and, even with modest resources, has waged this battle for years. We have the data, but have never had the support of national organizations with multimillion dollar budgets who could easily take on the fight.

The future of U.S. LNG dominance will depend on how effectively the industry can adapt to these shifting global dynamics.","As the United States solidifies its position as a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, the landscape of international energy trade is undergoing significant shifts. While American LNG vendors have enjoyed robust sales to Europe, recent trends suggest that this Euro-centric focus may not be sustainable in the long term. With European nations increasingly turning to renewable energy sources and reducing their dependency on fossil fuels, U.S. exporters face the dual challenge of finding new markets and competing with established players like Qatar and Australia. The coming years will test the adaptability and strategic foresight of the U.S. LNG industry as it navigates these changing dynamics.

Challenges of a Euro-Centric Strategy

Europe has been a cornerstone of the U.S. LNG export market, accounting for two-thirds of American shipments in 2025. This reliance on Europe began in earnest following the geopolitical upheaval of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted European countries to seek alternatives to Russian gas. However, this heavy focus on Europe now poses risks. As the continent accelerates its transition to renewable energy and enhances energy efficiency, its LNG demand is predicted to decline. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10% reduction in European Union gas demand by 2035.

U.S. exporters must therefore reassess their strategies to maintain growth. Current trends indicate that the European market will not provide the same level of demand in the future. The shift towards renewables is a logical step for Europe in its quest for energy independence and sustainability, but it leaves American LNG vendors at a crossroads. The question remains: can U.S. exporters find equally lucrative markets elsewhere?

Exploring New Markets Amidst Stiff Competition

As European demand wanes, U.S. LNG exporters are eyeing Asia, the world’s largest LNG importing region. However, penetrating this market is fraught with challenges. Qatar and Australia already dominate Asian LNG imports, bolstered by shorter shipping routes to key consumers like Japan, China, and India. In contrast, U.S. shipments must travel longer distances, incurring higher transit costs and longer delivery times. For example, a journey from Sabine Pass, Louisiana, to India takes more than 30 days, doubling the trip time compared to European destinations and increasing costs.

To compete, U.S. exporters must offer more attractive pricing, which could further erode profit margins. Currently, only 8% of U.S. LNG reaches the top five Asian importers, highlighting the uphill battle American vendors face. The necessity to lower prices while managing rising transit expenses poses a significant financial challenge, potentially impacting the creditworthiness of those in the industry.

Potential Trade Tensions and Geopolitical Implications

The U.S. push into Asian markets may also stir geopolitical tensions. Qatar, for instance, heavily relies on LNG exports for national revenue and has plans to expand its export volumes. Aggressive U.S. maneuvers to capture Asian market share could disrupt these plans and strain diplomatic relations. Moreover, Qatar’s commitment to invest in U.S. LNG facilities may be jeopardized if American expansion efforts threaten its market position.

Other countries like Canada, Russia, and Mozambique are also gearing up to increase their LNG exports, intensifying the competition the U.S. faces in securing new markets.

US Natural Gas Boom Sparks Economic Growth Amid Surging Export Demand, Transforming Energy Markets and Local Communities

This crowded field means that U.S. exporters are not only competing with existing players but also with emerging ones that are eager to claim their slice of the pie. The strategic choices made by U.S. LNG companies in navigating these relationships will have far-reaching consequences for the global energy trade landscape.

Economic Considerations and Future Prospects

In light of these challenges, U.S. LNG exporters must carefully evaluate their economic strategies. The financial viability of expanding into new markets hinges on balancing competitive pricing with profitability. The increased cost of shipping to distant regions and the necessity to offer competitive prices are significant hurdles. Moreover, selling to markets with less robust credit profiles than Europe adds an element of financial risk.

Despite these challenges, the potential rewards of successfully tapping into Asian markets are substantial. However, U.S. exporters must remain nimble and innovative in their approach, leveraging technological advancements and strategic partnerships to enhance competitiveness. The future of U.S. LNG dominance will depend on how effectively the industry can adapt to these shifting global dynamics. Will American LNG vendors rise to the occasion and secure their place in an increasingly competitive global market?

It's ""a major innovation,"" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said.

It's energizing news for America's EV sector from a company that already has a million places to charge in North America and Europe. ChargePoint's network has powered 17 billion electric miles, according to the California-based business.

Now, Ireland-based Eaton is helping ChargePoint add high-wattage and efficient stations that are directly connected to the grid, providing DC fast charging akin to Tesla's Supercharger network but even faster, according to the newspaper. Superchargers can provide 200 miles in about 15 minutes, for reference.

""The United States may even catch up to China's record EV charging time of five minutes for a partial recharge,"" USA Today's Charles Singh wrote.

Home charging remains the cheapest option, according to Qmerit. It's a trusted resource that can help you compare quotes for Level 2 chargers and installation.

Level 2 units can juice 25 miles an hour, which is great for overnight power-ups at home when motorists can reap lower-cost electricity rates during off-peak times, Qmerit reported.

The company added that home charging can save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year compared to gas fueling. Motorists can save money using faster public chargers, too, but the amount is less and can vanish, depending on utility rates and other factors. A standard wall outlet is the slowest method, providing about five miles an hour.

A robust network of fast options is crucial for long trips, and Wilmer said ChargePoint's upgrades will provide smaller, faster, money-saving chargers that are more efficient, according to USA Today.

Ionna is another effort by a partnership of eight automakers working to add thousands of stations across the country in coming years. Experts in India are developing a universal charger that can work with a variety of voltages, as another example of a charging innovation.

For their part, U.S. EV sales hit an all-time high of 438,000 in the third quarter as customers rushed to take advantage of $7,500 in tax breaks that expired in September, according to Cox Automotive. Cox added that sales will be more challenging without the perks, though certain states still offer lucrative incentives for buying and charging EVs.

EV owners also enjoy around $1,500 a year in fuel and maintenance savings with no more pesky oil changes. Home solar adds to the benefits by providing free sun energy to charge the rides. The Cool Down's trusted Solar Explorer has partners that can help you compare quotes, find an installer, and secure tax breaks that can save up to $10,000. Those tax credits expire Dec. 31.

That's in addition to preventing thousands of pounds of planet-warming air pollution when replacing a dirty fuel-burning ride, according to the Department of Energy. The fumes are linked by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to lung, heart, and other health risks.

As for fast public charging, USA Today reported that ChargePoint expects to start delivering the upgraded components next year.

Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald J. Trump has temporarily rolled back key federal emissions requirements on coke oven facilities, issuing a two-year exemption that the administration says is necessary to safeguard America’s steelmaking capacity, national security, and industrial resilience.

In a proclamation signed Friday, the president suspended compliance deadlines in a 2024 Environmental Protection Agency rule that imposed new hazardous-air-pollution standards on coke ovens. Metallurgical coke — a specialized fuel essential to blast furnace steelmaking — supports roughly 70 percent of all domestic steel production.

The administration argues that the EPA rule requires emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form, placing operators in an “impossible position” of attempting to engineer unproven systems on accelerated timelines. The White House said the risk of shuttered coke facilities, stalled production, and long-term damage to the steel sector justified the temporary regulatory relief.

“The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available,” Trump stated in the proclamation. “It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this exemption.”

Under the proclamation, the stationary sources identified in an accompanying annex will follow pre-2024 emissions standards for the next two years. The administration said the exemption will prevent supply chain disruptions affecting military hardware, construction materials, transportation, and critical infrastructure.

A fact sheet released by the White House emphasized that the Biden-era rule relied on monitoring and testing methods the industry cannot yet implement safely or reliably. Without relief, officials warned, the United States could face diminished steel capacity and increased reliance on foreign producers for core industrial metals.

The administration framed the move as part of a broader strategy to balance environmental protections with economic security. Trump previously issued similar delays for emissions rules affecting copper smelting, coal plants, taconite iron ore processing, and chemical manufacturers tied to defense and semiconductor production.

Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security. The proclamation notes earlier actions, including the repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a pause on wind energy expansion, and the use of Section 232 tariffs to curb foreign steel imports.

The two-year exemption takes effect immediately, delaying compliance deadlines for all requirements identified in the proclamation’s annex.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mychesco.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54921175516_9b77c7fc0e_k.jpg?fit=735%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-23 08:59:07.926656

Big plans

The Prime Minister visited the Damlaagte and Ilikwa solar power plants in the Free State province in South Africa. The facilities were developed by Mainstream Renewable Power, in which Norway’s Aker Horizons ASA is a major shareholder. Together, These two power plants will be able to supply electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of roughly 120 000 households.

South Africa is currently highly dependent on coal, which accounts for approximately 85 % of the country’s power production.

‘Norway is an energy nation, and our knowledge and expertise are making a difference far beyond our own borders. These solar power plants are an excellent example of how Norwegian investments are being used to advance the green transition across the world. Plants such as this also create new jobs,’ said the Prime Minister.

The Damlaagte project employed more than 1 700 workers during its construction and has a permanent staff of 19 to oversee operations. Mainstream Renewable Power has developed and built 850 MW of renewable energy generation assets in South Africa and is planning to establish a further 12 GW in the coming years. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 2.8 million households.

Public and private

‘This project demonstrates how private companies and the public sector can work together to achieve common goals. Norad provided NOK 20 million in grants for feasibility studies. This made it possible to identify and lower potential risks to companies, which facilitated realisation of the project. Norway can help to accelerate the energy transition by making profitable investments, and sharing its technology, knowledge and experience. This is an approach that we are proud to support,’ said the Prime Minister.

Norway is investing widely in renewable energy development in South Africa. Norway is supporting South Africa’s long-term plan to phase out coal, and helping to mitigate the country’s energy crisis and implement the green transition. Norwegian companies such as Scatec, Aker ASA (through Mainstream Renewable Power), Magnora, and Valinor/Norsk Renewables have won numerous tenders for projects in South Africa since 2010, including projects involving large solar power plants, wind farms and hybrid systems combining solar power and battery storage systems.

Norfund (the Norwegian investment fund for developing countries) has invested approximately NOK 5 billion in South Africa, predominantly in renewable energy efforts. These investments have helped to boost capacity, create new jobs and reduce emissions.

We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.","Aramex centres its sustainability work on its supply chain and fleet as it links global markets.

The company adopts a light-asset model, which means it relies on partners for many transport assets rather than owning them and this lets it adjust its network with less waste and lower emissions. It places climate action, renewable energy and fleet transition inside its market plans so each country team owns delivery.

Group Chief Sustainability Officer Manosij Ganguli leads this work across strategy and daily operations. His aim is to embed sustainability in every link of the chain so it supports competitiveness and resilience for Aramex and for customers.

He applies experience from the Energy Transitions Commission and the Mission Possible Partnership, where he shapes net zero pathways for aviation, shipping and road transport, as well as his earlier roles at BP, Shell and in strategy consulting.

Manosij focuses on scale. He states that “connecting the world” and “net zero by 2050” are goals that reinforce each other, so fleet and logistics choices must match both.

Aramex sets out action on fuel use, route efficiency, asset choice, circularity and ESG reporting to build a cleaner network. In this Q&A for World Sustainable Transport Day, he sets out how this delivery model works.

How is Aramex building on sustainability in the Middle East?

Aramex was founded in the Middle East, so the region is not just a geography for us; it is our beginning. The Middle East is emerging as an important global logistics hub, with increasing trade flows and substantial infrastructure investments.

At the same time, it is already vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme heat and water scarcity. This combination means a logistics company in this region cannot ignore sustainability and still claim to be a long-term player.

Our response has been to develop a sustainability strategy that complements our commercial strategy, rather than being subordinate to it.

In practice, this means setting clear climate targets and focusing on three key areas in the region.

First, decarbonising operations: we are investing in solar power at facilities in markets such as the UAE, Jordan and Egypt and improving energy efficiency in our hubs and offices.

Second, transforming our fleet: our strategy is to convert vehicles to low-emission models, introduce EVs and use sustainable fuels where they are available and viable.

Third, we are embedding circularity by reducing material use, shifting to degradable pouches and tightening our waste management systems. I also examine the regional signalling effect, which means that when a Middle East-based logistics company can expand, uphold service excellence and reduce emissions simultaneously, it sends a powerful message to the market.

It proves that the region can be a leader in sustainable logistics innovation, rather than merely being a consumer of global ideas. This is the role we envision for Aramex.

What is Aramex doing to decarbonise its journey?

When you examine logistics through an honest lens, the most significant environmental issue is clear: carbon.

Emissions from vehicles, facilities and the broader transport value chain are where we have the largest impact.

For a light-asset company like Aramex, this includes not only what we own, but also what we contract with airlines, sea lines and road partners. So, decarbonisation is not a “nice to have”; it is our core environmental priority.

We have worked on and created our new sustainability strategy which is grounded in real world data, which has since been blessed by our board.

Our new sustainability strategy commits to a significant reduction in carbon emission by 2030 and sets out a Net Zero Emission target for 2050. We will be focusing on reducing direct and indirect emissions, including the electrification and use of HVO in our owned fleet as well as switching to renewable energy deployment and purchasing renewable energy from the grid.

Further gains can be expected through the development and delivery of new green products.

The new strategy both reaffirms our dedication to transparency and accountability, while seeking to create value for the business, customers and shareholders.

What does circularity and green innovation look like for/in the Middle East?

In this region, circularity is not an abstract concept. You feel it when you design a warehouse cooling system for a 45-degree summer, or when you think about water use in a desert environment.

For a logistics company like Aramex, the circular question is straightforward: how do we move more parcels with less energy, fewer materials and less waste?

We started by mapping where our material and resource use is most intense. To give you an example of real world change - Aramex has accelerated its sustainability initiatives across global operations, driving measurable environmental, social and operational impact.

From renewable energy and fleet electrification to smart logistics and water management, Aramex’s projects demonstrate innovation, efficiency and commitment to the ESG strategy, circular economy and decarbonisation roadmap.

We have already generated 12,610,363 kWh of renewable energy in 2024, equivalent to 19% of electricity consumed and avoided 5190 tonnes of CO₂e.

Innovation here is also digital. As someone who has worked on sector roadmaps, I know that “green” and “smart” often go hand in hand.

We are using better data and optimisation tools to cut empty kilometres, improve load factors and plan smarter routes. These changes reduce emissions and fuel use and they also improve service reliability.

Over time, I envision the Middle East serving as a test bed for circular logistics models under real-world constraints.

If we can make these models work in hot, fast-growing cities with complex supply chains, they will be robust enough to scale. That is where Aramex can add value to the sector, not just to our own operations.

How is Aramex aligning with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals?

The UN Sustainable Development Goals help frame a simple question: are we solving problems in a narrow way, or are we contributing to broader economic and social resilience as well?

At Aramex, we use the SDGs as a reference point to balance climate, people, communities and governance. We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.

From a climate perspective, Climate Action (SDG 13) and Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) underpin our net zero 2050 ambition, our 2030 emissions reduction targets and our drive for renewables and energy efficiency.

For me, a credible logistics business in this region must demonstrate not only that it is creating jobs but also doing so in a way that protects and develops its people.

Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) guides our work on packaging, circularity and resource use. We also place strong emphasis on Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).

From a sectoral view, logistics decarbonisation and circularity cannot be delivered by a single company alone.

We engage with the UN Global Compact, regional business councils, green building councils and other platforms to share our experiences and push for clear, transparent standards. Our reporting backs the SDGs.

Aramex has a long-standing track record of sustainability and integrated reporting and we are aligning with emerging standards, including IFRS.

For me, this is about discipline. If we claim to contribute to the SDGs, we must be prepared to share our numbers, identify our gaps and outline our plans.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/66cd8d3d501f8ca9b2c9980f71ddcc3c:c5e3ea60cb1b711a7d29caeb8493dd5a/mg-image-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 08:58:56.317857

His company, X-energy, is making progress on possibly becoming the first to energize a small modular nuclear reactor in the U.S. The four planned reactors are set to power a Dow Chemical facility on the Texas coast.

Sell's company has a lot to boast about. At the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Thursday, he ticked off what he sees as groundwork for his company to become a leader in the nuclear power industry, which has seen a surge of interest in recent years as political and regulatory forces have aligned behind nuclear power.

X-energy has raised $2 billion in capital. Amazon bought a 20% stake in the company in hopes of using it to power data centers, and the company is working through the federal regulatory process -- sped up thanks to a Trump administration -- to obtain approval to build reactors at the Dow Chemical site in Seadrift.

""We have a lot of really important players that bought into our story that believe in us,"" Sell said during the panel.

In Texas, enthusiasm about nuclear energy has exploded in the past three years. It enjoys bipartisan support at the Capitol and has a major cheerleader in Gov. Greg Abbott, who helped promote what became a $350 million grant program for nuclear power research and development.

X-energy has been at the forefront of the shift in attitudes toward nuclear power, playing a role in getting Abbott's attention in 2023 on an industry that has atrophied in recent decades, said Reed Clay, a former Abbott staffer and head of the advocacy group Texas Nuclear Alliance. Now, the state is working to build a supply chain for nuclear power.

For instance, the Texas A&M University System has created a nuclear proving ground at a campus in Bryan. Abilene Christian University is designing a research reactor on its campus with some funding from the state. Both are focused on small modular reactors.

The selling point behind smaller reactors is the promise of creating an industry that relies on an assembly line that builds reactors quickly and avoids the cost overruns and delays of large, legacy nuclear power plants.

Sell lives in Dallas but leads a company with major operations in Maryland and Tennessee. He said it is a foregone conclusion that a lot of nuclear power will be built in the U.S. Many energy experts view it as a national security imperative as the U.S. competes with foreign adversaries over dominance in developing power-hungry artificial intelligence.

BUT CAN TEXAS LEAD?

""How does Texas rise to the top? Same way it always does: an incredibly business-friendly environment, an incredibly rich and well-resourced talent base, people that want to live here, an educational system that produces great talent,"" Sell said in an interview. ""It's the story that has been written about Texas for the last 25 years.""

Sell added that Texas is on track to be the leader in nuclear energy.

The worry, he said, is that competitors might trip up the momentum. Support for nuclear power has increased in recent years, but the industry is susceptible to sudden shifts in public opinion when something goes wrong.

""The failure of my competitors affects me worse than their success,"" Sell said.

""There are serious players and there are less-serious players,"" he added. ""There are folks playing it for the long haul, and there are folks playing it for the near-term game.""

Philanthropy just doesn’t give that kind of capital to Indigenous communities.
Others lean into the equally problematic idea that Native communities are just inherently resilient and capable of doing more with less.
According to the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights, “the ‘rights of nature’ is the recognition and protection of legal rights of nature, including rights of ecosystems and species.
If the answer is Indigenous communities, we must go beyond slogans and into action—action that redistributes land, wealth, power, and legal agency.","Within the first few months of the second Trump administration, as the outcome of a widely criticized Republican proposal to sell off up to 3.3 million acres of federal public lands remained undecided, a pressing question began to echo: Could Tribes or Indigenous communities purchase these public lands if they were truly put up for sale?

The question, while grounded in hope, revealed a deeper anxiety about the future of land stewardship in the United States. Since early 2025, when the Trump administration began dismantling proper management of public and federal lands by laying off or forcing out thousands of National Park Service employees, proposing $1.2 billion in cuts (a staggering 35–40% of the agency’s funding), and proposing the logging of 59% of U.S. Forest Service lands, the public discourse has reflected mounting unease. What happens when the federal government walks away from the very lands it is entrusted to protect?

The idea that Indigenous communities might take over that role is, on the surface, a promising one, borne of the belief that Tribes exercising sovereignty over more land would benefit people and planet alike. But to realize that vision in any meaningful way, Tribes need to be properly resourced—in terms of capital, infrastructure, training, and legal authority.

Seeking some clarity on what it might take for that dream to become a reality, I called Thomas Linzey, a friend and Senior Legal Counsel at the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights (CDER), to cut through the fog of wishful thinking.

Linzey didn’t mince words. “If the public lands were really being sold, the only way Tribes could protect those lands would be to buy [them]. That means raising a huge amount of money,” he told me. “Sadly, that’s not likely. Philanthropy just doesn’t give that kind of capital to Indigenous communities. It’s also unlikely that nonprofits could buy up large amounts of land either. Developers with lots of money would likely win those bids.”

Plus, he went on, “if we had the capital to do these types of purchases, we would’ve done that already, not with public lands per se, but in other large chunks of land.”

It’s a sobering assessment, but for me, it wasn’t surprising. I’ve spent years working alongside Indigenous-led groups focused on conservation, restoration, biodiversity, and regenerative land practices. The barrier of capital—of having reliable, sizable, long-term funding—comes up constantly. And buying land, monumental as that is, is only the beginning.

What we don’t discuss as much is what happens after a “land back” win. How do communities maintain stewardship, build infrastructure, and regenerate ecosystems while simultaneously supporting their people?

One place I often turn to for inspiration—and reality—is the Native Conservancy, an Indigenous-led nonprofit based in Alaska that protects both land and ocean ecosystems through Native-led trusts and regenerative mariculture. After years of activism and advocacy in the wake of the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Dune Lankard founded the Native Conservancy in 2003. He and his team have helped protect over one million acres along the Gulf of Alaska coastline in the years since.

When I asked him about misconceptions surrounding Indigenous conservation, he didn’t hold back.

“People think Indigenous-led conservation is mostly symbolic—prayers, land acknowledgments, or protecting ‘sacred’ wilderness. But the truth is, it’s about survival. It’s about sovereignty, stewardship, and feeding our people—today, not someday,” Lankard told me. “At Native Conservancy, our daily work includes harvesting kelp, delivering wild foods to elders, building community-owned seed nurseries, training youth in dive safety and ocean farming, and outfitting hybrid vessels for clean marine operations. It’s about equipping Native communities with the tools, training, and rights to protect the places we come from.”

Far too often, there’s a deeply unproductive romanticization of “land back” or Indigenous stewardship. People imagine a kind of decolonized Eden—free from modern machinery or material needs. The assumption is that because this work is Indigenous-led, it requires less: less capital, less infrastructure, fewer tools.

Others lean into the equally problematic idea that Native communities are just inherently resilient and capable of doing more with less. While it’s true that Indigenous Peoples have shown remarkable adaptability over generations of dispossession and neglect, it is unjust to use resilience as an excuse to deny them what’s truly needed: investment, infrastructure, trust-based funding, and legal authority.

If we’re serious about equity—and especially if we’re serious about repair—we need to resource Indigenous stewardship with the same urgency and scale as we fund top-down climate tech or conservation NGOs.

In the context of the U.S., the question of whether Tribes could assume management of federal lands that are currently at risk of mismanagement or sale has a tragically straightforward answer. Under the Trump administration’s current policy trajectory, the answer is no.

Co-management or co-stewardship agreements, which commit Tribes and the Federal government to collaboration and shared approaches to land management—and which can align with treaties, uphold sovereignty, and promote environmental resilience and strengthen climate adaptation—already exist. But instead of expanding these kinds of agreements, the federal government is stripping away basic supports that Indigenous communities rely on—not to mention stripping funds away from current co-management projects such as Badlands National Park and its unique relationship with the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Funding for Medicaid, the largest source of health coverage for Native Americans, is being slashed. Clean energy infrastructure projects are being halted. Tribal economic development programs, Native agriculture support, and even Tribal media funding are under attack.

“Those lands should go back to Tribal management and ownership. But you have to believe that this administration is not going to do that,” Linzey told me. “This Administration didn’t even consult the Tribes on the draft rule that was being made on the sale of the public lands, even though most of the public lands are in traditional Tribal territory…This administration is not going to do anything to help the Tribes. They’re stripping the federal government for parts, and they’re going to sell to the highest bidder.”

We’re living in an anti-democratic moment, in which short-term political gains are being financed by long-term environmental destruction. The colonial myth of Manifest Destiny still lingers, not only in ideology, but in active policy: extract, sell, profit, repeat. What makes this moment so disorienting—and painful—is that even as Indigenous leaders continue to offer solutions, their access to land, power, and capital remains minimal.

Consider what happened to the Native Conservancy earlier this year. In 2024, the organization and a Tribal partner in Southeast Alaska were awarded a significant grant from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration, tied to the historic Inflation Reduction Act. This grant would have been transformative.

But in the spring of 2025, it was terminated.

“We’re expected to lead climate solutions, but without land, without investment, and without power in the system. That’s the real barrier,” Lankard reflected. “We’ve built Native-owned kelp cooperatives, created a Guardian Ocean Monitoring program to track ocean health, launched dive and kelp farming training for rural and Native youth, and developed mariculture planning frameworks grounded in culture. But we’re doing this with short-term grants and constant uphill battles for access and recognition. We don’t lack vision or capacity—we lack long-term, trust-based investment and land and ocean access that reflects our rights and relationships.”

As I listened, I couldn’t help but think of how often I’ve heard one particular statistic quoted at climate conferences: “Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage 54% of the world’s remaining intact forests.”

It’s repeated like a mantra. But rarely does it come with the acknowledgment of what it actually takes—financially, emotionally, spiritually, logistically—to manage those forests. More often than not, this statistic is used to inspire, but not to fund. It fuels the narrative without supporting the people holding the line.

That’s beginning to shift. The nonprofit One Earth, for example, recently released their “Minding the Gaps: Climate Finance Report” and launched the One Earth Solutions Finance Tracker. Through One Earth’s tools and research, we now have clear data telling us that nature-based solutions, specifically conservation efforts that center Indigenous land tenure, are some of the most effective ways to combat climate change, but they are drastically underfunded.

When I spoke with Justin Winters, Executive Director of One Earth, she shared these alarming findings: “Our Solutions Finance Tracker project highlights the overconcentration of capital in certain ‘charismatic’ areas and a critical underfunding of essential and highly effective nature conservation efforts. Our findings show that a significant portion of the $17 trillion expected to be deployed by 2030 could be misallocated without a clear, science-based strategy that prioritizes not only the specific solutions we need to scale, but also where we most urgently need to focus our collective efforts.”

Tools like this are extremely necessary so that we can direct meaningful capital to Indigenous-led solutions, moving beyond lip service toward structural change.

But funding alone won’t solve the problem. As we look toward more permanent protections that last beyond the boom and bust cycle of federal policy, we must consider legal frameworks that recognize nature’s own rights.

According to the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights, “the ‘rights of nature’ is the recognition and protection of legal rights of nature, including rights of ecosystems and species. Rights of nature laws, policies, and court decisions recognize nature as a living entity with legal rights. Further, they institute mechanisms for people and governments to implement, enforce, and defend these rights on behalf of, and in the name of, nature.”

In 2023, CDER launched the Land that Owns Itself program, a bold legal initiative that envisions ecosystems not as property, but as self-owning, self-governing entities. The program is meant to help the law take the “next big systemic leap, such that nature is not only protected with legal rights, but is moved out from under human control and ownership, to become self-owned and self-governed,” according to the CDER program overview.

This framework resonates deeply with Indigenous worldviews, while providing enforceable legal structures that are sorely needed. After all, one of the greatest frustrations of environmental advocacy is watching hard-fought gains rolled back every election cycle. The Rights of Nature legal strategy could provide the long-term protection that our communities, and the planet, deserve.

So we return to the question: Who gets to care for the land when the state walks away? If the answer is Indigenous communities, we must go beyond slogans and into action—action that redistributes land, wealth, power, and legal agency. We must stop asking Indigenous Peoples to protect biodiversity without giving them the land or resources to do it.

And we must remember: Nature is not ours to own. It is a living system we belong to, and our task—at this late and urgent hour—is to learn how to live in right relationship again.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/landback-badlands-national-park-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 08:59:11.848137

Two weeks of climate negotiations hardly ended in triumph Saturday, following a U.N. summit whose final days included a fire that interrupted discussions about how to stop burning the planet.

But they did end, with a deal that even critical delegates said shows that a divided, leaderless collection of nearly 200 nations can make some progress toward the goal of averting heat waves, deepening droughts and increasingly destructive storms.

Dear Chancellor,

UK Autumn Budget – Scottish Government priorities

I am writing to set out Scottish Government priorities for the UK Autumn Budget. I look forward to further discussion with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury at the Finance: Interministerial Standing Committee (F:ISC) on 17 October.

Investment in public services

The UK Spending Review (UK SR) set out our expected funding over the next three years for day-to-day spending. While I welcomed the funding uplift that you announced in your Autumn Budget last year, the UK SR settlement did not build sufficiently on this increase in investment. We are set to receive a real terms increase in resource funding of on average 0.8% a year over the UK SR period. This was both below our forecast funding ahead of the UK SR and the average real terms funding uplift of 1.2% for UK government departments. As I set out in the Scottish Government’s Medium-Term Financial Strategy, this means that we face an increasingly challenging budget situation in the years ahead with demand for services and costs increasing at a much faster rate than funding.

I appreciate the financial challenges that you are facing, with reports suggesting that you need to find around £30 billion of additional headroom. This is clearly of concern to all governments across the UK, and I would not want to see constraints on our funding as you seek to address these challenges. I would urge you to consider all alternatives to spending cuts. As you are aware, we are already having to deal with the impact of the increase in employer National Insurance contributions within our budget, as the additional funding from HM Treasury fell well short of the actual cost to public services, a shortfall which we estimated at around £400 million.

It is vital that the funding outlook in the UK SR is maintained, and indeed enhanced, to support the public services on which we rely. I will be setting out the Scottish Budget and a Scottish Spending Review in early January and this will be based on the levels of funding in the UK SR, as baked into our own Medium Term Financial Strategy and Fiscal Sustainability Delivery Plan. Clearly any reduction in this level of funding would have severe consequences for public services in Scotland.

Investment in infrastructure

The UK SR also set out the future funding for infrastructure investment, which is vital to support economic growth, meet our net zero ambitions and fund maintenance across the public sector estate. However the funding we expect to receive represents a 1.1% real terms reduction to our capital block grant between 2025-26 and 2029-30. We will be publishing a renewed Infrastructure Investment Pipeline alongside the Scottish Budget and want to maximise the value of our capital investment, but face persistent high inflation and rising costs in construction, which puts our budget under further pressure.

The UK SR provided a welcomed increase in Financial Transaction funding for capital investment, however this falls far short of a fair share for Scotland (at around 3.4% of the overall UK allocation). Financial Transactions funding has played a crucial role in underpinning our Affordable Housing programme and the investments made by the Scottish National Investment Bank. It is vital that we receive a fair share of future financial transactions funding, so that Scotland does not miss out on this important funding for economic growth. We are already in discussions with HM Treasury about the role that the Scottish National Investment Bank and other Scottish bodies can play in the new funding context and I am keen that we work together to realise the contribution that these bodies can make. I am also aware that institutions such as the British Business Bank will be investing across the UK and it is important that Scotland receives its fair share.

Working together to support economic growth

As part of the UK SR I set out how the Scottish Government can work with the UK Government to support economic growth. It is imperative that this budget is targeted at realising the significant economic opportunities arising from the clean energy transition, both for the growth of the UK’s domestic supply chain, and in terms of export opportunities. Supporting local content and resilient home-grown supply chains should be a key priority.

I welcomed the announcement on support for the Acorn Carbon Capture and Storage project in the UK SR and am keen that this progresses. I also set out the key role that Scotland can play in renewable energy and on offshore wind in particular, highlighting that in order to deliver, the UK Government will need to ensure sufficiency of budget for forthcoming Contracts for Difference allocation rounds and support for Floating Offshore Wind in particular. Given AI’s potential for transformative growth, it is vital that our governments work together, to deliver on the recommendations in the AI Opportunities Action Plan. This should include the establishment of an AI Growth Zone in Scotland at the earliest opportunity.

As you take forward investment through the National Wealth Fund and GB Energy, it is important that you take account of Scotland’s unique public sector investment landscape and work with us to maximise the benefits. Scotland should secure an above-population share of total GB Energy funding, given its disproportionately large contribution to UK clean energy goals and the significant clean energy supply chain opportunities for growth. More broadly, wider funding under the Industrial Strategy, through mechanisms such as Investment Zones, and from bodies such as the OFI and Innovate UK, needs to be mobilised to attract maximum inward and private investment in our clean energy sectors and their supply chains.

There also needs to be agreement on how the apportioning of the £2.5 billion that was ring fenced for the steel sector will give proportionate support to the maintenance and development of a green steel industry in Scotland, which will be key to supporting areas such as defence, green energy transition and Net Zero targets.

The UK Modern Industrial Strategy was published in June and we are keen to ensure that there is appropriate consideration of how to deliver programmes within the Industrial Strategy in Scotland given the differences in the delivery landscape between Scotland and England. In particular there needs to be discussion and agreement on how funding to deliver the strategy in Scotland is allocated. In particular there needs to be discussion and agreement on funding to deliver the strategy in Scotland to support cross cutting themes such as innovation and our priority sectors of Advanced Manufacturing, Digital and Data Technologies and Life Sciences. In particular, we need to see support for our priority sectors of Critical Technologies, Space and Robotics Cluster. We are also keen to engage your teams on the allocation of the funds as part of the Defence Growth Deal for Scotland, which we are keen to continue to support engagement with your teams on design and implementation.

The UK SR set out the UK Government's plans for future local growth funding, successor to the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. Along with the other devolved governments, we have been clear that there must be a role for the Scottish Government is delivering this. The UK Government has announced its plans for Wales but is yet to clarify how this will be delivered in Scotland, how we will be involved in this process, and whether the role of the Scottish Parliament will be respected. As you will be aware, Scottish Ministers have been clear in their opposition to the UK Government’s use of the UK Internal Market Act to spend directly in devolved areas. I would welcome your assurance that your approach to this and other growth funding respects the devolution settlement.

The marine and agriculture sectors make a hugely important contribution to the Scottish economy and our rural communities. I have previously raised our concern that the way in which funding is now provided to Scotland does not reflect Scotland’s share of land and seas, nor the contribution that we can make to climate change and food security. I encourage you to look again at how this funding is calculated. I am also keen to see a fair share, based on previous EU funding allocations, of the UK Government’s £360 million Fishing and Coastal Growth Fund to be devolved to Scotland.

Welfare reforms and eradicating child poverty

The UK Autumn Budget will underpin the first year of action in the UK Government’s forthcoming Child Poverty Strategy, and it is critical that you are ambitious and take this opportunity to drive forward the progress that is sorely needed at a UK level. As the Scottish Government has demonstrated, through our investment in the Scottish Child Payment and other measures, it is possible to drive meaningful progress on child poverty. Through our correspondence with co-chairs of the Child Poverty Taskforce, we have set out a range of priorities which I would urge you to support.

The First Minister has made clear our commitment to eradicating child poverty and we are already taking action to effectively scrap the two-child limit in Universal Credit from next March. We have of course long-called for the UK Government to abolish this damaging policy and I am heartened to see reports that this now appears to be a prospect you are considering. I urge you to scrap the cap in full and, as the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice set out in her recent correspondence, it is vital that the UK Government provide detail on its plans at the first available opportunity.

There has been a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the UK Government’s approach to welfare reform over the past year. We welcomed the halt to changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP), as well as the reversal of your original decision on Winter Fuel Payment, which impacted on the equivalent devolved payment. I would however take this opportunity to reiterate calls to halt the planned changes to Universal Credit at least until you have undertaken a full and comprehensive assessment of the impacts the changes will have on disabled people.

It is important that the UK Government engage early with the Scottish Government on any planned policy changes emerging from the Timms Review of PIP. This is especially so where these changes will impact on the funding received through the BGA to deliver Adult Disability Payment and if they could impact on delivery of Scottish benefits, i.e. requiring devolved disability benefits to passport to reserved benefits. These interactions are complex and it is important the UK Government work with us to understand the impact on Scotland.

The Scottish Government is already spending £142 million in this year’s budget to mitigate policies put in place by the previous UK Government that contribute to poverty. In addition to continued investment in our Scottish Welfare Fund, this includes allocating over £99 million to local authorities to spend on Discretionary Housing Payments, helping to mitigate the ‘bedroom tax’, Benefit Cap and shortfalls in Local Housing Allowance rates. These policies impact on child poverty and I would urge you to consider reversing them as part of your forthcoming Child Poverty strategy. This would remove the need for the Scottish Government to provide such mitigations, enabling us to use that funding for further ambitious anti-poverty measures.

Fuel poverty continues to be a significant issue in Scotland. In 2023, an estimated 34% (around 861,000 households) of all households in Scotland were in fuel poverty. It is clear that high energy prices must be addressed, and the fundamental fiscal and policy levers to make a real difference lie with the UK Government. Progress towards heat decarbonisation also depends on wider urgent UK Government action, which includes rebalancing policy costs from electricity to gas bills to incentivise the installation of clean heating in a way that alleviates fuel poverty.

We have previously called on the UK Government to implement a social tariff in the form of a targeted bill discount, as it will address high costs at source and ensure energy bills are both more affordable and sustainable in the longer-term, reducing the likelihood of building up energy debt that will likely never be repaid. We welcome the UK Government’s Warm Home Discount scheme, but this is an interim solution and we require urgent action from UK Government that is sustainable in the long term and supports households who are struggling to pay their fuel bills. The powers to deliver a social tariff rest with the UK Government but we would urge you to consider its role in tackling poverty and would welcome further discussion.

Taxation measures

There is currently a lot of speculation about what tax changes may be included in the Autumn Budget. As you will be aware, changes you make to taxes that are devolved can have significant and direct impacts on the Scottish Government’s funding via Block Grant Adjustments, while there can also be important cross-border effects to consider in setting Scottish Government policy. Even when taxes are fully reserved, there can still be substantial implications where they interact with devolved taxes.

The limited time between the UK Budget and the Scottish Budget on 13 January means that we will have little time to consider the implications of any tax policy changes for Scotland. I would appreciate any engagement on proposals so we can understand potential impacts and to help us prepare effectively for the Scottish Budget.

We have used the limited tax powers that we have available to deliver a fair and progressive tax system which has raised significant revenue for public services. We think there is scope for the UK Government to learn from the ambitious Scottish approach and consider how it best uses the range of tax powers at its disposal.

In the run up to the UK Budget, we encourage you to listen carefully to the concerns being expressed by businesses around the impacts of the Energy Profits Levy. The UK Government needs to set out how a stable and long-term fiscal regime will be used to deliver business and investor certainty for the North Sea. The Energy Profits Levy was always supposed to be a temporary measure and we want to see the earliest possible end date, as it is now affecting investment and jobs in the North East of Scotland. The aim of the successor regime must be to give the offshore energy sector much needed certainty and treat it fairly, alongside other parts of the UK economy.

The Scottish Government has also long called for stability, clarity, and fairness in the approach to alcohol duty. The decision in the last UK Budget to raise alcohol duty whilst reducing draught duty widened the disadvantage facing Scotland’s iconic national drink. The near 14% raise in the duty levied on spirits in recent years disproportionately affects the Scotch whisky industry and we would welcome action to address this disparity in the upcoming UK Budget.

The impact of the UK Government’s changes to Agricultural Property Relief continues to be a real concern to Scotland’s agricultural community. While the Scottish Government continues to call for inheritance tax powers to be devolved, I welcome the ongoing constructive dialogue between the Scottish Government and HMRC officials to seek to mitigate the impact of these changes on heritable Scottish agricultural leases.

I am copying this letter to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt Hon James Murray MP.

Your sincerely

The media tour was led by Chief Technology Officer Shashidhar Mathapati, who guided media representatives through the 61,000 sq. metre, LEED Gold–certified campus, detailing how the facility has rapidly scaled its engineering strength. The centre currently houses 385+ R&D engineers, with plans to increase this to 750 over the next three years.

The visit opened inside the high-voltage labs, where 33 kV test systems, renewable inverters, and containerised data-centre solutions, all designed in India, undergo rigorous validation. Products are stress-tested in walking chambers simulating –40°C to 125°C, ensuring performance across extreme operating conditions. “Investing in advanced labs saves engineering hours and accelerates product development,” Mathapati said.

The tour then shifted to the automotive engineering division, backed by 100 specialists working on onboard chargers, DC-DC converters, and integrated powertrains. Thousands of automated test cases scrutinise lifecycle performance. “Automotive applications demand million-dollar precision. Our lifecycle management ensures 10-year customer support,” he added.

Delta’s market heft was unmistakable. The company commands over 63 percent share of India’s telecom-rectifier market and supplies UPS systems to global data-centre clients. The centre also develops a full stack of EV-charging solutions, from 700W portable chargers to battery-swapping stations for two- and three-wheelers.

Long-term investment continues to fuel this expansion. Of the USD 500 million pledged in 2015, 65 percent has already been deployed, with the remainder slated for completion by 2027. This pipeline is strengthening Delta’s smart-manufacturing and high-voltage product capabilities. “We’re among the few Indian players capable of designing and producing high-voltage systems at scale without relying on external platforms,” Mathapati noted.

At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.
“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit.
“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said.
Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade.","Experts warn that the Trump administration’s rollback of climate initiatives could slow the adoption of technologies and development of infrastructure that Columbus’ largest employer considers central to its future in a world moving away from fossil fuels.

Those concerns are already reverberating through the clean hydrogen sector, which experts say is feeling the strain as the administration cancels billions of dollars in grants for hydrogen hubs, winds down hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule and steers the U.S. Department of Energy back toward fossil fuels.

Cummins Inc. — the largest employer in Columbus — has spent years investing in hydrogen technologies, including electrolyzers, which are devices that use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The resulting hydrogen can be used to power energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking, maritime transport and other applications that solar and wind alone cannot easily support.

Experts say the policy shift risks ceding the electrolyzer market to China, where government investment and adoption are accelerating. Beijing has been pouring money into hydrogen production and infrastructure, positioning Chinese firms to dominate the global market of a technology the United States helped pioneer.

“What this could potentially do is just put (the United States) behind in that technology push and just leave us watching as China and others just pump out electrolyzers and basically build facilities on a backbone of non-U.S. technologies,” said Gabriel Fillipelli, professor of earth sciences at IU Indianapolis and executive director of the IU Environmental Resilience Institute.

‘Strategic review’

Signs of market instability have already emerged. Danish manufacturer Topsoe recently paused a $400 million electrolyzer project in Virginia, citing the administration’s policy changes. German electrolyzer maker Thyssenkrupp Nucera told investors it would abandon several U.S. green-hydrogen projects after incentives were scaled back.

And on Nov. 6, Cummins said it would begin a “strategic review” of its electrolyzer business after seeing “rapidly deteriorating conditions” in hydrogen markets. The company pointed to “significantly weaker prospects for demand” and reduced federal support as key factors.

“During the third quarter of 2025 … we observed rapidly deteriorating conditions in our electrolyzer markets and overall hydrogen markets, along with significant uncertainty in the alternative-power markets resulting from reductions in government incentives,” the company said.

Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey told analysts this month that the review will help the company “assess the best path forward” as the company responds to “to a very weak demand outlook.”

Despite the strategic review, Cummins said that it remains committed to “zero-emissions investments on the most promising paths to ensure we are set up for long-term success.”

Shift in momentum

The announcement of the strategic review comes after years of momentum in Cummins’ hydrogen and low-carbon ambitions — including a rebranded business segment, federal grants, White House visits, Senate testimony and even a presidential stop at one of its facilities.

Experts say that today’s landscape stands in stark contrast to just two and a half years ago, when President Joe Biden visited a Cummins facility in Minnesota and touted the company’s electrolyzer production.

“Clearly, the political change (in the United States) has been quite significant,” said Jonas Moberg, CEO of Green Hydrogen Organisation, a Switzerland-based not-for-profit that seeks to accelerate the production and use of green hydrogen across a range of sectors globally.

“There is a … challenging situation (globally) amplified in the U.S. by the political changes and the dismantling of much of the (Biden-era climate initiatives),” Moberg added.

Many of the changes in U.S. energy policy can be traced back to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Trump administration’s signature piece of legislation, experts said. The bill phases out green hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule, which experts said has prompted companies to pause or abandon projects.

Additionally, the Trump administration cut $2.2 billion in grants for regional hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest last month, as well as an additional $5.4 billion for other clean energy projects across 16 states, The Associated Press reported.

In an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place.”

For many experts, the administration’s shift in priorities was not entirely surprising.

“If you stop and think of the changes being made, part of the platform during the election cycle was, ‘Drill, baby, drill,’” said Steven Mohler, assistant professor of management at IU Columbus. “That’s one of those flags that go up and say, ‘Oh, maybe we’re going to slow down the progress on green energy and concerns with climate change.’”

Hydrogen efforts

Cummins’ turn toward clean hydrogen long predates the recent policy reversals. The company began expanding into the sector several years ago as part of a broader effort to secure its place in a global economy that is shifting away from fossil fuels and the diesel engines the company is most known for.

Clean hydrogen, often referred to as “green hydrogen,” is produced by using renewable electricity to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen atoms in wager molecules, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, most hydrogen produced today is not green but rather extracted from natural gas in a process that generates carbon dioxide emissions. But unlike fossil fuels, the only byproduct of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In recent years, several Cummins officials have said they expect green hydrogen and electrolyzers to play an important role in cutting emissions in some of the industries that are most dependent on fossil fuels, including being a “key piece in the decarbonization of transportation and industry.”

In 2019, Cummins acquired Hydrogenics Corp., adding what the company describes as key electrolyzer and fuel-cell technologies to its portfolio. At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.

Then-Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger said during the event that the company already had more than 500 electrolyzer installations across five continents and projected that the business would generate roughly $400 million in revenue by 2025.

“All in all, hydrogen technologies, particularly electrolyzers, will be a fast growing and increasingly important part of our business over the next few years,” Linebarger said during the event.

Cummins executives also made the case for green hydrogen in the nation’s capital. In March 2021, then-Cummins Vice Chairman Tony Satterthwaite urged the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to help accelerate the development and adoption of green hydrogen.

“Infrastructure is a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem,” Satterthwaite told The Republic on March 17, 2021, following his Senate testimony. “…Without infrastructure, you don’t get adoption, and without adoption, nobody invests in infrastructure. And so, we see a definite role for the federal government to kick start that chicken-and-egg cycle and provide some incentives for early investment in infrastructure.”

Waves of incentives

Later that year, Congress would enact the first of two pieces of legislation that provided billions of dollars in incentives for green hydrogen production and technologies.

In November 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which steered $9.5 billion toward green hydrogen, including $1 billion for electrolysis technologies such as electrolyzers, $500 million for clean hydrogen manufacturing and $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs to accelerate the development of a hydrogen supply chain.

Rumsey, who was Cummins president and chief operating officer at the time, traveled to the White House to attend the signing ceremony for the bill. Following the ceremony, she told The Republic, “There was a piece of this infrastructure bill that was focused on starting to build out an infrastructure that we think is key for decarbonization and our country. It includes substantial investment in hydrogen infrastructure and charging infrastructure and also recognition of the importance of low-carbon fuels.”

In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided additional policies and incentives for green hydrogen, including a hydrogen production tax credit of as much as $3 per kilogram produced.

Shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced that it would be dedicating 89,000-square-feet of its Minnesota facility to start producing electrolyzers in the United States in what the company described at the time as a “milestone.”

In March 2023, Cummins rebranded its new power business as Accelera to emphasize its portfolio of zero emissions technologies, including electrolyzers.

Following the announcement of the rebrand, Srikanth Padmanabhan, former president of Cummins’ engine business, told The Republic that “this (new brand) provides an opportunity for us to move into areas like electrolyzers that others don’t recognize Cummins as a player in because historically we’ve been in the transportation and mobility spaces.”

The following month, Biden visited Cummins’ Minnesota facility, speaking for around 30 minutes and touting the company’s efforts to ramp up its hydrogen production business in the United States.

“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit. “…But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, with the tax credits for renewable energy, Cummins is going to manufacture these electrolyzers here in America for the first time.”

By December 2024, Cummins had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal grants related to electrolyzer manufacturing and testing, including around $18 million for a project funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, according to federal records. Around the same time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced that Cummins had also received a $10.5 million tax-credit allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act for investing in electrolyzer manufacturing and testing.

But over the past several months, the Trump administration and Congress have undone much of the climate initiatives in the two bills.

Congressional votes

While Columbus’ largest employer strongly supported the hydrogen provisions in the two Biden-era bills, the city’s congressional delegation opposed the legislation.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., and then-Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, while then-Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., voted against it twice, according to congressional records.

Braun, who is now Indiana governor, said in a tweet on X on Aug. 10, 2021, “Through borrowing from our kids and grandkids we’re going to take this country to a level of debt and deficits we’ve never been to before, and Republicans are complicit in it for going along with this infrastructure bill that’s part of it.”

The delegation also opposed the Inflation Reduction Act. Young and Braun voted against the bill, while Pence voted against an initial version of the bill but did not cast a vote on the final version, according to congressional records.

At the same, Columbus’ congressional delegation unanimously supported Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” according to congressional records.

Young and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., voted in favor the bill, as did Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-Ind., and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. Both Shreve and Houchin said following the vote that the bill “unleashes American energy consumption.”

At least for now, the outlook for green hydrogen in the United States is “pretty negative,” experts said.

“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said. “There are so many consequences, and some of them are outside of the (Inflation Reduction Act). So, the fact that the president has been very negative on offshore wind and on solar, that also slows down the development of the production of renewable energy. And of course, you need a lot of renewable energy to run these electrolyzers. …I think the overall current situation, in particular in the U.S., is pretty negative.”

Falling behind China

While the Trump administration is pulling back from clean hydrogen, China is going in the opposite direction, experts said.

Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. The country is already home to the largest green hydrogen project in the world, as well as roughly 40% of all hydrogen refueling stations, according to a report by the World Economic Forum in January. Almost 60% of the world’s electrolyzers are made in Chinese factories, according to Bloomberg.

U.S. and China green hydrogen forecasts once tracked closely. But since the policy reversal in Washington, the gap is expected to sharply widen. S&P Global Commodity Insights now projects China will produce 33.4 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2050, almost three times its previous estimate before Trump took office in January.

By comparison, the United States was estimated to be on track to reach 9.3 million metric tons by 2050 before Trump’s reelection. SP Global Commodity Insights has since sliced that projection in half.

“We’re already well behind,” Fillipelli said. “All the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill were going to do is kind of get us slightly more caught up. We were already losing ground. And frankly, the country we’re losing ground to is China. …They’re investing so much in this. It’s shocking.”

“If you look across the board, they, where we’ve been pulling back, they’ve been leaning in,” Fillipelli added. “…Had we maintained the funding that we had set aside for this in the last administration, we very well might be able to catch up. Now, it seems less likely that we’ll be able to catch up.”

In the short run, the shake-up in federal clean-energy policy could have an impact on engineering and research efforts in Columbus — particularly when paired with the Trump administration’s recent move to raise the cost of an H-1B visa for skilled foreign workers to $100,000, experts said.

“As Cummins goes, we go — we have to say that up front,” Mohler said, referring to the local economy. “But the most impact I would see for our area would probably be in innovation (and) engineering activity. …The H-1B visa may have an impact on that as well. …With H-1B visas going up so high, and this hydrogen technology not readily accepted in the U.S., but it is in the Asia Pacific Area, you wonder if this doesn’t benefit those economies. Because Cummins (could) go ahead and hire the engineers and the scientists, let them stay where they’re at, do things remotely, and produce this technology for the growing China market.”

“Clean energy is something that will continue to move forward because climate change is becoming more and more evident,” Mohler added. “But without government support and assistance, we may consider … that progress will slow temporarily. …Who knows what the next administration will do? …The Biden administration put a lot of U.S. dollars behind it. The Trump administration is stepping back from that.”",,N,,2025-11-23 07:01:49.848490

Achieving progress in such uncertain and challenging times is never guaranteed, yet the talks in Belém have shown that the Paris Agreement is working and delivering results, including a call to triple adaptation finance by 2035, a Just Transition Mechanism to ensure the emerging green economy benefits everyone, and new dialogues on how trade can support climate-resilient economic transformation and how to integrate the protection of mountains into climate policy.

UNEP science and data reinforce the significant size of the challenge ahead, but equally reinforces proven solutions exist and a pathway remains to meet our global commitments. No one is saying this will be easy or we are on track. We must do much more, move much faster, and stretch our collective ambition even further. Countries should see their new national climate plans as a baseline to build on, not a ceiling for ambition. Keeping 1.5°C within reach requires us to accelerate the era of implementation at an unprecedented rate, so we can deliver the benefits people deserve: affordable clean energy, good jobs, clean air, and a safer, more resilient future for all. And as escalating climate impacts continue that spare no nation, we have to better finance, implement and prioritise adaptation efforts.

But COP30 also reinforced the growing global momentum, both in and outside of the negotiating halls, to transition away from fossil fuels as agreed in Dubai at COP28, halt deforestation - including the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility that now stands at US$6.7 billion - and pursue rapid, high-impact measures such as cutting methane emissions. The Action Agenda, the foundation to such an inclusive COP from the Brazil Presidency that saw unprecedented Indigenous Peoples leadership from the Amazon and across the world, reinforced momentum is coming from all sources, including businesses, cities and regions, local communities, civil society, women, people of African descent, youth, and many more.

Climate negotiations at the United Nations COP30 Conference ended this afternoon in Belem, Brazil, with a last-minute deal. The resolution calls for an increase in money going to nations affected by global warming to help them adapt. But it doesn't really address phasing out the primary driver of climate change, fossil fuels. NPR's climate correspondent Julia Simon is at the conference center in Brazil and joins us now. Hi, Julia.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: Hi, thanks for having me.

PFEIFFER: This conference lasted two weeks. I've read there were bitter negotiations up to the end. What ultimately came of it?

SIMON: It has been a tense conference. Ultimately, it did not deliver as much as many hoped. Let's start with what it did manage to do. The final agreement calls to triple the amount of financing to help nations adapt to a hotter world. That tripling of money will happen within a decade.

But a lot of the tension, Sacha, at this COP30 has been around this question - will the negotiations explicitly address phasing out fossil fuels? More than 80 countries were calling for this conference to emerge with a clear road map to move away from fossil fuels. Burning oil, gas and coal make up about 70% of the greenhouse gases driving global warming. The final agreement did not mention fossil fuels, and this is where it gets really interesting because one of the most important things to come out of this conference is actually the announcement of another conference.

PFEIFFER: And why, after finishing one lengthy conference, would they have another one?

SIMON: This is an important question. But the problem is that in recent years, there have been countries and NGOs saying, this United Nations process, these conferences, aren't enough. We need another process to really get countries to phase out fossil fuels, a complementary process. So yesterday, Irene Velez Torres, Colombia's environment minister, along with ministers from Europe, Latin America, the Pacific Islands - Torres announced that they are making a new conference next year in Santa Marta, Colombia. This conference is explicitly dedicated to discussions around phasing out fossil fuels. Here is Minister Torres.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

IRENE VELEZ TORRES: The idea of the Santa Maria Conference is to have this first space in which we are completely clear that the phasing out is necessary because it's not easy. No one is saying that it is easy. But if we don't face the problems, we cannot build the solutions.

SIMON: It is a big deal that Colombia is hosting this new conference. They are an oil, gas and coal producer. The co-host will be the Netherlands, the birthplace of Shell oil. And at this conference, you likely will not see Russia and Saudi Arabia, who have been an obstacle for this phaseout of fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: Julia, for these previous gatherings, there have often - they have often ended with commitments from countries to reduce their climate pollution. What's the assessment of how that effort is going?

SIMON: To answer that, I spoke to Alden Meyer. He's senior associate at climate change think tank E3G about this. He says, scientists say, collectively, country commitments are not nearly enough to avoid catastrophic warming. Right now, he says, countries are pursuing policies that would lead to their climate emissions falling by about 12% by 2035.

ALDEN MEYER: The science says we need five times that much. What I'm saying is, we're not even close.

SIMON: And this is why, again, many countries are looking to transition away from fossil fuels, the main driver of global warming.

PFEIFFER: I understand that the issue of trade was also a really big factor in this conference.

SIMON: Yeah, trade really took center stage. China is exporting massive amounts of solar, batteries, electric vehicles, all around the world. China has been pushing for free trade of this climate tech. So trade's becoming a climate issue, and this is actually an area where the U.S. is missing out. Climate tech is good for the climate, but it can also be good for a country's pocketbooks. China is now making more money exporting clean energy technologies than the U.S. is making exporting fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: So China was at this conference. The U.S. was absent. It did not send an official delegation for the first time. What about Brazil, the host of this meeting, a meeting in a rainforest?

SIMON: Yes, we're in the Brazilian rainforest, in the Amazon. Brazilian hosts did play a key role in getting the agreement through, as contested as it was, and the Brazilians will be continuing to lead the negotiations, the discussions, until the next COP in Turkey.

PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Julia Simon reporting for us from Brazil. Thanks, Julia.

A detailed communication addressed to senior officials in the Karnataka government and the Union Ministries of Power and New and Renewable Energy has warned that the state is entering a phase of structural power imbalance in which annual energy surplus coexists with rising peak-time shortages.

The letter, written by Shankar Sharma, a power and climate policy analyst and former power-sector professional from Sagara in the Western Ghats, draws attention to what he describes as Karnataka’s “ renewable paradox”: a projected surplus of 5,300 million units (MU) in 2027, alongside a forecast deficit of nearly 500 hours during peak demand in the same period. Citing a recent report in Down To Earth magazine, he argues that this mismatch is becoming increasingly common across states and could create significant financial and operational stress for the national power sector.

According to Sharma, the combination of daytime surplus solar generation, inflexible coal power schedules, and inadequate energy storage means that valuable renewable power is being routinely wasted or curtailed, compelling utilities to pay private generators to back down. He notes that curtailment losses in some states have reached 20–25 percent, and on certain days in October 2025, nearly 40 percent of solar output was denied grid access. The situation, he warns, is emerging as a nationwide concern, with media reports indicating that nearly 44 GW of renewable projects are unable to secure buyers in state utilities. If unaddressed, he states, this may jeopardize the country’s target of achieving 500 GW of clean energy capacity by 2030.

The communication attributes the crisis primarily to the absence of effective demand-side management and the lack of timely investments in energy storage. Sharma argues that India’s power planning continues to rely on outdated methods, leaving peak-hour deficits unmitigated and forcing coal power plants to operate below optimal plant load factors. At the same time, the transition toward large-scale renewable parks has not been matched by expansion of storage capacity. He criticises what he sees as an over-reliance on pumped storage projects (PSPs), which typically require five to eight years for completion and may involve major ecological impacts.

A major section of the letter focuses on Karnataka’s proposed 2,000 MW Sharavati pumped storage project, which is facing strong opposition due to its location in the Western Ghats. Sharma argues that the project is based on inadequate assessment, overlooks faster and less destructive alternatives such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), and fails to justify its siting within a protected biodiversity hotspot. He notes that BESS technology offers higher efficiency, shorter gestation periods of under a year, minimal land requirements, and negligible environmental impact. He contrasts this with the national government’s reported identification of nearly 200,000 MW in potential PSP sites, warning that widespread construction of such projects could seriously damage fragile river-valley ecosystems.

The letter points out that many states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have already floated tenders for stand-alone BESS in the 1,500–2,000 MW range, indicating the growing acceptance of the technology. Karnataka itself has initiated two projects of around 100–120 MW. Sharma argues that if BESS were not economically viable, such tenders would not exist, and he questions why long-gestation PSPs continue to receive priority despite better alternatives.

He also highlights the absence of a national energy policy and criticises the lack of coordinated planning across states and ministries. A draft national energy policy prepared in 2017, he notes, has yet to be finalised, resulting in fragmented strategies that fail to account for India’s changing energy landscape.

The communication proposes multiple measures to address the emerging crisis, including mandatory storage components for large renewable projects, deployment of BESS at substation level in every taluk, expansion of distributed solar—especially rooftop and farm-based systems—development of smart mini-grids in rural areas, and shifting energy-intensive industries and new sectors such as data centres and electric mobility toward self-supplied renewable energy backed by storage. He also argues that solar-powered irrigation pumps with grid export capability could transform rural energy economics by reducing subsidies and enabling farmers to earn revenue from surplus power.

In conclusion, Sharma warns that without urgent corrective action, Karnataka and India may face escalating financial losses, environmental impacts, and grid-management challenges. He calls for political will, transparent public engagement and rigorous long-term planning to prevent deeper crises. “The dangers ahead are clearly written on the wall,” he writes, urging central and state authorities to act decisively to avoid a cycle of energy surplus and scarcity that could undermine the country’s clean-energy transition and economic growth trajectory.

Vilas Shende, director, Mure Memorial Hospital By Moin Qazi* Central India has been one of the most fertile belts for several unique experiments undertaken by missionaries in the field of education and healthcare. The result is a network of several well-known schools, colleges and hospitals that have woven themselves into the social landscape of the region. They have also become a byword for quality and affordable services delivered to all sections of the society. These institutions are characterised by committed and compassionate staff driven by the selfless pursuit of improving the well-being of society. This is the reason why the region has nursed and nurtured so many eminent people who occupy high positions in varied fields across the country as well as beyond. One of the fruits of this legacy is a more than century old iconic hospital that nestles in the heart of Nagpur city.

Several of these enactments will play a pivotal role in long-term economic development, helping ensure the state is well-positioned going forward.

One crucial measure involved setting aside significant funds for the Texas State Technical College (TSTC) System for capital needs. TSTC provides training for numerous in-demand fields such as cybersecurity, welding, advanced manufacturing, automotive maintenance and repair, HVAC and other construction-related areas, and a variety of health care occupations. Many of these categories of workers are facing shortages which could constrain growth, and an expanding population and economy will only increase needs. Providing a meaningful endowment for current and future resource requirements (TSTC does not levy property taxes) is a key catalyst for growth.

Voters also approved setting aside $1 billion per year from sales tax revenue for the Texas Water Fund to invest in much needed water and wastewater infrastructure. Reliable water supplies are essential to growth in population, housing, expanding industry segments, and utilities. Strengthening water resilience helps support economic expansion, urban development, and quality of life. This amount represents only a small fraction of requirements but will undergird ongoing local and private-sector initiatives.

Funds were also allocated for the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, which is modeled after the state’s cancer research institute. Investing in medical research not only addresses major public-health challenges, but it also fosters biotech, life-sciences, and research jobs in Texas. These industries, in turn, lead to significant multiplier effects throughout the economy. This measure addresses an enormous need and supports the ongoing expansion of the life sciences sector across the state.

Several measures will work to reduce tax burdens related to property taxes, though some will necessitate State support to make up for the reductions (including the increase in the school homestead tax exemption). By freeing up additional resources, these provisions will generate additional consumer spending (although maintaining them may pose fiscal challenges down the road).

Other amendments ensure that state-level capital gains and inheritance taxes will not be implemented. Taxes on stock- or securities-trading entities and related transactions are also prohibited. These measures are highly significant for the burgeoning finance industry in Texas and for investment more broadly. The state has a highly favorable environment for investors, startups, venture capital, and asset managers, and these policies strengthen the capital markets ecosystem by structurally securing a favorable climate for capital-intensive and finance-driven enterprises.

As always, there are tradeoffs, including reducing future fiscal flexibility and unencumbered receipts. On balance, however, voters have decidedly improved long-term prospects. By increasing emerging industry competitiveness, workforce preparedness, and infrastructure resources, these policies will facilitate future prosperity. Stay safe!

According to the New York Times, the new guidelines could remove millions of acres of wetlands from Federal protection including those in the Lake Houston Area.

Those wetlands help soak up water, reducing flood risk. They also clean water and provide habitat for wildlife. And that’s a large part of what makes living in this area so attractive.

Before the EPA

Those of us old enough to remember a time before the EPA can remember the stinking, fetid, poisonous messes our rivers and lakes had become. The Cuyahoga River near where I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, had caught on fire 13 times before the EPA was formed. It was a testament to the failure of local governments to withstand industry pressures.

We had reached a tipping point. That’s why in 1970, Congress formed the EPA – to set national standards that protected the environment.

But this week, Washington moved to weaken the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, two bedrock laws of environmental protection. The moves come as part of a broader deregulatory effort.

Ironically, the announced motive for the federal government getting out of the wetlands-protection business was to return authority for that to the states. That theory proved ineffective decades ago. But almost two thirds of Americans alive today, weren’t even born in 1970.

The regulatory vacuum left by the Federal government will open up a window for wetlands exploitation before the Texas legislature meets again for two more years. Developers are already lined up waiting to develop wetlands in the Lake Houston Area. Yesterday, I posted about Scarborough, Holley and Signorelli.

You can bet this will trigger a “swamp rush” among developers who see the opportunity to buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, we’ve seen over and over again, how wetlands tend to be in areas that flood. It will only be a matter of time before they do.

And then all those homes sold to unsuspecting couples – who were promised that their homes met all government requirements – will be left holding a soggy title to a home they will have trouble selling for dimes on the dollar.

Clearly, the pendulum has swung back in the other direction already.

The Houston Chronicle recently documented 65,000 homes built in Houston-area floodplains since Hurricane Harvey. How soon people have forgotten! We are witnessing another disaster in the making – one that could be even harder to recover from next time.

But the changes aren’t a done deal yet. America still has a choice.

Speak Up, Speak Out

Fight back. Make your voice heard. Make sure you register your opinion about the threat to wetlands here. And write your Federal representatives. Make this an election issue.

The boring math of lower EV maintenance costs gets a softer sell.
It just explains why some people in polo shirts try so hard to talk you out of it.","EV maintenance costs are not the problem for you. They’re a problem for your dealer. New-car margins are thin, so the real money comes from the “fixed ops” side of the house — parts and service — where gross margins often live in the 45–55% range, far higher than new-vehicle sales. When you pay for an oil change, a coolant flush, or a brake job, you’re feeding the profit engine that keeps the doors open.

This chart compares a “typical” gas SUV and a similar electric SUV over ten years of ownership. Each bar shows where your maintenance money goes — and how much of that stack simply disappears when you go electric.

Over time, a loyal gas-car owner becomes an annuity. Every 5,000–7,500 miles, back you come. The service department gets labor hours, parts markup, and a fresh chance to “find” something else that needs attention. That repeat business is baked into dealership planning. Take away that stack of gas car maintenance visits and the model starts to wobble.

What EV Owners Actually Spend on Maintenance

Now flip the view to your side of the key fob. Real-world data from a large Consumer Reports analysis shows EV owners spend about half as much on maintenance and repairs over the life of the vehicle as gas-car owners. Fewer moving parts, no oil changes, no exhaust, no spark plugs. That’s not marketing spin; it’s what people actually paid.

AAA’s Your Driving Costs numbers back it up. In 2023, they pegged average maintenance for new EVs at about 8.12 cents per mile, the lowest of any vehicle category they track. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne lab found the same pattern: battery-electric cars run about 40% cheaper per mile to maintain than gas cars.

This chart shows how much profit a dealer makes from one owner over about eight years, split into four towers. The two blue bars are the thin profit on the new-car sale (EV and ICE), which is basically the same. The green bar is what the dealer earns from servicing an EV over time, and the tall orange bar is what they earn from servicing an ICE car. The picture makes one point very clear: your EV doesn’t hurt the dealer on the sale — it hurts them because the big orange after-sales tower shrinks.

For you, that means the maintenance list on an EV shrinks to a short, boring lineup: tires, cabin filter, brake fluid checks, general inspections. Regenerative braking stretches pad life. There’s no timing belt hanging over your head at 100,000 miles, no turbocharged sludge drama, no “fuel system service” surprise on the invoice.

Why Your Dealer Isn't Rooting for EVs

Put yourself in the dealer’s chair for a second. A gas crossover with good fuel economy, decent ride comfort, and clean handling brings you back to the store again and again. Each visit adds to dealership profits and helps hit service targets. The EV version of the same model slices that revenue stream down. Same customer, less service, less money.

That incentive shapes the story you hear. Concerns about battery replacement, resale value, and repair costs for EVs get plenty of airtime. The boring math of lower EV maintenance costs gets a softer sell. Industry explainers openly describe service as the financial backbone of the business, with fixed-ops margins far above the front-of-house sales desk.

How to Cut Through the Sales Floor Static

So treat EV advice from a showroom or service lane the way you treat finance offers: assume there’s a house edge. When you’re cross-shopping an EV and a gas car, ask for a written maintenance schedule and estimated costs for five to eight years on both.

If the EV needs fewer trips to the shop, that’s less time wasted, less money burned, and less drama. The fact that it also trims dealership profits doesn’t make it a bad choice. It just explains why some people in polo shirts try so hard to talk you out of it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/5c05aef891021974dafc692c1df7e542,N,,2025-11-23 03:57:34.089919

The deal finalized at the COP30 conference pledges more money to help countries adapt to climate change, but lacks explicit plans to transition away from the fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas that heat the planet.

The conference didn't do as much as scientists thought the world needed. It wasn't as meaningful as activists and Indigenous people demanded. Few countries got everything they wanted. And the venue even caught fire.

But that disappointment is mixed with a few wins and the hope for countries to make more progress next year.

Here's what you need to know about the outcome.

Leaders tried to nail down specifics on fighting climate change

Leaders have been working on how to fight the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and sea level rise, for a decade. To do that, every country had the homework of writing up their own national climate plans and then reconvened this month to see if it was enough.

Most didn't get a good grade and some haven't even turned it in.

Brazil, host of the climate conference known as COP30, was trying to get them to cooperate on the toughest issues like climate-related trade restrictions, funding for climate solutions, national climate-fighting plans and more transparency on measuring those plans' progress.

More than 80 countries tried to introduce a detailed guide to phase out fossil fuels over the next several decades. There were other to-do items on topics including deforestation, gender and farming.

Countries reached what critics called a weak compromise

Nations agreed to triple the amount of money promised to help the vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But they will take five more years to do it. Some vulnerable island countries said they were happy about the financial support.

But the final document didn't include a road map away from fossil fuels, angering many.

After the agreement was reached, COP President André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil would take an extra step and write their own road map. Not all countries signed up to this, but those on board will meet next year to specifically talk about the fossil fuel phase out. It would not carry the same weight as something agreed to at the conference.

Also included in the package were smaller agreements on energy grids and biofuels.

Responses ranged from happy to angry

“Given what we expected, what we came out with, we were happy,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.

But others felt discouraged. Heated exchanges took place during the conference’s final meeting as countries snipped at each other about the fossil fuel plan.

“I will be brutally honest: The COP and the U.N. system are not working for you. They have never really worked for you. And today, they are failing you at a historic scale,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a negotiator for Panama.

Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment and climate change minister said: “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle.” He added: ""This is a floor, not a ceiling.”

The real outcome of this year’s climate talks will be judged on “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Talks set against the Amazon rainforest

Participants experienced the Amazon’s extreme heat and humidity and heavy rains that flooded walkways. Organizers who chose Belem, on the edge of the rainforest, as the host city had intended for countries to experience firsthand what was at stake with climate change, and take bold action to stop it.

But afterward, critics said the deal shows how hard it is to find global cooperation on issues that affect everyone, most of all people in poverty, Indigenous people, women and children around the world.

“At the start of this COP, there was this high level of ambition. We started with a bang, but we ended with a whimper of disappointment,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Indigenous people, civil society and youth

One of the nicknames for the climate talks in Brazil was the “Indigenous peoples' COP.” Yet some in those groups said they had to fight to be heard.

Protesters from Indigenous groups twice disrupted the conference to demand a bigger seat at the table. While Indigenous people's rights weren't officially on the agenda, Taily Terena, an Indigenous woman from the Terena nation in Brazil, said so far she is happy with the text because for the first time it includes a paragraph mentioning Indigenous rights.

She supported countries speaking up on procedural issues because that’s how multilateralism works. “It’s kind of chaotic, but from our perspective, it’s kind of good that some countries have a reaction,” she said.

With the right policy direction, the shift away from coal could help expand clean energy industries and boost long-term economic resilience.
The report highlights that nuclear energy will play a key role in meeting future demand.
Czechia can achieve deeper savings by refining existing support mechanisms, including its well-regarded New Green Savings (NZÚ) home improvement programme.
Expanding the use of district heating networks could improve the efficiency of low-emissions energy sources, reduce waste, and enhance electricity grid stability.","A new report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights that Czechia has the potential to unlock major economic opportunities as it advances toward its energy and climate goals, but emphasizes that strong planning and consistent policy implementation will be essential for success. The publication, Czechia 2025, provides a comprehensive review of the country’s energy policies across all major sectors and lays out a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening energy security, ensuring affordability, and cutting emissions.

One of the central messages of the report is the need for Czechia to move quickly away from coal, which currently supplies more than one-third of the country’s electricity and half of its district heating. Although Czechia has committed to phasing out coal-fired power plants by 2033, rising carbon prices and broader economic factors could accelerate closures, making it urgent for the country to scale up alternative energy sources while managing the social and economic impacts in coal-dependent regions, supporting workforce transitions, and maintaining public support.

The report stresses that the clean energy transition also brings significant opportunities for industrial growth. Czechia already hosts a strong heat pump manufacturing base, and domestic production of electric vehicles exceeded 150,000 units in 2024. With the right policy direction, the shift away from coal could help expand clean energy industries and boost long-term economic resilience.

However, the IEA notes that clear and coordinated policies are necessary to guide this transformation. While the country has set ambitious climate and energy targets, it now needs a new long-term energy strategy that aligns plans with national goals, provides predictability for markets, and strengthens investor confidence.

In recent years, Czechia has made notable progress in strengthening energy security, reducing its dependence on Russian oil, gas, and nuclear fuel, and diversifying its supply sources. It is also developing new mechanisms to encourage investment in dispatchable power generation. Yet as electrification accelerates, and with projections that Czechia may become a net electricity importer by 2030, ensuring a secure electricity supply will become increasingly important.

The report highlights that nuclear energy will play a key role in meeting future demand. Extending the life of existing nuclear plants, moving ahead with new large reactors, and advancing plans for small modular reactors (SMRs) could allow nuclear power to remain a central pillar of Czechia’s low-carbon electricity system through the middle of the century while supporting thousands of skilled jobs.

At the same time, Czechia is steadily expanding its renewable energy capacity. Rooftop solar installations have grown rapidly, but wind and utility-scale solar projects continue to lag behind targets due to permitting challenges and local opposition. To accelerate progress, the IEA recommends that the government set binding targets for renewable energy deployment, improve auction schedules, reform regulatory frameworks to strengthen corporate power purchase agreements, and expand access to the electricity grid for new projects.

Consumer affordability remains a key policy priority, and the report indicates that greater demand-side flexibility, supported by widespread smart meter rollout, could help lower electricity prices. Electricity tariff reforms could further support the electrification of transport, heating, and industrial processes, leading to greater energy savings and reduced emissions.

The IEA also points to additional opportunities for energy efficiency. Czechia can achieve deeper savings by refining existing support mechanisms, including its well-regarded New Green Savings (NZÚ) home improvement programme. Expanding the use of district heating networks could improve the efficiency of low-emissions energy sources, reduce waste, and enhance electricity grid stability. As part of its long-standing practice, the IEA’s review provides detailed recommendations to support policy development and encourages the exchange of best practices among member countries to strengthen global progress on energy and climate goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-3.png,N,,2025-11-22 22:58:12.301421

At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.
“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit.
“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said.
Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade.","Experts warn that the Trump administration’s rollback of climate initiatives could slow the adoption of technologies and development of infrastructure that Columbus’ largest employer considers central to its future in a world moving away from fossil fuels.

Those concerns are already reverberating through the clean hydrogen sector, which experts say is feeling the strain as the administration cancels billions of dollars in grants for hydrogen hubs, winds down hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule and steers the U.S. Department of Energy back toward fossil fuels.

Cummins Inc. — the largest employer in Columbus — has spent years investing in hydrogen technologies, including electrolyzers, which are devices that use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The resulting hydrogen can be used to power energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking, maritime transport and other applications that solar and wind alone cannot easily support.

Experts say the policy shift risks ceding the electrolyzer market to China, where government investment and adoption are accelerating. Beijing has been pouring money into hydrogen production and infrastructure, positioning Chinese firms to dominate the global market of a technology the United States helped pioneer.

“What this could potentially do is just put (the United States) behind in that technology push and just leave us watching as China and others just pump out electrolyzers and basically build facilities on a backbone of non-U.S. technologies,” said Gabriel Fillipelli, professor of earth sciences at IU Indianapolis and executive director of the IU Environmental Resilience Institute.

‘Strategic review’

Signs of market instability have already emerged. Danish manufacturer Topsoe recently paused a $400 million electrolyzer project in Virginia, citing the administration’s policy changes. German electrolyzer maker Thyssenkrupp Nucera told investors it would abandon several U.S. green-hydrogen projects after incentives were scaled back.

And on Nov. 6, Cummins said it would begin a “strategic review” of its electrolyzer business after seeing “rapidly deteriorating conditions” in hydrogen markets. The company pointed to “significantly weaker prospects for demand” and reduced federal support as key factors.

“During the third quarter of 2025 … we observed rapidly deteriorating conditions in our electrolyzer markets and overall hydrogen markets, along with significant uncertainty in the alternative-power markets resulting from reductions in government incentives,” the company said.

Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey told analysts this month that the review will help the company “assess the best path forward” as the company responds to “to a very weak demand outlook.”

Despite the strategic review, Cummins said that it remains committed to “zero-emissions investments on the most promising paths to ensure we are set up for long-term success.”

Shift in momentum

The announcement of the strategic review comes after years of momentum in Cummins’ hydrogen and low-carbon ambitions — including a rebranded business segment, federal grants, White House visits, Senate testimony and even a presidential stop at one of its facilities.

Experts say that today’s landscape stands in stark contrast to just two and a half years ago, when President Joe Biden visited a Cummins facility in Minnesota and touted the company’s electrolyzer production.

“Clearly, the political change (in the United States) has been quite significant,” said Jonas Moberg, CEO of Green Hydrogen Organisation, a Switzerland-based not-for-profit that seeks to accelerate the production and use of green hydrogen across a range of sectors globally.

“There is a … challenging situation (globally) amplified in the U.S. by the political changes and the dismantling of much of the (Biden-era climate initiatives),” Moberg added.

Many of the changes in U.S. energy policy can be traced back to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Trump administration’s signature piece of legislation, experts said. The bill phases out green hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule, which experts said has prompted companies to pause or abandon projects.

Additionally, the Trump administration cut $2.2 billion in grants for regional hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest last month, as well as an additional $5.4 billion for other clean energy projects across 16 states, The Associated Press reported.

In an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place.”

For many experts, the administration’s shift in priorities was not entirely surprising.

“If you stop and think of the changes being made, part of the platform during the election cycle was, ‘Drill, baby, drill,’” said Steven Mohler, assistant professor of management at IU Columbus. “That’s one of those flags that go up and say, ‘Oh, maybe we’re going to slow down the progress on green energy and concerns with climate change.’”

Hydrogen efforts

Cummins’ turn toward clean hydrogen long predates the recent policy reversals. The company began expanding into the sector several years ago as part of a broader effort to secure its place in a global economy that is shifting away from fossil fuels and the diesel engines the company is most known for.

Clean hydrogen, often referred to as “green hydrogen,” is produced by using renewable electricity to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen atoms in wager molecules, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, most hydrogen produced today is not green but rather extracted from natural gas in a process that generates carbon dioxide emissions. But unlike fossil fuels, the only byproduct of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In recent years, several Cummins officials have said they expect green hydrogen and electrolyzers to play an important role in cutting emissions in some of the industries that are most dependent on fossil fuels, including being a “key piece in the decarbonization of transportation and industry.”

In 2019, Cummins acquired Hydrogenics Corp., adding what the company describes as key electrolyzer and fuel-cell technologies to its portfolio. At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.

Then-Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger said during the event that the company already had more than 500 electrolyzer installations across five continents and projected that the business would generate roughly $400 million in revenue by 2025.

“All in all, hydrogen technologies, particularly electrolyzers, will be a fast growing and increasingly important part of our business over the next few years,” Linebarger said during the event.

Cummins executives also made the case for green hydrogen in the nation’s capital. In March 2021, then-Cummins Vice Chairman Tony Satterthwaite urged the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to help accelerate the development and adoption of green hydrogen.

“Infrastructure is a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem,” Satterthwaite told The Republic on March 17, 2021, following his Senate testimony. “…Without infrastructure, you don’t get adoption, and without adoption, nobody invests in infrastructure. And so, we see a definite role for the federal government to kick start that chicken-and-egg cycle and provide some incentives for early investment in infrastructure.”

Waves of incentives

Later that year, Congress would enact the first of two pieces of legislation that provided billions of dollars in incentives for green hydrogen production and technologies.

In November 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which steered $9.5 billion toward green hydrogen, including $1 billion for electrolysis technologies such as electrolyzers, $500 million for clean hydrogen manufacturing and $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs to accelerate the development of a hydrogen supply chain.

Rumsey, who was Cummins president and chief operating officer at the time, traveled to the White House to attend the signing ceremony for the bill. Following the ceremony, she told The Republic, “There was a piece of this infrastructure bill that was focused on starting to build out an infrastructure that we think is key for decarbonization and our country. It includes substantial investment in hydrogen infrastructure and charging infrastructure and also recognition of the importance of low-carbon fuels.”

In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided additional policies and incentives for green hydrogen, including a hydrogen production tax credit of as much as $3 per kilogram produced.

Shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced that it would be dedicating 89,000-square-feet of its Minnesota facility to start producing electrolyzers in the United States in what the company described at the time as a “milestone.”

In March 2023, Cummins rebranded its new power business as Accelera to emphasize its portfolio of zero emissions technologies, including electrolyzers.

Following the announcement of the rebrand, Srikanth Padmanabhan, former president of Cummins’ engine business, told The Republic that “this (new brand) provides an opportunity for us to move into areas like electrolyzers that others don’t recognize Cummins as a player in because historically we’ve been in the transportation and mobility spaces.”

The following month, Biden visited Cummins’ Minnesota facility, speaking for around 30 minutes and touting the company’s efforts to ramp up its hydrogen production business in the United States.

“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit. “…But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, with the tax credits for renewable energy, Cummins is going to manufacture these electrolyzers here in America for the first time.”

By December 2024, Cummins had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal grants related to electrolyzer manufacturing and testing, including around $18 million for a project funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, according to federal records. Around the same time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced that Cummins had also received a $10.5 million tax-credit allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act for investing in electrolyzer manufacturing and testing.

But over the past several months, the Trump administration and Congress have undone much of the climate initiatives in the two bills.

Congressional votes

While Columbus’ largest employer strongly supported the hydrogen provisions in the two Biden-era bills, the city’s congressional delegation opposed the legislation.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., and then-Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, while then-Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., voted against it twice, according to congressional records.

Braun, who is now Indiana governor, said in a tweet on X on Aug. 10, 2021, “Through borrowing from our kids and grandkids we’re going to take this country to a level of debt and deficits we’ve never been to before, and Republicans are complicit in it for going along with this infrastructure bill that’s part of it.”

The delegation also opposed the Inflation Reduction Act. Young and Braun voted against the bill, while Pence voted against an initial version of the bill but did not cast a vote on the final version, according to congressional records.

At the same, Columbus’ congressional delegation unanimously supported Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” according to congressional records.

Young and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., voted in favor the bill, as did Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-Ind., and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. Both Shreve and Houchin said following the vote that the bill “unleashes American energy consumption.”

At least for now, the outlook for green hydrogen in the United States is “pretty negative,” experts said.

“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said. “There are so many consequences, and some of them are outside of the (Inflation Reduction Act). So, the fact that the president has been very negative on offshore wind and on solar, that also slows down the development of the production of renewable energy. And of course, you need a lot of renewable energy to run these electrolyzers. …I think the overall current situation, in particular in the U.S., is pretty negative.”

Falling behind China

While the Trump administration is pulling back from clean hydrogen, China is going in the opposite direction, experts said.

Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. The country is already home to the largest green hydrogen project in the world, as well as roughly 40% of all hydrogen refueling stations, according to a report by the World Economic Forum in January. Almost 60% of the world’s electrolyzers are made in Chinese factories, according to Bloomberg.

U.S. and China green hydrogen forecasts once tracked closely. But since the policy reversal in Washington, the gap is expected to sharply widen. S&P Global Commodity Insights now projects China will produce 33.4 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2050, almost three times its previous estimate before Trump took office in January.

By comparison, the United States was estimated to be on track to reach 9.3 million metric tons by 2050 before Trump’s reelection. SP Global Commodity Insights has since sliced that projection in half.

“We’re already well behind,” Fillipelli said. “All the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill were going to do is kind of get us slightly more caught up. We were already losing ground. And frankly, the country we’re losing ground to is China. …They’re investing so much in this. It’s shocking.”

“If you look across the board, they, where we’ve been pulling back, they’ve been leaning in,” Fillipelli added. “…Had we maintained the funding that we had set aside for this in the last administration, we very well might be able to catch up. Now, it seems less likely that we’ll be able to catch up.”

In the short run, the shake-up in federal clean-energy policy could have an impact on engineering and research efforts in Columbus — particularly when paired with the Trump administration’s recent move to raise the cost of an H-1B visa for skilled foreign workers to $100,000, experts said.

“As Cummins goes, we go — we have to say that up front,” Mohler said, referring to the local economy. “But the most impact I would see for our area would probably be in innovation (and) engineering activity. …The H-1B visa may have an impact on that as well. …With H-1B visas going up so high, and this hydrogen technology not readily accepted in the U.S., but it is in the Asia Pacific Area, you wonder if this doesn’t benefit those economies. Because Cummins (could) go ahead and hire the engineers and the scientists, let them stay where they’re at, do things remotely, and produce this technology for the growing China market.”

“Clean energy is something that will continue to move forward because climate change is becoming more and more evident,” Mohler added. “But without government support and assistance, we may consider … that progress will slow temporarily. …Who knows what the next administration will do? …The Biden administration put a lot of U.S. dollars behind it. The Trump administration is stepping back from that.”",,N,,2025-11-22 20:58:20.073710

In Michigan, a new battery storage project is serving as a prime example of the potential energy gains battery storage offers.

According to a press release by Michigan's newsroom, the state has opened its first utility-scale battery project, the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility. Located in Coldwater, the project is the result of a joint effort by Jupiter Power and Consumers Energy.

Battery storage facilities play a crucial role in meeting energy demands and stabilizing the grid. Wind turbines, for example, generate a surplus of clean energy on windy days. By pairing those turbines with a battery storage system, companies can optimize how that energy is used, storing it on days when extra energy isn't needed and releasing it during times when energy demands are high.

Likewise, solar panels produce more power on sunny days than on cloudy or rainy days. To prevent that extra energy from getting wasted, battery storage systems conserve that energy for times when energy supplies are low.

As a result, battery storage systems ""stabilize electricity prices and strengthen reliability for local providers,"" according to the press release, providing clean energy to the local community while decreasing energy prices.

The Tibbits Energy Storage Facility doesn't just provide 100 megawatts of power, though. It also provides ""$1.7 million in benefits to Coldwater Township"" and creates ""good-paying jobs.""

""Battery storage is the backbone of a clean, affordable and reliable energy system,"" Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Director Phil Roos noted in the press release. ""Projects like the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility are a testament to what's possible when innovation, forward-thinking policy and strong partnerships come together.""

As states continue to prioritize clean energy goals, they help improve air quality, combat rising global temperatures, and strengthen local grid resilience. The Tibbits Energy Storage Facility is a step in the right direction, helping the state achieve its goal to reach 2,500 megawatts of battery storage by 2030 under the state's 2023 clean electricity law.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2232930594.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 21:58:20.130129

A statement follows from NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) president Manish Bapna:

“Despite pressure from Washington and the fossil fuel industry, the world refused to backslide at this year’s climate talks. Though the pace of progress was slower than what the climate crisis demands, countries continued to march forward in the face of unprecedented headwinds.

“While much more work lies ahead, the climate conference concluded with most countries around the world, including almost all major emitters, setting new climate pollution reduction targets.

“Importantly, countries also set a new goal to at least triple adaptation finance by 2035 to provide critical support to the countries that are suffering the most from the climate crisis, yet have contributed to the problem the least, and have the fewest resources to address it.

“There is growing global consensus that cutting the pollution driving the climate crisis, and protecting against its impacts, is a matter of survival, of security, and of economic opportunity. Leaders around the world are increasingly recognizing that the costs of inaction—as well as the benefits of the solutions—are both simply too great to ignore.

“Progress made still falls short of what we need to meet the moment. But we saw large coalitions of countries and businesses setting the stage for future actions.

“While negotiators did not agree to roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and reverse deforestation and degradation by 2030 as many had hoped, over 85 countries supported the development of each. In a welcome surprise at the end of the conference, however, Brazil announced they will advance both roadmaps through a parallel political process. These action plans are needed to deliver on goals the global community has already set and must remain top priorities for ongoing global climate collaboration.

“While the targets set were stronger than in the past, they must be the floor not the ceiling. Promises made in Brazil must be kept at home—from pollution cuts, to scaling up climate finance.

“The good news for the climate fight is: Momentum continued to build at COP30 and does not stop when leaders go home. Ten years after the historic Paris Climate Agreement, the economics have undeniably shifted in favor of clean energy—and the world is inevitably moving in that direction. The bad news for America is: The U.S. opts out of this multi-trillion-dollar market at its own peril—and the countries that step in will bring the jobs and economic opportunity home for themselves.”

The halted project, intended for Baytown, Texas, was set to become one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants. This strategic shift underscores the complexities involved in transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources, especially when market demand doesn’t align with early expectations. The suspension not only reflects Exxon’s cautious approach but also mirrors broader industry trends impacted by economic uncertainties and fluctuating consumer interest.

Exxon Mobil’s Ambitious Hydrogen Venture

In 2022, Exxon Mobil unveiled plans for a pioneering hydrogen production facility at its Baytown, Texas complex. The project aimed to generate 1 billion cubic feet per day of “blue hydrogen,” a type of hydrogen that promises environmental benefits by producing water when burned. This initiative was part of Exxon’s broader strategy to diversify its energy portfolio beyond conventional oil and gas. The facility was expected to play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions by capturing and storing carbon dioxide produced during hydrogen production.

Despite these environmental aspirations, the project has encountered significant financial and logistical hurdles. The production of blue hydrogen involves capturing and storing carbon dioxide, a process that incurs higher costs compared to traditional hydrogen production methods. These added expenses have made potential customers hesitant to commit, leading to a lack of demand necessary to push the project forward. As a result, Exxon has invested $500 million into a venture now paused indefinitely.

Economic Factors Affecting Hydrogen Demand

The economic landscape has played a critical role in Exxon’s decision to pause the hydrogen project. CEO Darren Woods cited weak customer demand as a primary reason for the suspension. The industrial slowdown in Europe, coupled with broader economic uncertainties, has further suppressed interest in hydrogen as a viable energy alternative. Potential clients are wary of the high costs associated with hydrogen, especially when cheaper, albeit less environmentally friendly, energy sources are available.

Moreover, the global economic climate remains unpredictable, with factors such as geopolitical tensions and fluctuating energy prices influencing market dynamics. These uncertainties make long-term investments in new technologies like hydrogen riskier for both producers and potential customers. Consequently, Exxon’s cautious approach reflects a broader industry hesitation to fully commit to clean energy projects without assured profitability or demand.

Challenges in Transitioning to Clean Energy

The halt of Exxon’s hydrogen project is emblematic of the challenges traditional energy companies face in transitioning to cleaner energy sources. While there is a growing consensus on the need for sustainable alternatives, the path to achieving this transition is fraught with obstacles. One significant barrier is the economic viability of clean energy projects, which often require substantial upfront investment and face competition from established fossil fuel-based technologies.

Exxon’s experience underscores the importance of securing committed customers who are willing to sign contracts for hydrogen off-take. Without these assurances, companies are reluctant to proceed with large-scale investments. This scenario highlights the need for supportive policies and incentives that can encourage both producers and consumers to embrace cleaner energy solutions. As the world seeks ways to reduce carbon emissions, the interplay between market forces and regulatory frameworks will play a decisive role in shaping the future of energy.

The Road Ahead for Exxon’s Hydrogen Ambitions

Despite the current pause, Exxon remains optimistic about the future potential of hydrogen as an energy source. CEO Woods expressed confidence that the demand for hydrogen will eventually materialize, allowing the company to restart the project. He emphasized that the Baytown facility would be an advantaged project once market conditions improve. This belief underscores Exxon’s long-term commitment to integrating hydrogen into its energy portfolio.

However, the timing of this resurgence in demand remains uncertain. As economic conditions and technological advancements evolve, Exxon must navigate a complex landscape to align its business strategies with market realities. The company’s ability to adapt to these changes will be crucial in determining the success of its hydrogen ambitions. The question remains: can Exxon and other traditional energy firms effectively balance their existing operations with the growing imperative for sustainable energy solutions?

As Exxon Mobil navigates the complexities of transitioning to cleaner energy, the pause on its hydrogen plant raises critical questions about the future of energy production. With economic uncertainties and fluctuating market demands, the energy industry faces a pivotal moment in its evolution. How will traditional energy companies overcome these challenges and drive advancements in clean energy technology?

That's simply because investors and analysts are focused on Tesla's future potential.

The first part of the year brought a steep decline in share price as investors grappled with declining global sales, profits, and consumer backlash from Elon Musk's political antics. The next tale was of Tesla's swift and significant rebound in share price as investors looked to the future possibilities in artificial intelligence, robotics, and robotaxis. Tesla's next small speed bump has arrived, and this one comes in the form of disappointing news in a key market.

What's going on?

Just about every automaker in China is having a rough time. The market much more quickly adopted electric vehicles (EVs) and the government helped subsidize domestic automakers to bolster their technology and innovation. It worked almost too well and the result was a plethora of advanced domestic electric vehicle makers that created a brutal price war. It dealt massive blows to foreign automakers that couldn't compete on product, price, or both. To make matters worse the overall industry has a problem with production overcapacity and now Chinese automakers are rushing to export vehicles overseas, potentially bringing ultra-competitive and highly advanced EVs to the U.S. doorstep which is currently protected by steep tariffs on import vehicles.

Tesla has fared better than some competitors, but it has still felt the crunch in China. Recent data suggests more of the same: Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 in October, the lowest in three years. Sales plunged 36% compared to the prior year, and the sales number was a far cry from September's figure of 71,525 when Tesla began deliveries of the Model Y L, a longer-wheelbase and six-seat version of the Model Y. Tesla's share of China's EV market checked in at a modest 3.2% in October, down substantially from 8.7% in September and its lowest again in three years.

The silver lining, although it isn't much of one, is that Tesla's exports of China-made vehicles rose to a two-year high of 35,491 last month. Unfortunately, that silver lining only extends so far, and Tesla's struggles are widespread. In October, Tesla sales fell 23% year over year in four markets: North America, Europe, China, and South Korea, according to data tracked by Wells Fargo's Colin Langan.

The road ahead

With Tesla's sales lagging in key markets around the world, and analysts expecting a slowdown in the North American EV market after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of September, one might think Tesla's stock would be in the dumps. That's far from the case -- Tesla's valuation remains insanely lofty at a price-to-earnings of roughly 290 and its market capitalization is more than Ford Motor Company and General Motors combined 10 times over.

That's simply because investors and analysts are focused on Tesla's future potential. In fact, shareholders just approved with a 75% rate a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that's valued at up to $1 trillion. The kicker is that many of Musk's milestones are based on future businesses: He needs to sell cars but also 10 million driver assistance subscriptions, 1 million robots, and commercially operate 1 million robotaxis.

Ultimately, shareholders' vote on Musk's compensation package comes at an ideal time for investors to also revisit their investing thesis on Tesla. Tesla has the ability to innovate its way to a lucrative future based on AI, robotics, and driverless vehicles, but right now it's still mostly an automaker and that business isn't great currently. Investors would be wise to expect a few bumpy quarters from Tesla as it tries to navigate choppy waters that include an aging lineup, mounting lawsuits, consumer backlash and declining sales, struggling profits, a slow ramp in its robotaxi business, among other headwinds.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2025-11-22 19:59:21.885638

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Texas Pacific Land, you need to believe in the continued demand for Permian Basin oil and gas royalties and the steady growth of its water services business, despite industry volatility. The recent earnings miss may not materially impact these short-term drivers, but does highlight the sensitivity of future performance to fluctuations in commodity prices and operational revenues.

Among the recent announcements, the company’s Q3 2025 earnings report is most relevant here, as both revenue and earnings per share came in below analyst forecasts. This is especially important given the company’s high price-to-earnings ratio and investor expectations for ongoing robust royalty and water segment growth, making future quarterly results a key catalyst for sentiment shifts.

By contrast, investors should be aware that Texas Pacific Land’s high dependence on Permian activity could pose a risk if...

Texas Pacific Land is expected to generate $895.3 million in revenue and $610.3 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on an assumed annual revenue growth rate of 7.2% and represents a $150.1 million increase in earnings from the current level of $460.2 million.

Rep. Stephanie Bice, in a recent statement said it shows Congress “remains committed to unleashing American energy production” as well as cutting burdensome and unnecessary regulation and protecting Americans from violent crime.

“A huge piece of this is the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act, which moves the LNG export permitting process away from political appointees and places it with neutral experts at FERC.

ENDS Notes to editors: Read the UK’s new Critical Minerals Strategy: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-critical-minerals-strategy The UK currently produces 6% of the UK’s critical minerals needs domestically.
Our activities within magnets and other critical materials perfectly align with the new focus of the Critical Minerals Strategy.","New Critical Minerals Strategy sets out the ambition to produce 10% of UK’s mineral needs domestically and 20% through recycling by 2035.

At least 50,000 tonnes of lithium to be produced in the UK by 2035 – more than the weight of the Titanic.

Up to £50 million fund backs UK businesses by boosting critical minerals projects and turbocharging domestic production and processing, helping UK move ahead in the global race.

Britain’s supplies of the vital materials powering everyday essentials like smartphones and fridges are set to be shored up as the Prime Minister launches the UK’s new Critical Minerals Strategy today [22 November].

The strategy, backed by up to £50 million new funding, will aim to reduce the UK’s overreliance on foreign imports of critical minerals essential for everyday life by ramping up domestic production, protecting the UK from shortages in global shocks like natural disasters or war.

The move comes as the Government doubles down on shoring up supply chains as part of its push on national security.

China currently dominates global critical mineral production and supply chains, for example controlling 70% and 90% of rare earth mining and refining respectively, making Britain vulnerable from overreliance on a select few exporters for its supplies of materials needed to power things like electric vehicles and wind turbines.

But in the UK alone, demand for copper – used for electric plugs in our homes and the brakes in our cars – is set to almost double by 2035, while demand for lithium – vital for powering our laptops and electric cars – will increase by 1,100%.

That is why the Government is taking decisive action to ensure no more than 60% of the UK’s supply of any one critical mineral is imported from any one country by 2035.

The strategy will see the Government work with the sector to harness the UK’s world leading capability with Europe’s largest lithium deposit in Cornwall, one of the largest sources of tungsten globally, one of the largest nickel refineries in Europe in Clydach, Swansea and the only Western source of rare earth alloys used in the magnets found in wind turbines and F-35 fighter jets, amongst others.

It will help the UK meet 10% of its demand through domestic production, with 20% to come from recycling of products to recover minerals. This is the first time the UK has set out clear, tangible ambitions to grow domestic production and recycling, while reducing our reliance on third countries.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

Critical minerals are the backbone of modern life and our national security – powering everything from smartphones and fighter jets to electric vehicles and wind turbines.

For too long, Britain has been dependent on a handful of overseas suppliers, leaving our economy and national security exposed to global shocks.

That is why we are taking decisive action to change that, boosting domestic production, ramping up recycling, and backing British businesses with the investment they need to compete on the international stage and drive down the cost of living for people at home.

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said:

We need critical minerals for everything – from the phones we use to the cars we drive – and for too long we’ve been dependent on a select few sources for our supplies of them, putting our national security at risk.

Now, we’re taking the bold action needed to shore up our supply chains, ramp up domestic production and back businesses with the investment they need to create new jobs and drive growth, as part of our Plan for Change.

The new strategy also has the ambition to produce at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium in the UK in the next decade – more than the weight of the Titanic (around 46,000 tonnes).

The Government will deliver on the strategy by supporting UK businesses to grow and scale up their production with up to £50 million funding to boost critical minerals projects, as well as through our strong public finance offer, including investments via the National Wealth Fund and UK Export Finance.

In September the National Wealth Fund announced a £31 million commitment to Cornish Lithium to advance the Trelavour Lithium Project towards a construction decision and the Cross Lanes Geothermal Lithium Project to commercial drilling.

Businesses’ industrial electricity costs will also be slashed through the government’s British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS), encouraging firms to grow and drive new investment into the UK. The Government will launch a consultation on eligibility for BICS shortly.

To achieve the strategy’s bold aims the Government will also support permitting for innovative projects in domestic production and recycling through the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service, and work with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions to support the skills required in the UK to meet the Strategy’s goals.

For the first time, the new Critical Minerals Strategy is also laser-focused on growing the economy in line with the Government’s wider Plan for Growth, with critical minerals earmarked as a foundational sector to the modern Industrial Strategy.

The critical minerals sector contributes £1.79 billion to the UK economy and directly supports over 50,000 jobs, while there are currently more than 50 critical mineral projects based in the UK aimed at extracting and refining these vital materials.

Key regions including across North East England, in County Durham and Teesside, and the South West in Devon and Cornwall, have vital resources.

Jamie Airnes, CEO of Cornish Lithium, said:

We welcome the publication of the UK Government’s Critical Minerals Strategy that provides a clear strategic framework within which industrial scale UK critical minerals production can become a reality. The strategy highlights the need to accelerate domestic capability, unlock investment, and build strategic partnerships – all of which are essential to delivering lithium production at scale.

Securing a domestic supply of critical minerals, including lithium, will create high-quality jobs, deliver supply chain resilience and support key manufacturing sectors across the UK. We look forward to working closely with Government and industry partners to turn this strategy into action.

Jeff Townsend, Critical Minerals Association, said:

We welcome the Government’s renewed commitment to securing the critical minerals that underpin the UK’s Industrial Strategy and future economic resilience. This strategy marks an important and timely step forward – one that recognises that modern industries, from advanced manufacturing to defence, clean energy, and high-tech innovation, are only as strong as the minerals and materials on which they depend.

We recognise the growth and investment opportunities that this strategy will unlock, not only for Britain’s critical minerals companies but also for the hundreds of thousands of jobs and sectors that rely on them. If fully supported and delivered with intent, this strategy can secure the UK’s position as a trusted global partner and a leader in the technologies that will define the coming decades.

The Critical Minerals Association stands ready to support its implementation and help ensure its success.

Tom McCulley, CEO of Anglo American’s Crop Nutrients business, said:

Metals and minerals are fundamental to the energy transition, improving living standards, and food security. It is important for the UK to have a clear strategy, both in terms of the supply of critical metals and minerals, as well as the opportunities that the UK’s own resource endowments offer for economic growth.

With London at the centre of global mining finance, the UK has an opportunity to drive investment and growth through partnerships along the value chain and through the emergence of a modern mining industry in the UK itself.

The new strategy will commit up to £50 million to support projects across the country, including by expanding the research and innovation which goes into extracting and refining critical minerals, and helping businesses to commercialise and scale up their projects.

Government has already backed critical minerals businesses across the UK with over £165 million, and together with support from the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance and other public finance streams, this fund will drive growth in the sector across the country and help the UK move ahead in the global race to secure supplies of these minerals.

To boost resilience and national security, the Government will look at stockpiling, including through defence procurement, to shore up the UK’s critical minerals supplies for UK defence – in line with their widespread uses in advanced military hardware.

The UK is a member of the NATO Critical Mineral Stockpiling Project which is considering potential options for establishing, procuring and maintaining stockpiles of critical minerals, raw materials, components such as magnets and battery cells and recycled materials.

The Government will also continue to pursue partnerships with resource-rich and like-minded countries around the world to diversify the UK’s supply chains for critical minerals, using Britain’s world-leading credentials in academia, R&D, finance and trade to boost growth opportunities for UK businesses at home and abroad.

The new Strategy will be vital to delivering on the aims of the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy, with all the UK’s leading sectors which the Industrial Strategy backs – from advanced manufacturing to clean energies – dependent on steady supplies of critical minerals, including plane engines and semiconductors.

The benefits will also be reaped across the country, with Scotland placing critical minerals resilience at the forefront of its commitment to meet net zero and create a more circular economy, while Wales has maximised the geology and skills of its workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day.

And in Northern Ireland, pioneering research from Queens University Belfast and work from firms like Ionic Technologies is finding new ways of recycling permanent magnets, which are used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

The UK currently produces 6% of the UK’s critical minerals needs domestically.

Please see below for further reaction from industry welcoming the launch of the strategy:

Ionic Rare Earths Limited Managing Director, Tim Harrison, said:

With the release of the Critical Minerals Strategy, the Government is sending a strong message about the importance of critical minerals to the nation’s growth, prosperity and security.

We welcome the Strategy’s focus on domestic capability and the recognition of Belfast, where Ionic Technologies operates, as part of a critical minerals cluster. Our patented magnet recycling and Rare Earth Element separation technology is increasingly important in protecting UK rare earth supply chain security.

There has never been a more important time for the Government to back businesses that will have an impact on critical minerals supply chains.

Vale Base Metals, Darren Poland, General Manager of UK Operations:

As a vital part of the UK’s midstream through our Clydach Nickel Refinery in Wales, we recognise that critical minerals are the foundation of modern industry and trade.

We welcome the UK’s drive to strengthen its domestic ecosystem and its commitment to partnering with global suppliers to secure critical minerals like nickel for future growth.

Professor Allan Walton, Co-Director of the Birmingham Centre for Strategic Elements and Critical Materials (BCSECM), University of Birmingham and Director of Hypromag Ltd, said:

We are delighted to see that the new Critical Minerals Strategy focusses on midstream processing and the circular economy where the UK has significant strengths particularly in the rare earth value chain.

The University of Birmingham’s Centre for Strategic Elements and Critical Materials and Hypromag Ltd have recently commenced rare earth magnet manufacturing in the UK for the first time in over 25 years from recycled end-of-life products.

This process means it is possible to manufacture new magnets with an extremely low environmental footprint and at lower cost compared to other recycling options. Our activities within magnets and other critical materials perfectly align with the new focus of the Critical Minerals Strategy.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-22 19:00:03.067950

And environmental justice groups continue to view carbon trading as a way for companies to pay their way out of reducing carbon emissions, and the associated air pollution, at the source.
Forest carbon offsets were front and center in the October exchange that ultimately led to Garoupa’s departure.
The new rules were widely opposed by environmental justice groups, who see the program as driving too much funding to biofuels and hydrogen at the expense of transportation electrification.
That would leave CARB without a formal environmental justice advisory panel meeting during the cap-and-trade rulemaking, which the agency wants to finalize by the spring.","While Governor Gavin Newsom was touting California’s climate leadership last week in Brazil at the U.N.’s annual climate summit, a conflict was brewing back home between environmental justice leaders and the state’s lead air pollution regulator.

The fallout came this Tuesday, when a top advisor to the California Air Resources Board resigned in protest over what she described as “growing hostility” towards the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee, or the EJAC, which provides input to the agency.

Catherine Garoupa, executive director of the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and one of the two EJAC co-chairs, wrote in her resignation letter that CARB has increasingly dismissed science and shown a bias toward regulated industries “at the expense of low income communities and communities of color.”

The final straw was a tense meeting last month where CARB’s Deputy Executive Officer Rajinder Sahota likened a University of California, Berkeley, researcher’s critiques of the state’s forest carbon offset program to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the endangerment finding that allows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases.

“That was really the catalyst, but it’s been coming for a very long time,” said Garoupa, who described Sahota’s comments as a personal attack on the scientist in a letter to CARB leadership following the meeting.

CARB said they brought in the Attorney General’s Office to conduct an independent review and concluded that the agency’s standards of conduct had not been violated. They said they would continue to support the EJAC, whose members will all reach the end of their terms in March.

Garoupa’s resignation points to the long-running disagreement between in-state environmental justice groups and regulators over the fundamental impacts of carbon markets. That argument appears to be growing increasingly intractable just as the agency prepares to update and strengthen its cap-and-trade program, recently renamed cap-and-invest.

The program puts a declining cap on state carbon emissions across sectors and allows companies to buy and trade permits to emit up to the limit. Proceeds from the permit auctions, which have raised about $4 billion annually in recent years, fund climate programs from high-speed rail to wildfire prevention to affordable housing near public transit.

The revenues have made the program increasingly popular among politicians and funding recipients, but groups on both sides of efforts to confront climate change have been skeptical of it.

The oil industry fights efforts to make the program more stringent and costly, but ultimately prefers it to direct regulation. Trump called out the program this year in an executive order that aimed to block state climate policies, but his second administration has yet to make moves to stop it. And environmental justice groups continue to view carbon trading as a way for companies to pay their way out of reducing carbon emissions, and the associated air pollution, at the source.

Studies have shown that cap-and-trade has driven improvements in air quality across the state, but that the benefits are inconsistent across neighborhoods.

“We’ve always said it’s a dangerous approach to climate policies, to leave it to the whims of the market,” said Argüello. “We’ve always said we should focus more on reducing air pollution.”

In recent years, Garoupa said, the EJAC has worked with CARB to encourage more direct pollution reduction under the program in the state’s most polluted neighborhoods. But members feel their proposals to further limit the role of offsets, exclude technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air and implement facility-level caps or no-trade zones have fallen on deaf ears.

Forest carbon offsets were front and center in the October exchange that ultimately led to Garoupa’s departure.

Separate from the permits that regulated companies buy and trade to meet the state’s emissions cap, cap-and-invest also allows companies to buy state-sanctioned offset credits from sectors not regulated by the program, such as agriculture and forestry. Businesses currently can use these offsets to meet up to 4 percent of their required emission reductions, a cap that will rise to 6 percent starting in 2026.

Over 70 percent of those offsets come from projects that aim to store more carbon by changing how forests are managed.

On October 16, the EJAC had invited UC Berkeley researcher Barbara Haya to present some of the science on the offset piece of the program. Haya and other researchers have found that CARB is significantly over-crediting carbon reductions from forest projects, mainly by allowing project developers to choose exaggerated baseline emissions. Developers are allowed to base their estimates of how much carbon a project would store on assumptions that, without the offset projects, there would be very large carbon losses from project areas due to timber harvesting. However, researchers have found that these risks are often not as high as stated.

“This program has been heavily studied because it’s so important,” said Haya in an interview. “I don’t know of any studies that find that the program is not over-crediting.”

Towards the end of Haya’s presentation, Rajinder Sahota, who oversees CARB’s climate policy, provided comments to clear up what she described as a “mischaracterization” of the offset program.

“It’s important to have facts on our side as we do this work,” said Sahota. “We’re seeing the federal attacks on climate science and rollbacks on public and environmental protections, and CARB, the state of California, is spending significant resources to defend against those attacks on our programs and policies,” she said, noting CARB’s defense of the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases harm public health—the Endangerment Finding that Trump is trying to repeal.

“To date, we have been reluctant to use that same critical lens publicly on the continuing attacks against our climate programs from non-federal parties and that needs to change,” she said.

Offsets aren’t counted in the state’s own inventory of climate progress, she said. She went on to cite letters from the agency and a scientist in 2019 rebutting one of Haya’s past analyses, and characterized Haya as someone with a bias against CARB, saying that she provided unpaid support to a lawsuit environmental groups filed against the program in 2012. (The news outlet ProPublica reported in 2021 that she spoke with the plaintiff’s attorneys but was not a part of the case).

After the October meeting, a group of carbon market researchers wrote a letter of support for Haya, backing her presentation and expressing concerns about Sahota’s dismissal of the peer-reviewed literature as an “attack against [the Board’s] climate programs.” Garoupa also said that CARB’s carbon market staff have turned down numerous requests to speak at EJAC meetings, but did not provide advance notice of Sahota’s plans to attend and make comments, leaving them feeling blindsided by the deputy executive officer’s criticisms.

“It shows that they don’t respect our processes and aren’t actually engaging with us in an authentic way,” said Garoupa.

CARB said that they’re currently developing a plan to bring researchers together ahead of an upcoming review of the offset program. When it reauthorized cap-and-invest this past session, the California legislature directed CARB to produce a study by the end of next year looking at the impacts of state offset projects and potential changes. They also have to update their protocols for assessing and crediting offsets by 2029 to align them with the best available science.

“It is clear the offsets program is an area of robust academic debate and we are committed to a process that considers all perspectives,” said Buckley, the CARB spokesperson, in a statement. “This is an important issue globally and it’s essential to have open and transparent dialogue about how to translate academic findings into actionable, cost-effective policy.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California director at the Environmental Defense Fund who also sits on the state’s Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, said that “offsets play an important and appropriately limited role within the cap-and-invest program,” spreading climate finance into sectors not covered by the cap like forestry and to tribes like the Yurok who have used the money to buy back their ancestral lands. Offsets have historically been a way to make cap-and-trade compliance more affordable for companies, although she said that’s changing since a 2021 rule change requires more offsets to be located in the state, where projects are costlier.

“I think a part of the challenge here is that the forestry protocol is a decade old,” said Roedner Sutter, of the debate over offsets’ effectiveness for addressing climate change. “We have been among the many asking CARB for years to update their offset protocols, especially their forestry protocol and I am excited that SB 840 is going to make that happen and then make sure they’re updated on a regular basis.”

Haya said Sahota’s comments made her worried about the upcoming reviews. “Instead of addressing the scientific findings about the poor outcomes of their program, she attacked the scientist,” said Haya. “It makes me really concerned that CARB is not going to take the science seriously in revising their protocols.”

The dust-up comes a year after CARB approved updates to the low-carbon fuel standard, its emissions trading program for transportation fuels. The new rules were widely opposed by environmental justice groups, who see the program as driving too much funding to biofuels and hydrogen at the expense of transportation electrification. On cap-and-trade, environmental groups lobbied the legislature to remove the free allowances the program gives to the oil and gas sector when they reauthorized the program this year, and lawmakers ultimately gave CARB the authority to decide whether to do that.

Argüello said that the EJAC and CARB have a better working relationship on topics such as building decarbonization. Facing pressure from environmental justice groups, the state has also taken steps to better incorporate EJ perspectives in CARB’s processes, from establishing two environmental justice board seats in 2016 to, in 2021, changing the EJAC from a temporary body supporting the state’s 5-year climate plan updates into a standing committee.

Yet the groups remain at an impasse over carbon markets.

“On the LCFS, on cap-and-trade, we’ve had a harder time being heard and listened to,” said Argüello. “We’ve consistently had a position that has been resisted by CARB.”

In September, the agency told EJAC that October would be the group’s last formal public meeting before the new EJAC members took over next year. CARB said they plan to issue the solicitation for new members “early next year.” They told the EJAC co-chairs that new appointments would be in place by the fall of 2026, according to Garoupa’s resignation letter.

That would leave CARB without a formal environmental justice advisory panel meeting during the cap-and-trade rulemaking, which the agency wants to finalize by the spring.

Argüello said she was holding out hope for a smoother transition. She and Garoupa wrote to CARB’s new chair, Lauren Sanchez, last month, asking that the new appointments be finalized by March and the current members be allowed to keep meeting as a full committee until then.

“I’m an eternal optimist,” said Argüello. “I want to hold hope that the new board chair will continue the commitments to the environmental justice community and to the EJAC to make it a place where we can support and even push CARB, when it needs it, into that leadership position.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2187949091-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 19:00:09.178432

Set on 140 acres off New Dam Road, the project features high-efficiency solar modules mounted on modern tracking infrastructure. Once fully operational, it’s expected to generate enough electricity to offset the power needs of nearly 6,000 average households.

“This is a great day for clean energy in Maine,” said Jack Kenworthy, chief development officer at Walden Renewables, which developed and operates the facility. “The success of this project reflects the collaboration between landowners, city officials, and our development team. Sanford has been an exceptional partner.”

The Mousam River Solar Project is one of the largest solar installations in southern Maine. It spans several privately owned parcels and is expected to provide long-term commercial tax revenue for the city, while supporting the state’s broader transition to renewable energy.

“Today’s ribbon cutting at Mousam River Solar is an outstanding achievement for Sanford and for Maine,” said Dan Burgess, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources. “I congratulate the local community and Walden Renewables on completing this project, which will generate affordable, reliable power here in Maine, create jobs and economic investment in the region, and provide long-term benefits for the community.""

City leaders say the project reflects Sanford’s commitment to sustainable development and economic growth. With construction now complete, the facility is poised to begin delivering clean energy to the region.

“Projects like this don’t just generate clean energy — they generate real economic value for Sanford,” said Deputy Mayor Maura Herlihy. “…It’s exactly the kind of investment that supports sustainable growth for our community.”

Cait Grant, vice president of York County Community College, also highlighted the project’s workforce implications.

“As renewable energy projects come online across the state, the need for well-trained technicians, electricians, and project specialists will only continue to grow,” she said. “We’re proud to help build that next generation of skilled professionals.”

Sanford now ranks among the top communities in Maine for solar capacity, with approximately 90 megawatts installed — second only to Farmington. Officials say that momentum is no accident, pointing to strong local support, access to transmission infrastructure, and a clear vision for clean-energy investment.","https://www.seacoastonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/21/NPOH/87388529007-sanfordsolar.jpeg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-22 18:00:01.630986

WASHINGTON – On Nov. 20, Indiana 2nd District U.S. Rep. Rudy Yakym, a Republican, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jimmy Panetta, of California’s 19th District, saw their bipartisan bill, the “Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act” (H.R. 573), advance through the Natural Resources Committee under unanimous consent.

The legislation is intended to inform policymakers about the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) by requiring the Council on Environmental Quality to publish an annual report on NEPA projects and outcomes, with the goal of ensuring greater transparency.

“The Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act is a common-sense step to bring needed transparency to a process that has too often stalled infrastructure, housing and energy projects,” Yakym said. “By restoring these reports, and with the bipartisan work of Rep. Jimmy Panetta, we can better understand NEPA’s impact on jobs and investment and ensure recent reforms are truly working for the American people.”

“The federal permitting process for new infrastructure, housing, and energy projects can be unnecessarily long and confusing,” Panetta said. “This legislation takes a practical approach by requiring yearly assessments by the Council on Environmental Quality on the permitting process’ efficiency and effectiveness. It’s encouraging to see bipartisan interest in making it easier to advance the development of affordable housing, clean energy projects, and our nation’s infrastructure.”

“H.R. 573, the Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act, will give policymakers the critical information needed to make the permitting process more efficient and accountable, by reducing burdensome delays,” Rep. Bruce Westerman, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, said. “I applaud Rep. Yakym for leading this bipartisan effort to bring greater transparency to the permitting process, and I look forward to working with him to advance this important bill through Congress.”",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rudy-yakym-news.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 20:58:30.333860

“The Oneka solution saves 1 ton of CO₂ emissions per year for each cubic meter of fresh water produced daily, compared with diesel-powered desalination plants,” Oneka staff said.
Fort Bragg city officials hope the system will provide a reliable source of freshwater during drought years.
Before a guided tour of the buoy, Oneka CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic explained the scope of the project.
Freshwater will be piped to shore through a 3-inch line, and officials will monitor water quality and system performance,” he said.","OCEAN WAVES COULD SOON help solve Fort Bragg’s drought worries. Last week, the city and Quebec, Canada-based Oneka Technologies displayed California’s first wave-powered desalination pilot buoy.

The Noyo Harbor-based buoy, part of the ResilienSea Project, is a partnership with the city and supported by a $1.5 million grant from the state of California. The community is already benefiting from the project, with local labor, fishing boats and divers involved in support operations.

Oneka staff gave a walk-through tour of the “Iceberg-class buoy,” explaining how it converts seawater into freshwater. The unit to be deployed off Noyo Harbor is the ninth generation of wave-powered desalination systems developed over 10 years of ocean testing by Oneka. Its half-mile offshore site was carefully chosen to balance pumping efficiency, available wave energy, water depth for brine dispersion and visual impacts.

The system requires no batteries, grid connections or fossil fuels. And the results of this pilot project will determine whether a larger array of wave-powered units could eventually supplement Fort Bragg’s municipal water supply.

“The Oneka solution saves 1 ton of CO₂ emissions per year for each cubic meter of fresh water produced daily, compared with diesel-powered desalination plants,” Oneka staff said. “This means that in the pilot project, 50 tons of CO₂ emissions would be saved.”

City leaders and state officials in attendance called the project a model for climate adaptation, demonstrating how science and innovation can address water scarcity while protecting the ocean environment.

Fort Bragg city officials hope the system will provide a reliable source of freshwater during drought years.

Fort Bragg Public Works Director John Smith told the gathering, “Obviously, we are here for water. It has been a challenge for us in the 1970s. [Then] 2014 was the first wake-up call for us, pretty much we had no water in the river and only one reservoir. 2021 was also a bad year for us, extreme drought, and if you were living in town, you knew what the consequences of that were.”

The project also advances Fort Bragg’s “blue economy” initiative, promoting renewable energy, marine-tech jobs, ecosystem protection, and shoreline resilience — goals the city has prioritized.

Sarah McCormick, the city’s economic development manager, explained how the 2022 Blue Economy Symposium and Learning Festival sparked the wave-powered desalination project.

“We brought the community together to look at how we could work regionally to position our coastline for investment in emerging fields around the blue economy. Oneka found us through that effort,” McCormick said “We’re really proud that we could partner with them to try out this science. It’s not every community that’s willing to let science drive the decision-making.” She said the next year would involve monitoring and analyzing data to determine the buoy’s feasibility as a long-term solution to Fort Bragg’s water woes.

Since its founding in 2015, Oneka has deployed similar buoys in Florida, Nova Scotia and Chile to help communities address water shortages.

Before a guided tour of the buoy, Oneka CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic explained the scope of the project.

“The Iceberg-class buoy is expected to produce roughly 13,200 gallons of freshwater per day during a 12-month trial. Freshwater will be piped to shore through a 3-inch line, and officials will monitor water quality and system performance,” he said.

“The project delivers a reliable supply of fresh water using clean, zero-emission energy, protects the environment by avoiding lead and employing a low-concentration, chemical-free design safe for marine life.” He explained that 60 sensors, including cameras, monitor the buoy’s performance and environmental impact.

The system uses a 60-micron mesh to filter out incoming debris. “To put it in perspective, 60 microns — or 0.06 millimeters — is even smaller than the mesh typically used for capturing fish larvae,” he said.

“Oneka’s freshwater technology does not require obtaining land-based operations,” Tutic said. “The unit that you see today is the same as the unit that was installed in Nova Scotia last fall, and it withstood waves converging at 20 feet on average and at extremes of 30 feet.”

Tutic then turned to a clear cube-like apparatus set up near the buoy to demonstrate how the seawater was processed.“The system has three main components: one handles the seawater intake, from there, it moves through pre-filters to remove impurities, and finally passes through the membranes for purification.”

The membranes separate freshwater from the seawater. Water with excess salt, or brine, is released back into the ocean while the freshwater is collected for use.

The Mendocino Voice interviewed officials and Oneka staff about the project’s goals and expected impact on the community.

Mary Rose Kaczorowski: How is the project financed and what are the next steps?

Fort Bragg City Manager Isaac Whippy: We got [$1,490,000] from the California State Department of Water Resources to fund this project. Next spring if all the permits go well, we will start to install the buoy moorings. We’re looking at next summer for the entire system to go live and be deployed for a 12-month trial period.

We will be using that data, and part of our plan for the next five years is to see if this could supplement our current water supply. The trial period is primarily about learning, gathering data, and studying the science.

We have a lot of whale migrations and many species of fish passing through this area, and there have been strandings. How can you prevent entanglements, especially of larger marine mammals?

Oneka Technologies CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic: There are two aspects to consider regarding entanglement risks, and both are addressed as part of the permitting process. First, the design of the system itself minimizes the risk of physical entanglement: all ropes are properly secured and capped, and heavy chains are used, making first-degree entanglements extremely unlikely.

Second, for indirect risks—such as fishnets or debris getting caught—we have monitoring and mitigation processes in place to ensure that nothing in the system poses a threat to marine life. To provide some context, similar systems have been installed in Florida, Chile, and Nova Scotia, and there have been no recorded entanglements of marine animals.

Who will monitor operations? Who will facilitate rapid response to the Iceberg if needed?

Oneka Technologies Quality-Assurance Engineer Emily Veinot: “We’re now locally based so we can manage the installation, day-to-day operations and handle community relations, and work with local suppliers and laborers. If any issue comes up, once the buoy is positioned, we can quickly reach the buoy and address the situation.”

How would you describe the importance of this project?

California 2nd District Assemblymember Chris Rogers, D-Santa Rosa: This project is a great example of advancing innovative solutions to address climate change while mitigating impacts already being felt. Fort Bragg has been ground zero for drought in the past, creating challenges for both the local economy and residents. There has been a significant energy cost — and a major cost to marine life — associated with previous solutions, often pitting people against fish and against the climate. What’s different here is that this project has been designed to truly strike a balance between human needs and the needs of the ocean.

This project is exactly the kind of model we wanted to highlight here in California — another first for this coast, alongside innovative research at the Noyo Center for Marine Sciences.

Necessity is often the mother of invention, and here on the Mendocino Coast, challenges like drought and sea urchin overpopulation have spurred new businesses and ideas. Projects like this serve as a test bed for innovations that could expand along the California coast.

What brought you here to see this project in person?

California 12th District Assemblymember Damon Connolly, D-San Rafael: I represent Assembly District 12, which is southern Sonoma County and Marin County to the south of Roger’s district. A lot of the work I do in the Assembly centers on climate policy and the environment. There’s also Proposition 4, the climate bond, which is opening up an entirely new world of funding opportunities, including support for technology and breakthrough ideas that can help us confront the climate crisis. I was one of the principal authors of the climate bond that authorized $10 billion for safe drinking water, wildfire prevention, drought preparedness and clean air. That measure was approved by voters in the November 2024 election.

How do you think the California Assembly and Senate members are dealing with federal pushback?

Connolly: It’s a number of different strategies. We are pushing hard against the feds on the legal front. State Attorney General Rob Bonta; he’s now filed about 46 lawsuits as of last week. Our residents are not receiving the benefits of taxpayer money that they’re paying out to D.C., and it’s being improperly and illegally withheld, and we want to get that back for wildfire prevention, for climate, for healthcare. We are also trying to fill gaps—as federal money is withheld on these priorities, we’re looking at things like the climate bond to fill important policy gaps.

An enthusiastic reception

More than 50 people attended the event, and enthusiasm steadily grew throughout the day. The final highlight was the chance to applaud the Oneka team gathered in front of the buoy for a photo op. For some, it was their first time on the Northern California coast, and residents gave them a memorable welcome.

There was one more special touch. Once the buoy was completed, all who worked on it gathered to sign its hull with messages in French and English — from “bon voyage” to “bonne chère.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BCN-20251114-DESALINATION-01-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-22 21:58:23.613901

Having EV chargers boosts green certifications, improves ratings on sustainability-focused platforms, and attracts corporate clients with strict environmental policies.","Hotels often offer a range of built-in perks, including gym access, complimentary breakfast, and daily turn-down service. But it seems some of them haven’t entered the modern era when it comes to their parking—or in this case, charging—situation.

Despite the rise of electric vehicles, many hotels have yet to add charging stations to their parking lots. One man is saying that this is not only a missed opportunity, but just plain bad customer service.

Where Do Hotel Goers Charge Their Cars?

In a TikTok video, Anup Parikh (@pangeacharging), owner and founder of electric vehicle charging infrastructure company Pangea Charging, calls out hotels for not offering something that, at this point, he thinks should be standard.

""What do these three hotels around me have in common? None of them offer electric vehicle charging stations on site,"" he says while filming in a parking lot near several hotels.

Parikh explains that it’s F1 weekend in Austin, Texas, which means an influx of out-of-towners staying at hotels and renting cars.

""There are a bunch of people being sent out in electric vehicle rental cars from the rental agencies showing up to hotels that don't have chargers,"" Parikh notes.

Our team of experts tracks what owners are saying about car-shopping, repairs, the daily driving experience and more on social media.

Parikh spoke to three hotel owners or operators about what they do when a guest needs to charge their car since they don’t have chargers in their parking lots. It turns out they’re sending guests to a grocery store about two miles away that has electric vehicle fast-charging stations.

""Now it always makes me wonder why hotels don't send folks away to Denny's for the continental breakfast, to Planet Fitness for the gym, or a local laundromat for laundry,"" he says.

""They provide it on-site, and that's the same value hotel should be offering for loyalty, convenience, and really just to drive more revenue.""

He adds that Austin is an especially popular city for year-round events, such as Austin City Limits, and for students and parents visiting local colleges.

""So if you wanna make more money and book more room nights at your hotel to this growing population of EVs, contact Pangea Charging will help you get set up with EV chargers and make the process seamless and simple,"" he concluded, plugging his business.

In the caption, he adds the following: ""Hotels could have booked more rooms and earned more revenue if they offered this crucial amenity.""

How to Find Hotels With EV Charging

For EV drivers, finding a hotel with charging stations can make or break a road trip. NerdWallet points out that while thousands of hotels now offer EV chargers, not all booking platforms make them easy to find.

Your best bet? PlugShare is still the gold standard for locating hotel-based chargers—you can search by hotel name or location and filter for ""lodging"" under amenities.

Major booking sites, such as Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com, now offer ""electric vehicle charging station"" filters, although the listings can be outdated. Always confirm directly with the hotel about whether chargers are free, guest-only, or limited to specific hours. And here's something to keep in mind: most hotel stations are Level 2 chargers, which provide 10 to 20 miles of range per hour. If you're rolling in late with a low battery, plan accordingly.

The major hotel chains are also getting on board. More than 1,400 Hilton hotels in the US offer EV charging (though it's not necessarily free). Hyatt, IHG, and Marriott all have EV charging filters on their websites and apps. Many travelers agree that Omni Hotels is actually one of the best options—many locations offer complimentary EV charging included with standard parking.

Tips to consider:

Don't assume that all chargers are compatible with your car. Tesla Destination Chargers won't help you if you're driving a Ford, and not every plug fits every vehicle. Call ahead to confirm compatibility.

Understand the rules before you arrive. Some hotels let anyone use chargers on a first-come basis, others make you reserve a spot, and some have valets who'll move your car once it's done charging.

Parking fees make more sense when charging is included. Dropping $40-50 on parking stings less when you're getting free electricity that would've cost you $15-30 at a public fast charger.

Why Hotels Need to Offer EV Charging

Here's the thing—only 26.6% of hotels have installed EV charging stations, according to a study by Responsible Stay.

TownePark explains that EV sales have been skyrocketing, with about 1.2 million EVs sold in the US in 2023. By 2030, EVs could account for around 65% of new car sales in major markets.

For hotels, this isn't just about keeping up; it's about not losing business. EV owners plan their trips around charging availability, and they'll pick hotels that have chargers over ones that don't.

Additionally, there's the sustainability aspect to consider. Having EV chargers boosts green certifications, improves ratings on sustainability-focused platforms, and attracts corporate clients with strict environmental policies.

But it's not just about attracting guests. There's actual money to be made. While guests wait for their cars to charge, they're more likely to visit the hotel's restaurant, bar, or spa, which generates more ancillary revenue. Plus, EV owners typically earn over $100,000 per year, making them a highly sought-after demographic willing to pay premium prices.

The financial incentives are there, too. The Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for up to 30% of equipment and installation costs, with a max of $100,000 per charger. Some states, such as California, even mandate the installation of EV charging infrastructure in new hotels and motels. Hotels that don't adapt risk falling behind as this becomes standard, not a luxury.

People who commented on Parikh’s post were torn. Some feel that the inconvenience is a reason to eschew EVs. Others agree with the creator that hotels should add chargers if they can.

""Reason number 17282727 not to buy an electric car,"" wrote one.

""Fr even with a few basic level 2s would be great,"" said another.

""Find your own charger. Hotels also don’t provide gas. Fuel is your responsibility,"" a third griped

""Then it has to be hotel guests only for the code, or else other EV owners will tie it up,"" another added.

But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries' inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change.
“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to the wrath of extreme weather. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries' inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline, was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deal shows ""that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,"" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Absent from the talks was the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said, referring to the United States’ withdrawal from the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. “But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity — rock-solid in support of climate cooperation.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong that do Lago temporarily halted the session to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object but were ignored.

Do Lago apologized.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Critics complained there was not much to the deal.

""Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

After the main deal was approved, tempers flared as the open meeting stretched on. Russia’s ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren’t prepared to share them with everyone.”

An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause.

The SMR project marks a major shift in the U.K.’s approach to nuclear energy, as it develops the first two major conventional nuclear plants in several decades and invests in new nuclear technologies.
In November, the government announced plans to develop a first-of-its-kind nuclear power station on the Welsh island of Anglesey.
Meanwhile, the U.K. energy minister, Ed Miliband, said that Britain is in the race for new reactors.
While the new project offers high hopes for the development of the U.K.’s nuclear energy industry, U.S. President Trump is less than happy with Prime Minister Starmer’s selection of Rolls-Royce for the job.","After selecting Rolls-Royce as the United Kingdom’s preferred bidder to build the country’s first small modular reactors (SMRs), the government has confirmed the start of project development in Wales. The development of SMR technology is expected to help the U.K. expand its nuclear power capacity, as well as become a competitive SMR power. However, the United States Trump administration, which recently signed an agreement with the U.K. for SMR development, does not support the choice of a British company for the development of the technology.

In June, the U.K. government announced that Rolls-Royce SMR had been selected as the preferred bidder to partner with Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) to develop SMRs, subject to final government approvals and contract signature. The government pledged almost $3.3 billion for the SMR programme, expecting to support the creation of 3,000 new skilled jobs and power the equivalent of roughly 3 million homes with clean, domestic energy.

The SMR project marks a major shift in the U.K.’s approach to nuclear energy, as it develops the first two major conventional nuclear plants in several decades and invests in new nuclear technologies. SMRs are smaller and faster to build than conventional nuclear reactors, and their modular nature means that more capacity can be added as required.

In November, the government announced plans to develop a first-of-its-kind nuclear power station on the Welsh island of Anglesey. The plant at Wylfa will be home to three SMRs, although it will have space for up to eight, with works expected to commence in 2026 and first power generation in the mid-2030s.

The existing nuclear plant at Wylfa was powered down in 2015, and previous plans for a large-scale replacement were scrapped in 2021. The new project is expected to bring a much-needed boost to Anglesey’s economy, as well as provide jobs for several decades. Prime Minister Kier Starmer said, “Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia have meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind. Today, that changes.""

The First Minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, supports the project and has been “pressing the case at every opportunity for Wylfa's incredible benefits”. Meanwhile, the U.K. energy minister, Ed Miliband, said that Britain is in the race for new reactors. Miliband said in a radio interview that the aim is to “work with local colleges to make sure that there are local skills providers, skills training opportunities, so local people get these jobs”.

The SMRs will be built in a modular format in factories before being shipped to site to be assembled. However, several challenges remain, including getting regulatory approval, building the SMR factories, and training the workforce to operate the sites. Rolls-Royce will build on its experience developing reactors for Britain’s nuclear submarines to develop the SMRs. Since promoting its SMR business, the British firm has attracted several investors, including the UAE’s sovereign wealth fund – the Qatar Investment Authority, the American utility Constellation, and CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

While the new project offers high hopes for the development of the U.K.’s nuclear energy industry, U.S. President Trump is less than happy with Prime Minister Starmer’s selection of Rolls-Royce for the job. The U.S. was reportedly hoping that the U.K. government would choose American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop a conventional nuclear plant at Wylfa.

Before the Anglesey project was announced, the U.S. ambassador Warren Stephens published a statement saying that Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales. “We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” Stephens stated. The ambassador’s response follows the signing of a nuclear partnership between the U.K. and the U.S. in September, with a potential value of $100 billion.

However, a source close to the U.K. government said, “This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR programme, producing homegrown clean power with a British company, and we have chosen the best site for it.”

Nevertheless, the U.K. government said that developing SMRs at Wylfa “doesn’t close the door"" to a U.S. manufacturer working on a future project. GBE-N is also assessing different sites in the U.K. for the potential development of another large-scale nuclear power plant, like Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell C in Suffolk, which are currently being developed and are expected to power around six million homes once complete.

Despite the agreement for greater cooperation between the U.K. and the U.S. on nuclear power, the U.K. government has chosen a British company to develop its first SMR project, showing its support for the development of domestic nuclear technologies. The project is expected to make the U.K. highly competitive in the field of SMR reactor development over the coming decade, as well as diversify the country’s nuclear power industry.

It's time to change that. - The Hill,"Kevin Schrum, opinion contributor, Kevin Schrum, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5617584-guardrail-standards-electric-vehicles/,"Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures.
Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.
Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.
As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.
Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought.","When a 7,000-pound electric pickup truck tore through a guardrail at highway speed during a crash test, it confirmed what many safety experts fear: The protective systems lining America’s roads are not ready for the next generation of vehicles.

Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures. Recent testing and on-road crashes have underscored the danger, with electric cars and trucks overwhelming highway barriers designed for lighter vehicles.

Although the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s Highway Safety Improvement Program is funding roadway upgrades through 2026, a critical safety issue is being overlooked.

Modernizing the nation’s guardrail systems has slipped behind the push to build a nationwide network of vehicle charging stations. Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August. U.S. electric vehicle sales reached record levels in the third quarter of 2025, partly due to the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit, with overall sales reaching a 9.1 percent market share in July, and 11.7 percent in the third quarter. Continued strong growth is predicted, driven by falling battery costs and more affordable models coming to market.

Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.

Electric vehicles are literally changing the physics of roadway safety. Their added weight accelerates damage to roadway pavement, increasing the risk of accidents.

And, when crashes occur, that same weight can turn a collision with a guardrail into catastrophic failure. Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.

Consider some of the dangers presented. As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. The GMC Hummer electric SUV tops the charts weighing in at over 9,000 pounds. That extra weight increases the stress on pavement and, critically, poses new risks when vehicles collide with guardrails — the absolute last line of defense keeping cars from leaving the roadway.

Guardrails are designed to absorb and redirect the force of a crash, but many of the hundreds of thousands installed nationwide are outdated or improperly installed. In the most catastrophic failures, defective guardrails have pierced vehicles rather than protect them.

The risk escalates with Electric vehicles. Their added weight, lower center of gravity and softer structure in the front, combined with higher highway speeds, means today’s guardrails are often no match.

In fact, the first-of-their-kind crash tests at Texas A&M and the University of Nebraska over the last two years revealed that standard guardrail designs fail under electric vehicle impacts. A Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1T both tore through guardrails during controlled tests, demonstrating the critical need for new engineering standards.

Sadly, these warnings are no longer confined to laboratories. As it stands, thousands of Americans die each year in car accidents where guardrails and other highway infrastructure fails. In recent years, electric vehicles have overwhelmed roadside protections. Each crash underscores the fact that today’s infrastructure is not designed for tomorrow’s vehicles.

An update to guardrail standards is long overdue. Many roadside safety features continue to be tested at speeds pegged at 60 to 62 mph, whereas highway speeds have climbed past 80 mph in many states. When you factor in the weight of an electric vehicle and its lower center of gravity, the deadly mismatch becomes obvious.

Additionally, it has been nearly 10 years since the Government Accountability Office reported any flaws in the Federal Highway Administration’s guardrail testing program. To close this safety gap, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy should prioritize guardrail safety across the country.

There are four specific things to be done:

The Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, which sets federal guardrail standards for state Departments of Transportation, should update guardrail design and testing standards to reflect electric vehicle weight and current speed trends.

In partnership with state Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation should prioritize the replacement of outdated guardrails nationwide.

The Federal Highway Safety Administration should encourage collaboration between the makers of both EVs and traditional vehicles and highway safety engineers to develop roadway safety solutions that anticipate the realities of future vehicles for decades to come.

America is at a crossroads. Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought. Real progress requires broad national investment. That kind of commitment ensures that all Americans in every type of vehicle are protected when traveling our nation’s roadways.

The final text did add a reference to the “UAE consensus”, the overall package from Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 that contained the first pledge to move away from fossil fuels.
Roadmap for transition away from fossil fuels survives – but it is voluntary The roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels was blocked from the formal Cop30 decision and the Brazilian presidency announced the plan would proceed outside the UN process.
Rainforest conference fails to create deforestation roadmap … Cop30 was deliberately sited in the Amazon to put focus on the vital role in climate of forests.
But it was killed after being tied to the fossil fuels roadmap.","1. Multilateralism survived … just

The negotiations between more than 190 countries came close to collapse, as ambitious countries and petrostates threatened to block any deal or walk out. But global heating requires a global response and in today’s fractured geopolitical climate sealing a deal backed by all countries keeps the UN climate show on the road.

“At a time of great political challenge, 194 countries have come together within the Paris agreement to recommit to acting on the climate crisis,” said the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband. “This agreement does not have all the ambition we would have wanted but it commits to keeping 1.5C alive.”

The US did not send a delegation – Donald Trump has dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job”. Some at Cop30 in Belém said the US stance had emboldened Saudi Arabia and other petrostates to fight even harder to block progress.

2. Adaptation funding tripled – but critics say it isn’t enough

The nations at Cop30 agreed to triple funding for adaptation – money provided by rich countries and desperately needed by vulnerable countries to protect their people from the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis. It is a significant advance but the goal of $120bn (£92bn) a year was pushed back five years from the initial suggested date of 2030.

Many countries and observers reacted angrily. “The outcome on adaptation is an insult to every community currently underwater or on fire,” said Harjeet Singh at the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “The refusal to commit to scaling up finance to the necessary $300bn annually for adaptation leaves the unprepared defenceless against inevitable ruin. The timeline ignores the urgency of the climate disasters striking us today.”

3. Plan for a just transition welcomed

A major outcome was the agreement of a just transition mechanism (JTM), a plan to ensure that the move to a green economy around the world takes place fairly and protects the rights of all people, including workers, women and Indigenous people.

Climate Action Network International, a huge coalition of campaign groups, welcomed the JTM as one of the strongest rights-based outcomes in the history of the UN climate negotiations.

“The adoption of JTM was a win shaped by years of pressure from civil society,” said Tasneem Essop, the executive director of the network. “This outcome didn’t fall from the sky: it was carved out through struggle, persistence and the moral clarity of those living on the frontlines of climate breakdown. Governments must now honour this JTM with real action. Anything less is a betrayal.” Efforts early in the talks to attach funding to the JTM failed.

4. No mention of fossil fuels in final text

Fossil fuels were not mentioned in the key final decision, despite a coalition of 90 developed and developing nations having pushed for a commitment to a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels to be included. Petrostates including Saudi Arabia and its allies fought fiercely to block this and succeeded.

The final text did add a reference to the “UAE consensus”, the overall package from Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 that contained the first pledge to move away from fossil fuels. However, the obliqueness of this reference is a retrograde step according to Dr Joanna Depledge, a Cop expert at the University of Cambridge: “The UAE consensus is [a] broad package including fully eight decisions adopted in Dubai on a whole range of issues. The Dubai fossil fuel transition language is therefore being deliberately diluted and obscured, not highlighted.”

5. Roadmap for transition away from fossil fuels survives – but it is voluntary

The roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels was blocked from the formal Cop30 decision and the Brazilian presidency announced the plan would proceed outside the UN process. It will be merged with a plan backed by Colombia and about 90 other countries, with a summit set for April. This “coalition of the willing” could push progress forward.

The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, said the plan to develop the roadmap had the support of President Lula and would involve high-level dialogues over the next year, led by science and involving governments, industry and civil society. Once complete, he said they would report back to Cop.

“Those governments committed to tackling the climate crisis at its source are uniting to move forward outside the UN, under the leadership of Colombia and Pacific Island states, to phase out fossil fuels rapidly, equitably, and in line with 1.5C,” said Nikki Reisch, at the Center for International Environmental Law. “The international conference next April is the first stop on the path to a livable future.”

6. Rainforest conference fails to create deforestation roadmap …

Cop30 was deliberately sited in the Amazon to put focus on the vital role in climate of forests. Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, tried to include a roadmap on ending deforestation in the core agreement at Belém.

But it was killed after being tied to the fossil fuels roadmap. The tying of the two appears to have been either an awful diplomatic blunder or sabotage by the Brazilian foreign ministry, which has long had a focus on selling the country’s oil abroad.

Toerris Jaeger, of Rainforest Foundation Norway, said: “The Amazon insisted on being heard. She forced her way into the climate negotiations with tropical heat, torrential rain, and the largest Indigenous delegation of any previous Cop.

“It is disappointing that countries did not agree to develop concrete plans to halt deforestation.”

7. … but new fund launched to help keep trees standing

Brazil did launch the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, again outside the UN process, but a multibillion-dollar investment fund that will pay nations to keep trees standing.

“The TFFF reflects a growing recognition that climate integrity and forest protection are inseparable,” said Dr Fernando Barrio, at Queen Mary University of London. “Whether it will be effective depends on its design. But the political signal is important because there is no path to 1.5C that does not involve ending deforestation this decade.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/037a5a1f3bc501c6f59891bed429b1289c51258b/112_0_2478_1983/master/2478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a45e322850ae4ae7484206b3f5519f1c",N,,2025-11-22 19:59:01.301807

According to a fresh assessment by rating agency ICRA, the country’s renewable contribution is likely to exceed 35% by FY2030, marking a major shift in India’s long-term energy trajectory. This projection underscores the nation’s continued push to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen sustainable power infrastructure.

Surge in RE Capacity Additions

ICRA highlights that India has been expanding its renewable capacity at a robust pace. Solar and wind projects remain at the forefront of this growth, supported by competitive tariffs, improved financing conditions, and strong policy backing. Moreover, large-scale tenders issued by central and state agencies have created a substantial project pipeline, ensuring that RE additions will maintain steady momentum through the decade.

The agency also notes that hybrid and round-the-clock renewable projects—combining solar, wind, and energy storage—are helping to address issues of intermittency and grid stability.

Policy Support and Industry Confidence

ICRA’s report emphasises that government initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar manufacturing, revised renewable purchase obligations (RPOs), and accelerated transmission development are further boosting investor confidence. In addition, improved land availability mechanisms and faster approval processes are drawing more private players into the sector.

As per Financial Express, industry experts believe these reforms have positioned India to achieve one of the fastest renewable growth rates globally, even as power demand continues to rise.

Impact on Thermal Generation and Grid Operations

The increasing share of renewable energy will gradually reshape the dynamics of India’s power sector. With RE steadily expanding, the reliance on conventional coal-based generation is expected to moderate. Consequently, thermal plants may see reduced utilisation levels, prompting a shift toward flexible operations and efficiency upgrades.

ICRA also points out that transmission infrastructure and energy storage solutions will remain crucial to managing the growing inflow of variable renewable power. Strengthening inter-regional transmission corridors and scaling battery storage capacity will be essential steps to ensure grid reliability.

Outlook for the Coming Years

Looking ahead, ICRA projects a strong and steady expansion of renewable energy capacity between FY2025 and FY2030. The rating agency expects annual capacity additions to remain healthy, driven by both utility-scale projects and the rising adoption of rooftop solar across commercial, industrial, and residential segments.",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Renewable-Energy-Share-in-Indias-Power-Mix-Poised-to-Cross-35-by-FY2030-ICRA.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 18:00:23.477701

However, the accord dodged an explicit mention of the oil, gas and coal responsible for driving the bulk of climate change, and it didn’t detail plans for shifting away from them, leaving some countries unhappy with the outcome.

The eight-page declaration forged at the COP30 summit on the edge of the Amazon rain forest won grudging acceptance. Many nations argued more must be done to counter climate change, while also conceding that an imperfect package was better than none at all.

“With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop, COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction,” said Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa advocacy group. “But considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion.”

Leaders at the summit in Belém, Brazil, had encouraged countries to accept a final deal even if it didn’t have everything they wanted. They insisted it was necessary to show nations were linking arms to fight climate change at a time when other multilateral diplomacy is fraying.

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

The agreement from the COP30 summit responds to a looming gap between what’s necessary to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and what countries are actually doing or committed to pursuing.

Under the decision adopted Saturday, the COP presidency would run a new voluntary initiative meant to “accelerate implementation” of action needed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels — a key threshold identified in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

From the EPA’s press release:

“The agency’s proposed definition of WOTUS would fully implement the [Supreme] court’s direction [from Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency] by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies. It will accelerate economic prosperity by revising, for example, exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems and by adding an exclusion for groundwater.

My Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act Passes the U.S. House

I am thrilled that my legislation to slash red tape, streamline American LNG exports, and prevent a future LNG export ban like the one imposed by former President Biden passed through the U.S. House of Representatives this week.

The Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act depoliticizes the export of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) by eliminating a duplicative requirement for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to authorize its export. This gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sole authority over the approval process, which provides producers certainty, strengthens global security, and lowers costs for domestic consumers.

The passage of my legislation is another major victory in achieving American energy dominance. It’s simple: Exporting American LNG strengthens our economy, stabilizes prices, drives much-needed investment in energy infrastructure, and bolsters the energy security of our global partners.

Countering Foreign Adversarial Influence in America

This week, I introduced a package of bills to counter foreign adversarial influence in America. The package includes three critical, bipartisan, bicameral bills that will prevent senior government officials from ever lobbying on behalf of an adversarial nation such as China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran.

It is the bare minimum expectation that U.S. government employees work for the betterment of America, both during their service and long after it. Yet far too often, we see individuals leave government only to lobby on behalf of foreign adversaries who wish to see America fail. This is a dangerous flaw in the incentive structure for those serving at the highest levels of government, and we must fix it to prevent foreign entities from gaining influence from within.

By permanently banning former senior government officials from lobbying for countries of concern, closing FARA loopholes, and stripping security clearances from any former Department of War (DOW) personnel who lobby for China, these commonsense measures move us one step closer to ensuring that those in Washington are here to serve America, not undermine it.

Honoring Those Who Perished in the July 4th Floods

The tragedy our state endured on July 4th, 2025, was unimaginable, and we must never forget the innocent lives lost. Earlier this year, I joined Congressman Chip Roy (TX-21) in introducing a resolution honoring those who didn’t make it home and recognizing the extraordinary bravery and selflessness of the heroes who stepped up when they were needed most.

While nothing can ever bring loved ones back, we must honor their life and legacy for years to come, and that is precisely what this resolution does. I am thankful that my colleagues in the U.S. House voted to pass it this week, and I will continue to pray for every single person and community that was impacted.

Generative AI Terrorism Act Passes U.S. House

I spent two decades as a fighter pilot, flying combat missions in the Middle East against terrorist organizations. Since then, I have witnessed the terror landscape evolve into a digital battlefield shaped by the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. To confront this emerging threat and stop terrorist organizations from weaponizing AI to recruit, train, and inspire attacks on U.S. soil, I am proud that the House passed my Generative AI Terrorism Risk Assessment Act this week.

While my uniform has changed, my mission to protect the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, has not. From the cockpit to serving as Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, I know how critical it is for our policies and capabilities to keep pace with the threats of tomorrow.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to extreme weather’s wrath. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the United Nations conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline to wrap up, was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago’s office.

Do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.” Do Lago has said a fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by his team.

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the overall deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved and gaveled in by do Lago — to applause by many delegates — angry nation after angry nation took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago as moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong and uniform that do Lago temporarily halted the session for more talk to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez objected to sections on helping nations cut emissions and reaching worldwide temperature limits that were previously agreed upon. She blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

One of the areas that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention after a text was approved. The gaveled-in deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how well nations are adapting to future climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

Country after country – including Panama, Uruguay, and Canada – said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object, raising flags to be noticed so they can speak, but were ignored.

Do Lago said he was sorry he didn’t see the flags.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Even though most nations proclaimed themselves somewhat but not wholly satisfied with the major package, critics complained there was not much to the deal.

“It’s a weak outcome,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International. “Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: the emperor has no clothes.”

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

“COP30 was a failure for the communities on the front lines of the climate crisis,” said the disaster charity Mercy Corps’ policy lead Debbie Hillier. “While the COP30 outcome includes a new commitment on adaptation finance, it is deeply disappointing. It includes no baseline year, no clarity on the actual target, and no mechanism defining who is responsible for delivering the tripling.”

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

The draft text, confirmed by one person close to the talks, did salvage a passing reference to a 2023 agreement to transition away from fossil fuels — while not mentioning the fuels themselves. Oil-rich Arab countries had fought to exorcise that deal from the record of climate talks.

The person was granted anonymity in order to discuss the details of the draft deal.

The proposal would also set up a meeting next year “to exchange experiences and views on related matters” — an oblique reference to a proposed post-fossil-fuel roadmap.

The deal also agreed to a tripling of funding to help poorer countries adapt to the painful effects of climate change by 2035. That’s more than wealthy governments had said they were willing to agree to in the negotiations, but poorer countries that had sought a 2030 timeline have decried it as wholly inadequate in the face of devastating droughts, floods and fires driven by the superheated climate.

The COP30 talks, which have been running for almost two weeks, have struggled to shake off the shadow of Washington’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. The Trump administration did not send delegates to the talks and is universally expected to reject any outcome.

It's time to change that. - Yahoo,"Kevin Schrum, opinion contributor",,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-us-guardrails-aren-t-140000915.html,"Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures.
Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August.
Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.
Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.
As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.","When a 7,000-pound electric pickup truck tore through a guardrail at highway speed during a crash test, it confirmed what many safety experts fear: The protective systems lining America’s roads are not ready for the next generation of vehicles.

Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures. Recent testing and on-road crashes have underscored the danger, with electric cars and trucks overwhelming highway barriers designed for lighter vehicles.

Although the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s Highway Safety Improvement Program is funding roadway upgrades through 2026, a critical safety issue is being overlooked.

Modernizing the nation’s guardrail systems has slipped behind the push to build a nationwide network of vehicle charging stations. Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August. U.S. electric vehicle sales reached record levels in the third quarter of 2025, partly due to the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit, with overall sales reaching a 9.1 percent market share in July, and 11.7 percent in the third quarter. Continued strong growth is predicted, driven by falling battery costs and more affordable models coming to market.

Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.

Electric vehicles are literally changing the physics of roadway safety. Their added weight accelerates damage to roadway pavement, increasing the risk of accidents.

And, when crashes occur, that same weight can turn a collision with a guardrail into catastrophic failure. Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.

Consider some of the dangers presented. As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. The GMC Hummer electric SUV tops the charts weighing in at over 9,000 pounds. That extra weight increases the stress on pavement and, critically, poses new risks when vehicles collide with guardrails — the absolute last line of defense keeping cars from leaving the roadway.

Guardrails are designed to absorb and redirect the force of a crash, but many of the hundreds of thousands installed nationwide are outdated or improperly installed. In the most catastrophic failures, defective guardrails have pierced vehicles rather than protect them.

The risk escalates with Electric vehicles. Their added weight, lower center of gravity and softer structure in the front, combined with higher highway speeds, means today’s guardrails are often no match.

In fact, the first-of-their-kind crash tests at Texas A&M and the University of Nebraska over the last two years revealed that standard guardrail designs fail under electric vehicle impacts. A Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1T both tore through guardrails during controlled tests, demonstrating the critical need for new engineering standards.

Sadly, these warnings are no longer confined to laboratories. As it stands, thousands of Americans die each year in car accidents where guardrails and other highway infrastructure fails. In recent years, electric vehicles have overwhelmed roadside protections. Each crash underscores the fact that today’s infrastructure is not designed for tomorrow’s vehicles.

An update to guardrail standards is long overdue. Many roadside safety features continue to be tested at speeds pegged at 60 to 62 mph, whereas highway speeds have climbed past 80 mph in many states. When you factor in the weight of an electric vehicle and its lower center of gravity, the deadly mismatch becomes obvious.

Additionally, it has been nearly 10 years since the Government Accountability Office reported any flaws in the Federal Highway Administration’s guardrail testing program. To close this safety gap, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy should prioritize guardrail safety across the country.

There are four specific things to be done:

The Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, which sets federal guardrail standards for state Departments of Transportation, should update guardrail design and testing standards to reflect electric vehicle weight and current speed trends.

In partnership with state Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation should prioritize the replacement of outdated guardrails nationwide.

The Federal Highway Safety Administration should encourage collaboration between the makers of both EVs and traditional vehicles and highway safety engineers to develop roadway safety solutions that anticipate the realities of future vehicles for decades to come.

America is at a crossroads. Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought. Real progress requires broad national investment. That kind of commitment ensures that all Americans in every type of vehicle are protected when traveling our nation’s roadways.

These investment decisions happened before the tax credit expired, signaling that manufacturers saw the collapse coming and adjusted accordingly.
October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% in a single month after the tax credit expired, falling from 98,289 units in September to just 74,897 units.
Europe saw EV sales stagnate in 2024 as subsidy schemes waned, but the sales share remained around 20%.
Back in June, we covered Senate Republicans pushing to end the tax credit and immediately flagged the impending crisis.","US clean-energy investments hit a record $75 billion in the third quarter of 2025, driven almost entirely by consumers scrambling to buy electric vehicles before federal tax credits expired on September 30, according to new data from Rhodium Group and MIT.

But the headline number conceals a brutal truth: EV manufacturing investments collapsed 30% compared to the same period last year, and companies canceled $2 billion worth of battery projects.

The contradiction reveals exactly what happens when an industry built on government subsidies faces actual market conditions. Record consumer spending driven by desperation, paired with manufacturers abandoning ship before the policy cliff even arrives.

The Rush Before The Fall

Zero-emission vehicle sales reached $31.2 billion in Q3 2025, marking a 32% increase from the previous quarter as buyers raced to claim the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used vehicles.

Congress eliminated these incentives through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July 2025, setting the September 30 deadline that triggered the purchasing frenzy.

The surge mirrors the pre-deadline panic EVXL documented throughout summer 2025, when dealers offered approximately $9,800 in additional incentives and Tesla prominently displayed banners warning buyers to take delivery before the cutoff.

But this wasn’t sustainable growth. It was a fire sale.

Manufacturing Investment Craters

While consumers rushed to buy, manufacturers were heading for the exits.

EV manufacturing sector investments dropped 30%, or $8 billion, compared to Q3 2024, according to the Rhodium Group analysis. Companies also canceled $2 billion worth of battery manufacturing projects during the same quarter.

The timing is critical. These investment decisions happened before the tax credit expired, signaling that manufacturers saw the collapse coming and adjusted accordingly.

General Motors announced in late October it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.”

Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely, while the company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025.

The Post-Subsidy Reality

The fourth quarter validated manufacturers’ pessimism with stunning speed.

October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% in a single month after the tax credit expired, falling from 98,289 units in September to just 74,897 units.

Light vehicle sales overall decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units, marking the lowest sales pace in 15 months.

The carnage extended across America’s $28 billion Battery Belt, where GM idled $2 billion battery plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee barely two months after the credit expired.

Battery plants designed for thousands of workers sit largely empty. Multibillion-dollar facilities remain unfinished shells. The promised 5,000 jobs at Ford’s Kentucky plant turned into 1,450 actual positions.

Global Context Shows US Lagging

The Rhodium report notes that globally, EVs are rising in more countries even amid US policy headwinds, though they remain heavily concentrated in China, the EU, and US, according to International Energy Agency data.

China sold over 11 million EVs in 2024, with electric cars accounting for almost half of all car sales. The country is projected to reach around 60% EV market share in 2025, supported by continued government incentives and falling prices.

Europe saw EV sales stagnate in 2024 as subsidy schemes waned, but the sales share remained around 20%. New emissions standards taking effect in 2025 are expected to drive European EV sales to a 25% market share.

The US, meanwhile, is experiencing the textbook consequences of removing subsidies without building genuine market demand.

Heat Pumps And Storage Face Same Fate

Tax credits for two other types of consumer-facing clean technology face the same September 30 fate: heat pumps and distributed power and storage systems are set to lose their incentives at year’s end.

The pattern is repeating. The question is whether those sectors will see the same panic-buy surge followed by investment collapse.

EVXL’s Take

This Rhodium Group data is the smoking gun that validates every warning EVXL published throughout summer 2025 about subsidy-dependent markets.

Back in June, we covered Senate Republicans pushing to end the tax credit and immediately flagged the impending crisis. When the bill passed on July 4, we explained exactly what would happen: a brief surge as buyers rushed to beat the deadline, followed by a devastating collapse.

The Rhodium numbers prove we were right, but the timing is even more damning than we expected. Manufacturers weren’t just pulling back after the subsidy expired. They were abandoning investments during Q3 2025 while the subsidies still existed and consumer sales were surging.

That $8 billion manufacturing investment decline happened in the same quarter that saw record consumer spending. Let that sink in. Companies watched Americans spend $31 billion on EVs and responded by cutting factory investments by 30%.

Why? Because they knew those sales were artificial. Pull-forward demand driven by policy panic, not sustainable market dynamics.

The October collapse validated their judgment. EV sales cratered 24% the moment the subsidies ended. Within weeks, GM idled $2 billion in battery plants and laid off 3,300 workers. Ford stopped making F-150 Lightnings with no restart timeline announced.

The broader pattern across America’s $28 billion Battery Belt tells the complete story: stalled construction sites, mass layoffs, and desperate pivots to non-EV products. Despite $28 billion in taxpayer subsidies, the grand vision of Midwest EV dominance collapsed just six weeks after federal tax credits expired.

Compare this to China’s approach. Chinese manufacturers achieved genuine cost advantages through integrated supply chains and manufacturing efficiency. Two-thirds of EVs sold in China in 2024 were priced lower than their ICE equivalents, even without subsidies. That’s actual competitiveness, not subsidy dependency.

European automakers are struggling too, but they’re facing genuine market forces like overcapacity and Chinese competition, not the sudden removal of the training wheels that were holding up their entire business model.

The heat pump and distributed storage sectors should be watching closely. Their tax credits expire December 31, 2025. If the pattern holds, expect a Q4 buying surge followed by a manufacturing investment collapse in early 2026.

What’s particularly galling is how the $75 billion headline number will be spun by advocates as proof that clean energy investment remains strong. That figure is technically accurate but fundamentally misleading. Strip out the panic-driven consumer purchases, and you’re left with an industry in retreat.

This echoes patterns we’ve documented at our sister site DroneXL, where protectionist policies and subsidy-dependent business models often backfire spectacularly. When you build an industry on government support rather than genuine competitive advantages, removing that support exposes the weakness immediately.

The Trump administration is now touting a vehicle loan interest deduction as a replacement benefit, but that provides a fraction of the support the $7,500 credit offered. It’s political theater designed to distract from the wreckage.

Looking ahead six months, expect continued consolidation in the US EV market. Startups without deep pockets will disappear. Traditional automakers will scale back EV commitments further. Chinese manufacturers will continue gaining global market share while American battery plants sit idle.

The Rhodium report inadvertently documents the precise moment when subsidy-dependent industrial policy hit the wall. Record investment numbers masking catastrophic structural retreat. It’s exactly what EVXL predicted, and exactly what happens when you confuse government support with actual market demand.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0144.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 15:00:33.253928

The annual talks are this year being held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and it wasn’t clear when they may finish.

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said Friday that the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from the conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil, because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor to strengthen climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year.

Before nations moved into high-level negotiations behind closed doors, Monterrey Gomez warned that talks were on “the verge of collapse.” A few hours later, he said nothing much had changed.

Do Lago started the day telling diplomats he thought they “are very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. When the all-country talks fizzled, do Lago pivoted to bringing in smaller pairings of negotiating teams for meeting in his office.

Talks behind schedule

“I would expect there needs to be another text,” veteran observer and former chief German climate negotiator Jennifer Morgan said late Friday afternoon. “I think there’s quite a lot of work to be done.”

The Brazilian proposals — also called texts — came on the heels of a fire on Thursday that briefly spread through pavilions of the conference known as COP30 on the edge of the Amazon. No one was seriously hurt but the fire meant that a day of work was largely lost.

“The problem is we’re 24 hours behind schedule,” said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute.

Cold reception from many

The European Union said flatly that it wouldn’t accept the text. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.

“Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU. “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.”

“After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.”

A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions.

Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it.

More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement.

“Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries.

Tackling fossil fuels

On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.”

The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions-curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map.

The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate-vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.”

Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.”

Getting everyone in one room

Agreements at these talks are officially reached when no nation objects and typically require many rounds of negotiations. In practice, the proceedings can end with agreements adopted and the presidency adjourning the meeting after noting any objections.

Instead of the usual small group meetings, the Brazilian presidency convened a meeting of nations’ top officials behind closed doors for much of Friday. It’s designed to lessen any nation feeling left out of backroom deals, but it doesn’t let the public see countries’ objections.

After a few hours it broke up with no sign of success and do Lago trying a different strategy.

The final deal emerging from a difficult final day of negotiations near the mouth of the Amazon calls for enhanced efforts by nations to curb the Earth’s rising temperatures and provide poorer, particularly vulnerable countries with assurances of funding to deal with the impacts of a hotter planet. But it offers money less quickly than those nations would have wanted, due to resistance from Europe and other rich countries.

The COP30 agreement also points to expansions of the worldwide clean energy economy, calling the transition toward reduced planet-warming pollution and more climate-resilient development “irreversible and the trend of the future.”

It was a stronger outcome than what the talks’ Brazilian hosts had proposed in the final days of the talks. The negotiations faced multiple headwinds, including the United States’ refusal to attend the summit at all.

But the agreement still only alludes to a push by 82 nations, including many in Europe, for a concrete process to speed up the worldwide transition away from fossil fuels. That proposal had drawn objections from major oil- and natural-gas-producing nations, which have pointed to rising energy demand as a driver of the continued need for output.

Instead, countries agreed to take marginal steps to accelerate their climate efforts while “striving” to do better, a phrase that China — the world’s clean energy superpower, second-biggest economy and largest greenhouse gas polluter — has used to refer to its own targets.

Brazil also pushed a side deal for creating two separate “roadmaps” that would outline a path toward winding down fossil fuel use and ending deforestation. Colombia and the Netherlands, strong advocates of a fossil fuel phase out, had announced Friday they would co-host a summit next year to move that effort forward.

“As president of this conference, it is my duty to recognize some very important discussions that took place in Belem and that need to continue during the Brazilian presidency … even if they are not reflected in these texts we just approved,” COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago said following the final gaveling.

“There was no backtracking, there was a bit of progress,” said German climate minister Carsten Schneider. “I would have liked to see much more, but we also wanted a COP that produces results and shows that multilateralism works, even if it is incredibly difficult.”

The final text is nonbinding, and even a firm reiteration of a previous summit’s 2023 pledge to eventually phase out oil, gas and coal would have no effect on countries such as the United States that are aggressively moving to expand their production and exports of fossil fuels. But the less-than-resounding support for taking that pledge forward raises questions about whether countries remained united behind a goal they had described as historic just two years ago, according to delegates who expressed disappointment Saturday.

The 13 days of talks by nearly 200 countries in the northern Brazilian port city of Belém had taken place without U.S. delegates present — a first for the annual global climate talks — after President Donald Trump dismissed the entire effort to avert the Earth’s warming as a “hoax” and a “con job.”

Trump announced in January that he was once again withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement, the global climate pact whose goals had provided a basis for this month’s negotiations.

The absence of a strong U.S. push for a climate deal, something Washington had provided at previous talks under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, allowed a bloc of emerging economies and petro-states to scrub the final text of any explicit mention of the fuels driving climate change.

EU members, while initially split over whether to endorse the roadmap on fossil fuels, had railed against the snub on Friday and were prepared to walk away from the summit on the final day without a deal.

But the bloc won a handful of small concessions overnight, and after hours of discussions early Saturday morning decided to endorse the slightly tweaked text.

“We would have liked to have more,” EU climate chief Wopke Hoekstra said, but “we do think we should support it because at least it goes in the right direction.”

The 2023 U.N. climate summit in the United Arab Emirates — a major oil and gas producer in its own right — had urged countries to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”

In the years since, fossil fuel production has continued rising. At the same time, though, use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have taken off, thanks in large part to lower costs and rising exports of gear from China.

But China, which still describes itself as a developing country, declined to step into a political leadership position at the talks, despite having a major presence at the summit and a predominant role in the world’s clean energy supply chains. That left the European Union and more progressive climate countries, such as Colombia and the United Kingdom, isolated in pushing for a more ambitious deal without U.S. backing.

As the COP30 host and president, Brazil had placed a priority on connecting the talks to the real economy and sending a message that global cooperation on climate is still alive and breathing. The final deal achieved that aim, but just.

“At a time of great political challenge, 193 countries have come together within the Paris Agreement to recommit to acting on the climate crisis,” said UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. “We fought hard for this outcome because it is crucial to protect future generations and because of the economic opportunities today from clean energy.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1d/0b/b5e57e0c46c3a36b514917b505c6/climate-cop30-65571.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 19:00:06.439118

Countries meeting in Brazil for two weeks could manage only a voluntary agreement to begin discussions on a roadmap to an eventual phase-out of fossil fuels, and they achieved this incremental progress only in the teeth of implacable opposition from oil-producing countries.

The talks were hauled back from the brink of collapse in an all-night session into Saturday morning, after a bitter standoff between a coalition of more than 80 developed and developing countries, and a group led by Saudi Arabia and its allies plus Russia.

There was disappointment from campaigners, but relief that the talks had produced at least some progress. Developing countries achieved part of their goal at the global talks, which was a tripling of the financial support available from rich countries to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. They should receive $120bn (£92bn) a year for adaptation, from the $300bn developed countries pledged to them last year, but not until 2035, instead of the 2030 deadline they were demanding. Many had also hoped the increase would be on top of the $300bn.

A roadmap to the halting of deforestation was dropped from the final deal, a bitter disappointment for nature advocates at this “rainforest Cop” held in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River.

The agreement among 194 countries – excluding the US, which did not send a delegation – was reached in the early morning after 12 hours of nonstop extra-time talks among ministers in deserted conference halls, and completed at a closing meeting at 1.35pm, after negotiations were hauled back from the brink of collapse on Friday evening.

Jennifer Morgan, the Cop veteran and former German climate envoy, said: “While far from what’s needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress. The Paris agreement is working, the transition away from fossil fuels agreed in Dubai [at the Cop28 talks in 2023] is accelerating. Despite the efforts of major oil-producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”

Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop, Cop30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion. Despite calling themselves climate leaders, developed countries have betrayed vulnerable nations by failing to deliver science-aligned national emission reduction plans.”

Poor countries must be supported to cope with a crisis not of their making, said Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy for Kenya. “The 30th Cop has reaffirmed both the urgency of climate action, and the disproportionate risks faced by the most vulnerable. Kenya and Africa stand ready to lead in the transition to clean energy, but resilience and adaptation cannot remain afterthoughts for a continent responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “Developed countries must finally honour their finance commitments.”

Efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris agreement, were also addressed in the final text, but less robustly than vulnerable countries had hoped. Before the conference, countries were supposed to present new national plans on cutting emissions, but they fell short of the commitments needed to maintain the 1.5C limit, which has already been breached but which analysts say could be returned to.

Instead of censuring this failure, the conference agreed to set up an “accelerator” programme to address the shortfall in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which will report back at next year’s Cop, to be held in Turkey but presided over by Australia. The text exhorted countries to “full implementation of NDCs while striving to do better”.

The final deal also recognised the “just transition” that social justice campaigners have been calling for, which means helping workers affected by the move away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy. But key provisions on the exploitation of “critical minerals” – which has been accompanied by soaring human rights abuses in some countries – were blocked by China and Russia.

Insiders said the talks came close to foundering on Friday, after a hectic few weeks in Brazil that began with a summit of world leaders held by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and attended by about 50 heads or deputy heads of state.

High-level ministers from Jamaica, Cuba and Mauritius all spoke there of the devastating impact of Hurricane Melissa. “We did not create this crisis, but we refuse to stand as victims,” said Matthew Samuda, Jamaica’s economic growth minister.”

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned of temperature rises that would “push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security”.

But after the leaders left and Cop30 formally began on Monday 10 November, discussions among ministers and high-ranking officials degenerated into a bitter standoff. A fire near the delegation offices on Thursday afternoon, in which no one was seriously hurt, forced evacuation of the conference centre and disrupted negotiations at a crucial stage.

When they resumed late on Thursday evening, the rift was clear: more than 80 countries had declared in favour of including a commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” in the final outcome, but scores of countries – led by the Arab group, which includes Saudi Arabia – lined up against it.

That opposition forced the relegation of the “transition away from fossil fuels” – that scientists say is essential to staving off the worst effects of climate breakdown – to a voluntary commitment rather than the legally binding decision many had hoped for.

Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at ActionAid International, said: “A lack of climate finance is throwing a spanner in the works of climate progress. Global south countries, [which] are already carrying the costs of the climate crisis they have not caused, desperately need support from rich countries if they are to take on any more commitments. Nowhere was this more stark than on the issue of fossil fuels, where specific text once again ended up unfunded and on the cutting-room floor.”

Carolina Pasquali, executive director of Greenpeace Brazil, said: “We must reflect on what was possible, and what is now missing: the roadmaps to end forest destruction, and fossil fuels, and an ongoing lack of finance. More than 80 countries supported a transition away from fossil fuels, but they were blocked from agreeing on this change by countries that refused to support this necessary and urgent step. More than 90 countries supported improved protection of forests. That too did not make it into the final agreement. Unfortunately, the text failed to deliver the scale of change needed.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd6f5163c428444ecc401fc39eadd25ec46276b/333_0_3328_2662/master/3328.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a87701f471fd18f83542d41dd56469e4",N,,2025-11-22 16:00:05.141978

Now, Möeve, formerly known as Cepsa, has announced it is preparing to break ground on Spain’s largest green hydrogen project. The company has noted the astonishing progress in developing the planned facility that will become a landmark achievement in Spain’s energy transition ambitions. The renewable energy sector is undoubtedly the way forward for the international energy sector.

The Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley will become the largest hydrogen project in Spain

Spain has long been searching for the best method to decarbonize its energy sector. Doing so requires a pragmatic approach so as not to disrupt the energy ecosystem in the region. The project, which will become the largest green hydrogen project in Spain once completed, has an eye-watering budget of 3,000 million euros, underscoring Spain’s commitment to reaching its clean energy goals.

The Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley project has been listed by Spain and the EU as an IPCEI (Important Project of Common Interest), and Möeve has stated its ambition to immediately begin construction. The astonishingly large project will consist of an electrolysis plant with a combined capacity of 2 GW, which could potentially produce up to 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually.

The first phase of the project has been dubbed Onuba by the company

The initial phase will consist of a 400 MW electrolysis plant located in Palos de la Frontera, and will mostly focus on producing green hydrogen for both the company’s own facilities and for other interested third parties. According to official data from Möeve, the first phase of the project will create roughly 10,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs for the local populace.

The new green hydrogen project forms part of Spain’s national strategy for the renewable energy sector

Spain’s national strategic plan for renewable energies, known as ERHA PERTE, calls for increased spending and attention on accelerating Spain’s embrace of the hydrogen sector and the renewable one overall. That embrace has not been the trend for other nations that still rely on the gas and oil sectors. Additionally, the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley project will create auxiliary infrastructure, such as:

220 kV underground power lines

substantial connections to local electrical substations

storage plants linked to heavy, maritime, and air transport

decarbonization of critical energy sectors in Spain

The additional necessary infrastructure for the project needs to be considered as well, with Spain needing to build robust electricity grids and industrial-scale gas transport systems. That will most likely come from the astonishing 3,000 million euro price tag to complete the construction phase.

Spain’s hope will be for the project to boost its hydrogen capacity, as the resource can be used to produce renewable fuels and green ammonia, essential to replacing traditional fuels like diesel and other fossil fuels. The European proclivity for the renewable energy sector has become all too real in recent years, with the EU awarding funds for eight hydrogen projects across the bloc.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to the wrath of extreme weather. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline, was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deal shows “that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Absent from the talks was the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said, referring to the United States’ withdrawal from the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. “But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity — rock-solid in support of climate cooperation.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong that do Lago temporarily halted the session to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object but were ignored.

Do Lago apologized.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Critics complained there was not much to the deal.

“Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

After the main deal was approved, tempers flared as the open meeting stretched on. Russia’s ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren’t prepared to share them with everyone.”

An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause.

Key issues at COP30 included efforts to close the gap in ambition of countries’ emission reduction commitments (also known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs); addressing adaptation needs, including funding for lower-income countries working to adapt to rapidly escalating climate impacts; a transition away from fossil fuels toward a clean energy economy, with finance for lower-income countries; and a just transition work program. Recent scientific reports have made clear that the world is currently on track to surpass 1.5 C of global warming and the final outcome of the talks—including the Mutirão political package—is not strong enough to seriously address this reality and protect people and the planet, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. She has been attending the U.N.’s international climate talks and has partnered with the international community on climate and energy policies for about 20 years. Dr. Cleetus attended COP30 in Belém, Brazil.

“The barely adequate outcome salvaged in the final hours of COP30 keeps the Paris Agreement alive but exposes the monumental failures of rich countries—including the United States and European Union nations—to live up to the commitments they made under that agreement.

“Scientists have warned that the world will soon overshoot 1.5 C of global warming. Yet richer countries—who are the largest historical contributors to heat-trapping emissions—continue to gobble up an unfair share of the rapidly dwindling carbon budget left to limit further dangerous climate change. Overshooting 1.5 C also has profound implications for escalating costly and deadly climate impacts, and for loss and damage people across the world are enduring.

“Although a roadmap for a transition away from fossil fuels did not make it into the text, it remains the case that countries already agreed to that transition two years ago in Dubai. In the final plenary, the Presidency made a rousing commitment to initiate a high-level science-based, inclusive process for developing two roadmaps, one on addressing tropical deforestation and one on a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. This important statement is a recognition of the immense support from countries for these urgent priorities, but they must be accompanied by finance and adopted at a future COP. The Presidency will also initiate collaborative processes aimed at improving fulfillment of countries’ emission reduction pledges and raising collective ambition to limit the overshoot of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

“The Mutirão political package includes a nod to tripling adaptation finance, although the overall amount is unclear and will be well short of what’s needed, and the delivery date is punted out to 2035. There is also no firm assurance of public grant-based finance for lower-income nations. People in these countries are reeling from repeated blows from worsening climate impacts, primarily caused by richer nations’ emissions, as evidenced by the recent destruction wrought by back-to-back typhoons in the Philippines and Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean.

“On a positive note, the COP30 outcome includes a very encouraging agreement to develop a just transition mechanism to help enable a fair, funded transformation to a clean energy future with social and economic safeguards for workers and communities. Real-world evidence shows that renewable energy and energy efficiency are winning solutions that help lower energy costs, cut pollution and protect people’s health. Decision-makers at all levels of government and forward-looking businesses should embrace the tremendous opportunity to accelerate global clean energy momentum because it is in everyone’s best interest.

“Despite many wealthy nations claiming to uphold the 1.5 C climate goal and a transition away from fossil fuels, their hypocrisy was on full display here in Belém as they refused to follow through on necessary actions and funding to make those words a reality. Rich nations’ emission reduction commitments are highly insufficient as they continue to be in the thrall of fossil fuels. They have also repeatedly lowballed and shirked delivering desperately needed finance for lower income countries to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and cope with loss and damage. Petrostates—including Saudi Arabia—and fossil fuel lobbyists also played a malign role in blocking ambitious outcomes here at COP.

“COP30 was supposed to be the COP of truth and implementation. Unless nations reckon with the ugly truths revealed here, there will be major repercussions for multilateral climate agreements and more importantly, for the lives of communities who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. People around the world deserve far more from their leaders to meaningfully confront the existential threats brought forth by the climate crisis and advance a thriving, fair clean energy economy. The fight for climate justice does not end here because the fight cannot end here—the stakes are simply too high.”

Energy Vault is a global energy storage technology company that develops large-scale battery systems and innovative gravity-based storage solutions designed to support renewable energy and stabilize electric grids.

Scurry County was selected for its efficient permitting process and strong local workforce, including welders, construction workers, and students from Western Texas College. Officials say the project will help the electric grid better manage demand fluctuations while creating new opportunities for skilled workers in the area.

“There is a desperate need for storage to allow the grid to smooth the peaks and troughs occurring with increasing demand and to account for the much more distributed, smaller generation coming online with wind and solar,” said Joe Smith, Energy Vault Project Manager. “We’re really excited about being here. It’s been fantastic to tap into the skills that already exist in the local job market. We also have plans for further development on this site and across West Texas that will generate more opportunities.”

Energy Vault is developing both conventional battery systems and gravity-based energy storage technology designed to store energy when it is abundant and release it when demand is high. Company leaders say these systems position West Texas at the forefront of energy storage innovation while supporting the region’s growing renewable energy sector.

“The jobs we plan to create as this site grows include electrical work, mechanical work, construction work, welding work, and a wide range of engineering jobs in electrical, mechanical, software, civil, and structural fields,” said Chris Wiese, president of Energy Vault.

The company’s progress in the region builds on the Cross Trails Battery Energy Storage System, the first project Energy Vault has developed, owned, and operated. The system has an output of 57 megawatts and an energy capacity of 114 megawatt hours, and it provides energy and grid support services within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It is also the first installation to use Energy Vault’s second-generation B VAULT AC product.

President Donald Trump’s policies targeting U.S. renewable energy have put two-thirds of Texas’ future solar and battery storage projects at risk of getting stuck in regulatory limbo.

The sector’s leading trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), found that the Trump administration’s stalling of renewable projects through slowing federal permitting and rolling back tax credits could result in more than 13,000 megawatts of planned solar and battery projects — half of all the scheduled projects — might not come online in Texas next year.

In 2027, the share of at-risk capacity jumps to more than 22,500 megawatts of the 26,000 planned. In total, SEIA identified 165 projects in Texas that are at risk of not being built.

The figures are from an analysis of Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. More than 70 gigawatts of solar and 40 gigawatts of battery projects haven’t received all the federal, state and local permits required and are at risk of being slowed down by an administration determined to halt renewable development in favor of fossil fuels.

Some projects in the interconnection queue have lost funding from canceled Solar for All grants and it’s assumed that some projects might not be built due to the loss of tax incentives, said Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter. It’s too early to tell what the broad impact will be, Reed said.

In July, the Trump administration began requiring the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office to sign off on all the agency’s decisions regarding clean energy projects. In its announcement, the Interior Department said it was “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy.”

Later, in September, an agency official said the Interior Department was prioritizing permits for new fossil fuel plants over renewable energy projects because of limited resources and a desire to focus on permitting “reliable” power.

The Interior Department did not respond to questions about how many solar and storage projects were approved by the department since July.

SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper said the administration’s policies are threatening the future of U.S. energy.

“Political attacks on solar and storage are putting half of all power planned to come onto the grid this decade at risk, just as electricity demand from AI is exploding,” Hopper said. “These are projects that would lower costs for families, strengthen our grid and cement America’s global competitiveness.”

While campaigning last year, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills across the country in half within 12 months. A new analysis by Democratic members of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee found that the opposite is happening. Households in nearly every state are on track to pay more for electricity this year than last, upwards of $100. Texas is no exception, the congressional report found.

On average, a Texas household spent $1,960 on electricity last year. This year, they’re projected to pay $2,070, or 5.6 percent more.

Washington, D.C., is projected to have the largest bill increase, up more than 22 percent, followed by Indiana, which the analysis forecasts will see average electricity bills rise more than 16 percent.

The CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operator, credited both solar and storage for bolstering the grid throughout the summer without ever having to make conservation calls despite record-breaking energy demand.

When the state legislature was debating bills earlier this year to restrict the growth of renewables in Texas, the Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club, a trade group, reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage would cost Texans $115 billion in higher wholesale prices over the next 15 years, for both residential and commercial customers within ERCOT.

“Texans know how nonsensical it is for President Trump and Congress to cancel tax incentives for renewables and Solar for All grants so they can spend hundreds of millions to prop up old, polluting coal plants,” Reed said. “Texans deserve to see these projects built, not lost due to federal decisions that are bad for business, bad for bills and bad for our air and water.”

“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release.
“The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored.
Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch.
“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states.","Agricultural groups and environmental groups combined to file a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation alleging the state’s exempt well laws allow unregulated groundwater development outside the state’s permitting system.

According to the DNRC, small groundwater developments that use 35 gallons per minute or less and do not exceed 10 acre-feet per year, are known as “exempt wells.”

There may be as many as 141,000 exempt wells authorized between 1973 and 2023, the lawsuit says.

“By authorizing unregulated groundwater development, the Exempt Well Law undermines these constitutional protections afforded to senior water right appropriators and threatens the integrity of Montana’s water resources,” the lawsuit says.

The coalition bringing the lawsuit against the state is broad, including the Montana League of Cities and Towns, Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators, Clark Fork Coalition, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Farm Bureau Federation, and Trout Unlimited.

A DNRC spokesperson said they could not comment on the suit due to litigation being active.

“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release. “The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored. We’re asking the court to conserve our limited water resources and ensure that the constitutional protections afforded to senior water rights, including instream flow rights, are preserved.”

The lawsuit goes on to say that some of Montana’s fastest growing areas have been “fueled” by individual exempt wells. The issue was heavily discussed during the legislative session, with some home developers and realtor associations pushing to keep rules as they are now.

Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch.

“Exempt wells facilitate a housing development model and pattern that is unsustainable,” Mark Runkle, a Montana housing developer said in a press release. “It transfers many of the developer’s responsibilities to future homeowners and taxpayers. This model undermines responsible development on municipal services with infrastructure completed and undermines the affordability of housing.”

One bill last session — Senate Bill 358 — would have restricted usage of exempt wells in some high-growth areas of the state.

“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states. “Yet, legislative attempts to address the exempt well loophole have been unsuccessful in multiple sessions, including the 2025 session, demonstrating the legislature’s unwillingness or inability to bring the Water Use Act into constitutional compliance.”

The suit seeks to end the exempt well “loophole.”

“The exempt well loophole forces cities and towns to shoulder the consequences of unregulated groundwater use,” Kelly Lynch, executive director of Montana League of Cities and Towns, said in a press release. “Municipalities are already struggling to ensure reliable water supplies for growing communities. We need a consistent, lawful permitting process that protects existing users, not a system that leaves Montana’s communities and taxpayers to clean up the mess.”

First Solar is continuing to take major steps in that direction with its new $330 million investment in South Carolina, where a manufacturing plant is slated to begin operations in 2026 and create more than 600 local jobs. The facility will handle the final production stages of the company’s thin-film modules, reinforcing the role

American manufacturing plays in long-term energy competitiveness.

At the same time, First Solar is also opening a 2.4-million-square-foot facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana—the largest single investment in the parish’s history. Once fully operational, the plant will employ more than 700 people and produce solar modules built with American-made components. This expansion strengthens domestic supply chains, boosts the regional economy, and brings more of the solar manufacturing process onto U.S. soil at a moment when global competition is intensifying.

These investments are just one major component of the United States still racing to secure the clean-energy supply chains that will define the future. We already know international competitors—especially China—are moving quickly. Maintaining American energy leadership requires supporting domestic manufacturing, high-quality American jobs, and local clean-energy projects that anchor economic security at home. Expanding this kind of homegrown industrial capacity is how the U.S. ensures the next generation of energy technology is built for, and by, the American people.

The battery energy storage industry is advancing quickly, and real-world projects across the country are showing how these systems can strengthen the grid while saving money for consumers. In Chattanooga, the local municipal utility deployed a 2.5 MW / 10 MWh battery that kept nearly 400 customers powered for half an hour after a distribution line unexpectedly went offline. The incident offered a clear demonstration of how storage can act as a frontline resilience

tool, keeping the lights on even when traditional infrastructure experiences an interruption.

Virginia is experiencing similar momentum. Danville Utilities’ first battery system, a 10.5 MW project developed with Lightshift Energy, has already improved local grid stability and is projected to save residents roughly $40 million over the next two decades. A second Danville project is expected to expand peak-shaving benefits by discharging power during the most expensive hours of the day. Other communities, including Spotsylvania County and Smyth County, are moving forward with their own battery

installations designed to support grid reliability and reduce long-term energy costs.

Taken together, these projects reflect a broader national trend. Battery storage has become a practical and cost-effective tool for improving reliability, managing peak demand, and strengthening America’s overall energy security. Even when a line goes down, storage can help ensure that homes and businesses stay powered. As energy needs grow nationwide, expanding the use of battery storage will play a central role in delivering a more resilient and affordable energy future.",https://energyrightus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ER-Logo-1.svg,N,,2025-11-22 16:00:21.286052

Local businesses generate sales tax revenue and contribute significantly to property taxes.
Every dollar spent locally is a brick in the foundation of a stronger school system — just ask Calcasieu Superintendent Jason VanMetre.

“When you spend at an independent local business, far more of each dollar stays here and gets re-spent on local wages, local suppliers, and local taxes that fund our schools, roads, and first responders.","When one shops locally, a significant portion of that money stays right here in Southwest Louisiana, creating a powerful ripple effect that benefits everyone — especially the school system.

In the heart of Southwest Louisiana, a thriving local business community and well-funded school system go hand in hand. Local businesses generate sales tax revenue and contribute significantly to property taxes. Calcasieu Parish’s local government, in turn, allocates a large portion of these funds directly to the school district.

Every dollar spent locally is a brick in the foundation of a stronger school system — just ask Calcasieu Superintendent Jason VanMetre.

“The Calcasieu Parish School Board budget is heavily reliant on sales tax revenue,” he said. “As residents of the area shop locally, they directly impact the sales tax revenue that we receive at CPSB.”

VanMetre said without these local revenues, the board “would not be able to provide the services that we do for our students or compensate our employees. Shopping at a local business means something — especially this time of year.”

VanMetre said a healthier, more engaged community — supported by local businesses — does wonders for student well-being and enrollment.

“As our community grows, so do our students and schools,” he said. “We as a school board are a direct reflection of our community. We strive every day to create an environment that grows our students and helps to provide productive citizens for the future of our community. We are continuing to grow and we are proud of that. A healthy community, supported by local residents, means that everyone continues to grow: our businesses, our services that we can provide and our schools.”

Local businesses also contribute to student success through things like internships, mentoring and guest-speaking opportunities.

“We have businesses every day that assist us in growing our students,” VanMetre said. “From mentoring, to tutoring, to speaking on our campuses our local businesses provide a wide range of support for our schools.”

In turn, VanMetre said, the school board has been able to provide assistance to other agencies or businesses through having students assist with volunteer opportunities.

“This builds our students’ character through service and interaction with the public,” he said. “Part of creating a well-rounded student is showing them that they are part of a larger community and that in Calcasieu, that community is vibrant.”

VanMetre said local businesses have been true partners in educating Southwest Louisiana students.

“Our schools are a part of our community,” he said. “This is evident from the number of businesses that have served as Partners in Education, or donate to sports teams, events or other activities. We are so fortunate to have these businesses as true partners in educating our students.”

VanMetre said in some cases, businesses have had relationships with local schools for decades.

“This shows how important the relationship is to, not only the school, but also the business,” he said. “Everyone in Calcasieu wants to work together to ensure that our future is bright. And it definitely is thanks to the wonderful and long-standing relationships we have with our community. I can’t say thank you enough.”

Beyond the school system Cheryl Duhon, Vice President and Senior Financial Advisor of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management on Country Club Road, said multiplier effect of local spending translates into tangible financial benefits for the entire community.

“I see the local multiplier effect every day with the families I serve,” Duhon said. “When you spend at an independent local business, far more of each dollar stays here and gets re-spent on local wages, local suppliers, and local taxes that fund our schools, roads, and first responders. That creates stronger job security, rising property values, and a healthier economy that makes it easier for everyone in our community to grow and protect their wealth right here at home.”

From a wealth management perspective, Duhon said an individual can quantify the return on investment of shopping locally versus potentially saving a few dollars at a major retailer by thinking of it as a total lifetime return instead of just today’s price tag.

“Choosing to spend locally — even if it costs a few dollars more — helps keep jobs and opportunity in our community, which in turn supports home values and the income most families depend on,” she said. “Over time, the benefit of living in a strong, vibrant community almost always outweighs the small savings from shopping at a national chain.”

Supporting business also can align with an individual’s long-term financial goals — such as retirement planning, saving for education, or building an emergency fund.

“Your everyday spending choices have a real impact on your long-term goals,” Duhon said. “When local businesses thrive, our community enjoys greater job stability and rising real estate values, two of the biggest factors that help families stay on track with retirement savings, college funding, and emergency reserves. The clients I work with who intentionally shop local are, in a very real way, helping protect the same future they are planning for.”

Community investing can also be a healthy part of a diversified portfolio.

“One of the most meaningful ways to invest in our community is to work with a local wealth advisor who lives here and truly understands the lives we lead,” Duhon said. “At Merrill here in town, my clienwts get the advantage of global resources paired with the personal attention of someone who is part of this same community. That combination often leads to retirement strategies, legacy plans, and investment portfolios that feel more connected to the goals and values that matter most to them right here at home.”",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/11/Shop-local.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 13:59:34.660754

In the following months, the rare earth recycling strategy led by US companies gradually became clearer and more established.
This policy direction provides clear market expectations and development momentum for European rare earth recycling enterprises.
Rare earth recycling technology continues to advance, evolving from traditional hydrometallurgy toward more efficient and environmentally friendly methods.
Coupled with various variables such as international politics, the rare earth recycling industry may seem distant and elusive.","Against the backdrop of the current US-China rivalry, China's export control policies on rare earths have prompted Western countries to deeply recognize the strategic importance of rare earth elements. To reduce their reliance on China, the West is actively attempting to build a complete rare earth industry chain, from mining to magnet manufacturing. However, the development cycle for rare earth resources is lengthy, and China holds an absolute technological advantage and economies of scale in rare earth mining, separation, and smelting. This makes it extremely difficult for the West to achieve breakthroughs in the industry chain in the short term, unable to meet their urgent immediate needs.

Confronted with this dilemma, Western enterprises and governments are channeling more resources into the field of rare earth recycling, viewing it as a crucial pathway to alleviate short-term supply pressures and enhance supply chain resilience. Several companies have begun deploying strategies to recover rare earth elements from waste materials such as discarded electronic products and industrial magnets, attempting to compensate for the shortfall in raw material supply through a circular economy model.

Recently, recycling companies including the US-based HyProMag, Australia's IonicRE, and Canada's Cyclic Materials have entered into new raw material supply and technical cooperation agreements with industry chain partners, driving the transition of rare earth recycling from pilot projects to commercial scale.

These collaborations cover multiple stages, from scrap collection and technical processing to high-end magnet production, aiming to significantly increase the rare earth recovery rate from the current level of less than 1%.

In June, a US-India joint venture launched a magnet recycling project aimed at improving the efficiency of ReElement chromatographic separation technology. The project is expected to process 2,000 metric tons per year of retired magnets from electric vehicles and wind power equipment, with a projected recovery rate of up to 90%.

In the following months, the rare earth recycling strategy led by US companies gradually became clearer and more established. HyProMag expanded the scope of its raw material agreements to include new sources such as electric motors and wind turbine rotors. The company formed a joint team with electronics recycler ILS to accelerate procurement progress at its Fort Worth, Texas plant. Over its 40-year operational period, the plant plans to recycle 750 metric tons of sintered NdFeB magnets and 807 metric tons of NdFeB by-products annually. HyProMag also plans to expand its operations to Nevada and South Carolina using a hub-and-spoke model, aiming to triple its recycling capacity. Australia's IonicRE has signed an agreement with US Strategic Metals (USSM) to produce rare earth oxides using recycled magnets. IonicRE will provide recycling technology through its UK subsidiary Ionic Technologies to produce Pr-Nd oxide and heavy rare earth elements (dysprosium, terbium, samarium, gadolinium, and holmium) with a purity exceeding 99.5%.

Canada's Cyclic Materials has entered into an exclusive ten-year agreement with German magnet producer VAC to specifically handle magnet production scrap from VAC's new plant in Sumter, South Carolina.

Cyclic Materials expects its recycling process to reduce carbon emissions by 75% compared to raw ore mining. The company is constructing a facility in Mesa, Arizona, with an annual processing capacity of 25,000 mt of scrap magnets, which is expected to commence operations in early 2026. Rare earth supply security has become a strategic priority for the US and European countries.

The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act requires that 15% of the EU's rare earth capacity be achieved through recycling by 2030. This policy direction provides clear market expectations and development momentum for European rare earth recycling enterprises.

The US is actively promoting the development of the rare earth recycling industry, primarily motivated by the desire to reduce dependence on rare earths from a single country, establish a multi-channel rare earth supply landscape, and safeguard the expansion of key industries such as military applications.

A rare earth recycling plant, jointly established by France and Japan in Lacq, France, is expected to produce 800 mt of light rare earths and 600 mt of heavy rare earths annually upon commissioning, accounting for approximately 15% of global production. This output will meet about 20% of Japan's future demand for dysprosium and terbium.

Rare earth recycling technology continues to advance, evolving from traditional hydrometallurgy toward more efficient and environmentally friendly methods. The EU's ""nano-droplet emulsion separation"" technology requires only hundreds of purification steps and achieves 95% selectivity. The HyProMag project, a collaboration between the UK and Germany, uses hydrogen processing technology to recover NdFeB magnets from electronic waste with a purity exceeding 99%. Meanwhile, industrial collaboration models for rare earth recycling are also being innovated.

The cooperation between Cyclic and VAC has established a closed-loop model of ""production-recycling-reproduction."" This partnership not only addresses the issue of scrap treatment but also provides a stable source of raw materials for new magnet production, reducing risks across the entire supply chain. The sustainable procurement requirements for rare earth magnets from end-users such as automakers like General Motors have further driven the development of the recycling industry. VAC's Sumter plant will prioritize supplying magnets for multiple EV models of General Motors over the next decade, and such long-term collaborations ensure demand stability for the recycling industry.

Currently, overseas rare earth recycling, much like mining at the ore end, is still in the early stages of technological research and exploration, with commercial operations still a long way off. Coupled with various variables such as international politics, the rare earth recycling industry may seem distant and elusive. However, as global industrial technology continues to advance, rare earth recycling will gradually move forward.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-11-22 13:59:25.251212

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as reported by Energies Media, developers added an impressive 12 gigawatts of new utility-scale solar capacity in the first half of 2025, with plans to add another 21 GW by year's end.

If all projects go online, it will mark a record year for U.S. clean energy growth, driven by continued investment in solar and battery storage systems.

Texas, long known for oil and gas, now leads the nation in solar power, adding roughly 27% of all new solar capacity this year. That milestone highlights a dramatic shift in the U.S. energy landscape, one that's delivering lower costs and cleaner air for millions of Americans.

The expansion of solar and storage benefits the environment and people's wallets. Homeowners have seen their energy bills cut by up to 60% after installing solar panels.

Aside from personal savings, renewable power projects can reduce dependence on imported fuels and create thousands of good-paying jobs. As more states embrace these clean energy investments, communities are reaping long-term benefits.

Meanwhile, aging coal-fired plants are being retired or canceled in increasing numbers. More than 3.6 GW of planned coal capacity has been delayed or scrapped so far this year, as utility providers turn to cheaper, more efficient solar and wind alternatives.

""Solar and storage are the backbone of America's energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,"" said Solar Energy Industries Association President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper, per Energies Media.

Solar adoption has already proved to drastically reduce household electricity bills while cutting harmful air pollution. Installing solar panels at home is one of the most effective ways to shrink your monthly energy costs, sometimes down to $0.

EnergySage offers a free, easy-to-use tool that lets homeowners compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on installation.

Yet Kia’s executives are striking a different tone than they have for the past few years. At last year’s LA Auto Show, the company was unveiling the new, U.S.-built versions of the EV6 and a high-performance GT trim for the EV9. I thought at the time that a Tesla-style charging plug, eligibility for the federal tax credit and a new U.S. production location would sweeten the deal significantly.

But one year later, the tax credit is gone, the EV9 GT is postponed indefinitely, and the EV6 is, seemingly, the one EV that didn’t set a sales record in the second quarter, even as buyers rushed to claim tax credits. And as a South Korean company, Kia has been vulnerable to new tariffs. The car market is now very different from what it was a year ago.

But Kia’s competency in all three powertrain types means that it can lean into “choice,” executives said.

“We’re not pushing anything. We’re creating the right products that are meeting the customer demands,” Russell Wager, Kia’s vice president of marketing in the U.S., told InsideEVs.

Gallery: 2027 Kia Telluride

It’s a fair and earned brag. The Telluride was a smash hit for the company, breaking through to a wealthy and young audience with a ravenous appetite for three-row SUVs. At the LA Auto Show, Kia revealed a second-generation Telluride with a new hybrid powertrain. It sits well alongside the EV9, which just set its own sales record, and models like the Carnival and K5, which just saw 48% and 85% sales growth, respectively. (All of these numbers are from the third quarter.)

“We just got done with a national dealer meeting in Las Vegas,” Wager said. “We had over 1,700 representatives from our dealers there, and we told them: ‘we are going to give you choices for your customers.’”

Reality Check

This year, then, has been a reality check for Kia, as it has for everyone. With the EV tax credits gone and the Trump administration ending any sort of fuel economy regulations pushing for cleaner cars, a lot is up in the air right now. And that makes Kia’s onetime EV push less of a certainty than before.

“Yeah, I think the EV business has been, I would say, disrupted,” Eric Watson, Kia’s vice president of sales operations for the U.S., said in an interview.

”We had a great start to the year, and then in summer, there was a lot of EV business pulled ahead,” he said, referencing how buyers moved up their purchase timelines to take advantage of tax-credit deals, which expired on Sept. 30.

The Kia EV9 set a sales record in the third quarter.

Since then, the industry “softened,” but Watson says he expects EV sales to bounce back slightly from their October nadir. Sales peaked at around 10% of the market, then dropped to around 4-5% now, he said.

“But in 2026 it'll grow. I think it'll get to six, seven or eight percent of the industry next year,” Watson told me. Even in a best-case scenario, then, we’re probably not going to see 10% penetration anytime in the next year. And as Kia proves better than maybe any other company, it’s not for a lack of trying.

The company was early to launch a compelling compact electric SUV. This segment makes up the meat of the EV market, and Kia arrived with industry-beating charging times, an 800-volt architecture, plenty of range and good pricing. It was an immediate hit. But that was in 2021, in a much less crowded field. Since then, Kia has introduced the fantastic EV9—which nearly clinched our Breakthrough EV Of The Year award in 2024—and promised more affordable options, like the upcoming EV3. (The company hasn’t yet said when that might come to the U.S. market.) Its sibling, the EV4 sedan that was shown off to much fanfare at the New York Auto Show this spring, has been postponed “indefinitely.”

The Kia EV3 is supposed to come to the U.S. at some point in the near future.

But consumers are clamoring for hybrids, and the tax credit is gone. Tariffs are in effect, and steep duties have been biting into Kia’s margins since April. A recent tariff deal with South Korea lessens the pain, but it’s still far more expensive to import EVs than it was a year ago. Then consider that emissions standards are getting rolled back, and that Kia buyers can’t seem to get enough high-trim, high-dollar Tellurides.

All of this adds up to a refocused version of Kia that is aggressively playing the spread. The company is aggressively launching new hybrid versions of its core lineup, while pushing into new markets with upscale EVs like the top-trim EV9.

The Kia EV4 was supposed to come to the U.S., but has been postponed indefinitely.

The only thing it really needs is an affordable electric option, a role that should be filled by the upcoming EV3. But we still don’t know where that’ll be built, how much it’ll cost, how interested consumers will be, or whether we can expect other affordable options to follow.

“Things are changing, right? We're cognizant of the fact that we moved some production here for EV9 and EV6. So that gives us flexibility,” Wager, the marketing boss, said. “We're looking at: Should we bring others to North America?

Wager noted that the company has a “global portfolio” of products, including many EVs that haven’t made it here yet. But the business case for them—and any future EV, for that matter—is unclear in such a noisy, chaotic environment.

“So we're just waiting to see where things shake out a little bit, but we'll add to the lineup,” Wager said. “We’re just figuring out the timing.”

On Wednesday, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.
If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.
“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School.
Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Mr. Trump, has promised to block any new drilling.","The environmental rollbacks came one after the next this week, potentially affecting everything from the survival of rare whales to the health of the Hudson River.

On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, narrowing the reach of the Clean Water Act.

On Wednesday, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.

And on Thursday, the Interior Department moved to allow new oil and gas drilling across nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, including a remote region in the high Arctic where drilling has never before taken place.

If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.

“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

The quick pace of these proposals was notable, even for an administration that has enacted Mr. Trump’s agenda at breakneck speed.

While the administration was working in Washington to dismantle environmental protections, 3,300 miles to the south, negotiators from nearly 200 nations were trying to improve the planet’s health at the United Nations climate summit in Brazil.

“The Trump administration unveiled many historic announcements this week to further President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email. “President Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.”

A range of industries supported the changes, including groups representing farmers, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, home builders and real estate developers.

“The developments this week were definitely major steps toward the administration’s goal of achieving and restoring American energy dominance and manufacturing dominance as well,” said Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. “We’re definitely very pleased with what came out.”

The E.P.A. kicked off the wave of deregulation on Monday, when it proposed to significantly scale back the Clean Water Act, which Congress passed in 1972 to protect all “waters of the United States” from pollution or destruction.

The agency said it would more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said the changes would prevent people with the smallest of waterways on their properties from needing to obtain federal permits if they wanted to fill them in or dump pollutants. “Farmers, ranchers and landowners shouldn’t have every puddle or gully regulated by D.C. bureaucrats,” she said in a statement.

The deregulatory spree picked up on Wednesday, when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service announced changes to the way the Endangered Species Act, the bedrock environmental law intended to prevent animal and plant extinctions, is applied.

The proposals would allow the government to assess economic factors, such as lost revenue from a ban on oil drilling near critical habitat, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered. At the moment, the government considers only the best available science when awarding that designation, which triggers protections against killing or harming the species and interfering with its habitat.

It was easy to miss the announcement about endangered species, which came on the same day that Mr. Trump signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to make public its files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the move was worth attention, said Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School.

“It’s really hard for the public to keep track of this news, but it’s really important that they do,” Mr. Mergen said. “We’re going to lose species and their habitats in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way, but there are things that can be done to right the ship and help these species recover.”

On Thursday, as the news cycle was dominated by Mr. Trump’s insult of a journalist, the Interior Department announced a plan to hold as many as 34 sales of leases in federal waters spanning roughly 1.27 billion acres, an area more than half the size of the United States.

The plan would require six sales of leases off the coast of California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Mr. Trump, has promised to block any new drilling. It also would mandate seven auctions of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, which Mr. Trump calls the Gulf of America, and 21 auctions of leases off the coast of Alaska, including in an isolated region called the high Arctic stretching more than 200 miles offshore.

Instead, oil industry interest could be concentrated in the Gulf, where drilling rigs are already plentiful. “The Gulf has the infrastructure, work force and expertise that make it uniquely productive,” said Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents offshore drilling companies as well as offshore wind firms.

Yet the critically endangered Rice’s whale lives only in the Gulf, and scientists worry that drilling there could drive the species to extinction. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil, caused the Rice’s whale population to decline by an estimated 22 percent. Fewer than 100 of the animals are thought to remain.

“For Rice’s whales, drilling and blasting for oil and gas is truly an existential threat,” said Michael Jasny, who oversees marine mammal protection at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

When blocking offshore wind farms, Mr. Trump has repeatedly invoked the welfare of whales, claiming that “wind mills are driving the whales crazy.” There is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and in fact, the noisy seismic surveys used in oil and gas exploration can stress whales to the point of harming their health, said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the executive director for North America at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a wildlife charity.

Ultimately, it could take the administration up to two years to finalize the proposals unveiled this week. At that point, environmental groups and other opponents could challenge the rules in court, leading to lengthy legal battles.

But Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, told reporters on Monday that his goal was to write regulations that would be “durable and withstand future swings of presidential elections to come.” He also suggested that 2025 would set a record in terms of environmental rollbacks.

“It’s possible that at least half of the president’s deregulatory agenda is at our agency, at E.P.A.,” Mr. Zeldin told the conservative entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David on Thursday on the “The PBD Podcast.” “We will do more deregulation in one year than entire federal governments in the past have done across all federal agencies combined.”

To try to reach compliance, Colorado mandated emissions-reduction rules on sectors from oil-and-gas to industrial facilities to commercial buildings in recent years, and gas stations in the nonattainment area began selling higher-priced reformulated gas last summer.
VOC emissions have fallen from 491.2 tons per day to 236.5, and NOx emissions dropped from 275.5 tons per day to 142.7.
What’s in the State Implementation Plan Instead, they updated the SIP by taking several emissions-cutting steps that were agreed to by all parties.
“This rulemaking is not designed to get Colorado into compliance,” lamented Lindsay Ex, policy director for Colorado Communities for Climate Action.","Seeing no pathway to reach compliance with federal ozone standards by 2027, Colorado regulators voluntarily downgraded the state’s status with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday — a move that will buy them more time to try and reduce air pollution.

In doing so, however, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission resisted efforts from the business community to seek a federal designation that would have eased some restrictions, as well as efforts from environmentalists to add regulations on oil and gas. And while the final State Implementation Plan that the AQCC passed unanimously is hardly a stay-the-course roadmap — it seeks to reduce ozone precursors from drilling wells 50% by 2030 — it also acknowledged improvements that have come from existing regulations.

“Maybe we haven’t made as much progress as we’d like,” commissioner Curtis Rueter said shortly before passage of the updated SIP. “But at the same time, we’ve made some tremendous progress on several fronts.”

A large swath of the Front Range has been out of compliance since 2012 with EPA standards requiring ozone concentrations below 75 parts per billion, and a larger section extending to the Wyoming border is noncompliant with a new 70-parts-per-billion standard. To try to reach compliance, Colorado mandated emissions-reduction rules on sectors from oil-and-gas to industrial facilities to commercial buildings in recent years, and gas stations in the nonattainment area began selling higher-priced reformulated gas last summer.

Ozone precursors falling

The strategies have produced some success stories. Emissions of nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds — the precursors to ozone — are down nearly 50% since 2011, explained Jessica Ferko, planning and policy program manager for the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division. VOC emissions have fallen from 491.2 tons per day to 236.5, and NOx emissions dropped from 275.5 tons per day to 142.7.

But ozone levels remain stubbornly close to 77 parts per billion, leading to health problems including pulmonary conditions and exacerbation of afflictions like asthma, explained Mike Silverstein, executive director of the Regional Air Quality Control Council. Though locally man-made ozone represents the minority of those parts, with most of the pollution coming from national and international sources or from natural causes like wildfires, Colorado still must work to reduce emissions from drills, cars and a lot of other sources.

With no viable path to cut ozone enough to avoid the whole northern Front Range being downgraded from serious to severe noncompliance by 2027, APCD officials chose instead to voluntarily downgrade the state, delaying its next compliance requirements until 2032. This will allow emissions-reduction strategies to fully mature and show more impact, Ferko told the AQCC during a two-day hearing, and it removes the need for the state to do extensive modeling immediately and propose unrealistic compliance pathways.

Several groups, including the Colorado Chamber of Commerce and Colorado Oil & Gas Association, urged the state to file a 179B designation seeking exemption from downgrade by arguing the Front Range would be in compliance if not for international emissions. Ferko agreed to brief the AQCC more on that potential process at a future date, but commissioners said they didn’t have enough information yet to take that step forward.

What’s in the State Implementation Plan

Instead, they updated the SIP by taking several emissions-cutting steps that were agreed to by all parties. Those included new regulations on certain aerospace coatings and the continuation through 2030 of a two-year-old NOx emissions-intensity-reduction program that is set to cut emissions of those compounds 50% by 2030 as compared to 2017 levels.

The Local Government Coalition — a 47-member organization representing areas like Adams, Boulder and Broomfield counties — asked the AQCC to go further and set mass-based limits on upstream oil-and-gas emissions, essentially capping production. This was needed, officials from that group said, because if oil and gas production grows in the next five years, it could boost rather than reduce the amount of emissions from that sector if drillers are required only to lower their emissions intensity.

“This rulemaking is not designed to get Colorado into compliance,” lamented Lindsay Ex, policy director for Colorado Communities for Climate Action. “More solutions and more strategies are needed.”

Ferko argued, however, that the reduction in NOx and VOCs shows that the emissions-intensity cutbacks are leading to overall emissions reductions and that mass-based limits would neither be helpful nor easily enforceable. If the sector did not reach its limit, she asked, who exactly would be responsible for making further mandatory cuts?

“The emissions inventory has been vetted by a lot of people. I’m confident it will result in mass reductions as well,” said commissioner Gregg Thomas before AQCC members voted unanimously against the LGC’s request.

A debate over minor modifications

Beyond that issue, there were a few specific provisions in the SIP that triggered significant debate during the hearing.

APCD staffers, for example, wanted to change the current permitting process for minor modifications — facility upgrades at major-emitter sites that are designed to allow greater production and could result in small increases of NOx or VOC emissions. Companies applying for minor-modification permits now can proceed with work immediately under state rules, but division leaders wanted to require that some of these projects instead go through a period of public notice and public comment.

Leah Martland, supervisor for APCD’s planning and policy regulatory team, noted that the division signed an informal agreement with the EPA in January to get more public comment on minor modification procedures. And commissioner Jana Milford said she believed it was important to take that step to show that the AQCC wants to hear input from communities like Commerce City that are near high-emitting industrial sites and be transparent about what regulators are allowing.

Colorado Chamber regulatory affairs advisor Dave Kulmann argued, however, that requiring even minor changes to go through the division’s lengthy, backlogged construction-permitting process could turn a four-month project into one that takes two years. And Carlos Romo, an attorney representing the Colorado Petroleum Association, said the change would make Colorado the first state to require public notice for minor modifications — all because of a non-binding resolution with the EPA.

“This is one of the few instances where we actually have a semi-streamlined permitting process in the division. Please don’t take that away,” Kulmann pled with commissioners before they voted 6-3 not to change the minor-modification process.

Emissions reduction credits

Commissioners OK’d an APCD plan to modernize the issuance of emissions reduction credits, a currently rarely-used process in which emitters can take voluntary actions like shutting down a producing well and get credits to help them meet their emissions limits. And they agreed to not foreclose the potential of offering those credits for mobile-source emissions cuts for actions like vehicle electrification in the future if those sources are ever subject to review permitting — an action that frustrated some environmentalists.

However, the commission did not go as far as groups like COGA and the American Petroleum Institute Colorado had asked them to in directing that actions like well shutdowns be awarded such credits automatically. Martland argued successfully that the credits must be considered on a case-by-case basis and can’t be given automatically if a company were to shut down one well while increasing emissions from other equipment.

Commissioners avoided having much discussion on the Blueprint submitted by the RAQC that recommends consideration of a host of future regulations or best practices on a wide range of sectors in order to achieve greater emissions reductions. The document garnered attention particularly for its suggestions to consider regulations on indirect sources of emissions that attract significant vehicle traffic, from airports to warehouses to sporting arenas, by trying to limit the traffic of gas-powered vehicles to them.

More suggestions for reducing ozone to come

While the LGC emphasized that it endorsed all the suggestions in the Blueprint, Silverstein said his group was submitting the proposal not for inclusion in the SIP but to spur ideas about further ways that the AQCC could look to get to compliance. He asked only that the RAQC be allowed to come back and brief the commission on potential benefits to the strategies as it undertook further study on their efficacy.

“Our job is to send you plans to reach attainment with federal standards,” said Dan Kramer, the Estes Park town attorney who chairs the RAQC board. “Some of what we propose may be expensive to implement, but there is nothing we don’t expect to pay off, especially in the health of our communities.”

While business leaders generally expressed satisfaction with the updated SIP — attorneys for COGA and API noted particularly how they support the approved plan to reduce NOx and VOC emissions further by 2030 — AQCC members expressed mixed feelings.

Will updates help public health?

Milford, for example, voiced disappointment that the state must take a compliance downgrade and defer federal judgment on its emissions-cutting efforts until 2032. But she, like APCD officials, said that the state can’t take its foot off the gas and must look for emissions reductions that will have more substantial impacts on air quality.

“In the end, what we’re doing is we spend a lot of time with these procedures, and really, we very seldom use the word ‘public health,’” commissioner Jon Slutsky said. “I wish we could do it a little sooner.”

But Chris Colclasure, a COGA attorney, emphasized any high-cost regulations imposed by the AQCC that couldn’t account for substantial-enough reductions to reach compliance would only impose burdens on Colorado businesses without producing progress. And he pointed to the substantial NOx and VOC cuts the state already has made and said that feasible steps will continue to reduce that pollution, even if cutting ozone is harder — a sentiment that seemed to land with at least one commissioner.

“We’ve made some great progress as a region in terms of precursors. The fact that ozone response is not there is very frustrating,” Thomas said.",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-gas-wells-Parachute-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 11:05:12.536765

It enables the deployment of DC fast-charging infrastructure without worrying about hardware, software (including updates), maintenance, or station visibility in navigation systems. Tesla takes care of everything (at an undisclosed cost), while the independent owner retains complete control over the site (including branding the dispensers, pricing, etc.).

This bloc includes Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates, and some countries dependent on using fossil fuels.
If so, it will bitterly disappoint those calling for stronger language on fossil fuels and the need to limit global temperatures.
Failure to reach an agreement on a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels would not only be a big win for petrostates, but also for Trump and his hard-right allies.
“The Pacific came to Cop30 demanding a survival roadmap away from fossil fuels.","Climate crisis talks look likely to stretch well into the weekend in Brazil, with countries still far apart on the crucial issues of phasing out fossil fuels and cutting carbon.

The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, urged ministers and high-ranking officials from more than 190 countries to find common ground: “We need to preserve this regime [of the Paris climate agreement] with the spirit of cooperation, not in the spirit of who is going to win or is willing to lose’” he said. “Because we know if we don’t strengthen this, everyone will lose.”

No agreement looked likely, however, on the core issue of a “transition away from fossil fuels”, with the conference split into two large blocs.

More than 80 developed and developing countries have called for the process of drawing up a roadmap for the transition to begin, which would allow all governments to pursue self-chosen measures and timetables towards the eventual goal.

Even this – derided by some civil society groups as too weak – was unacceptable to a separate group of more than 80 countries, according to Corrêa do Lago. This bloc includes Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates, and some countries dependent on using fossil fuels. References to a roadmap were excised from a draft text published early on Friday morning at their insistence.

Corrêa do Lago told the Guardian on Friday: “This issue has grown in importance. But more than 80 countries have said it is a non-starter. My president has said it is a priority. But we will see, as many countries have clearly said that they do not want this at the moment.”

A fresh draft text was expected late on Friday night or early on Saturday morning in Brazil, but several people involved in the talks said it might have only minor tweaks.

If so, it will bitterly disappoint those calling for stronger language on fossil fuels and the need to limit global temperatures. One developed country said: “The Brazilians are only listening to the Arab group.”

Brazil convened ministerial discussions among all of the major regional and interest groups at the talks on Friday afternoon, as well as holding meetings with individual countries after a morning plenary meeting with all countries was inconclusive.

The European commissioner for climate, Wopke Hoekstra, said the deal on offer was so inadequate that countries may leave with no agreement.

“What is now on the table is unacceptable,” he said. “And given that we’re so far away from where we should be, it’s unfortunate to say, but we’re really facing a no-deal scenario.”

Bas Eickhout, a member of the European parliament’s delegation to Cop30, said: “With this text as it stands, no deal is better than a bad deal. Failure to reach an agreement on a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels would not only be a big win for petrostates, but also for Trump and his hard-right allies.

“No one can seriously expect us to win the fight on the climate crisis if we don’t deal with the elephant in the room: phasing out fossil fuels.”

In a sign of the slow pace of progress, Colombia and the Netherlands announced they would hold a separate but complementary conference on the transition away from fossil fuels for high-ambition countries next year.

“We have taken this step because, simply, we cannot wait any longer,” said Tuvalu’s environment minister, Maina Talia. “The Pacific came to Cop30 demanding a survival roadmap away from fossil fuels. Yet this text does not even name the threat to our existence. This process is failing us so we will not wait.”

The climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, Tina Stege, said: “As a nation that is just two metres above sea level we know that climate action cannot wait. This roadmap is inevitable, it’s happening.”

The Guardian understands from various countries’ delegates that China is not among the countries blocking a roadmap, while India has taken a harder line by insisting developed countries bear responsibility for past greenhouse gas emissions.

A few developing countries with fossil fuel interests, including Nigeria and Sierra Leone, have backed a potential roadmap.

Also at stake is the question of how countries respond to the fact that current national climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions, would lead to about 2.5C of heating above preindustrial levels, far above the 1.5C limit target set by the Paris agreement.

One delegate from the Alliance of Small Island States said issue was critical to vulnerable countries, but the draft text contained only options to continue talking about the large gap between countries’ targets and the carbon cuts necessary to stay within 1.5C or as close to it as is now possible.

Tesla Inc. introduced new versions of its top-selling models priced at under $40,000, making its main vehicles more affordable to counteract the loss of US incentives for electric cars.

The new standard versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle start at $36,990 and $39,990, Tesla’s website shows. Those starting prices are about 13% and 11% cheaper, respectively, than premium longer-range versions of each model.

Tesla has been building anticipation for more affordable vehicles since early last year, when some investors and company insiders were alarmed by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s decision to de-emphasize a roughly $25,000 model. The CEO has instead prioritized efforts to develop self-driving technology and humanoid robots.

“The cars are increasingly just the cash engine for Tesla’s real pivot: autonomy and robotics,” said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities.

Executives said during Tesla’s most recent earnings call that while the company started building a more affordable model in June, they opted to put off production until after the US phased out up to $7,500 federal tax credits. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja cautioned that output will ramp up slower than initially anticipated.

Tesla’s new models offer less battery range and are stripped of features including ambient interior lighting and a second-row screen.

While Tesla is coming off a record quarter of vehicle deliveries, its global sales have fallen around 6% year-to-date. Demand for EVs in its largest market is expected to drop off after the US eliminated incentives.

Analysts at BloombergNEF expect US sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models to drop to around 332,000 vehicles in the final three months of the year, from almost 500,000 units in the third quarter.

“The stock baked in too much excitement for this as a driver of sales,” Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Financial, said of Tesla’s new Model Y. “Days like this remind investors the headwinds their core business faces, regardless of the longer-term dream premium that drives the stock.”

The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is willing to support the laws if Labor agrees to gut environment protections and strip back the powers of its proposed environment protection agency (EPA).
As of Friday afternoon, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, and the shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, were still waiting for Labor’s options for a potential deal.
Hanson-Young on Friday reiterated that the Greens wouldn’t support the legislation without extra protections for forests and the climate.
“What plays on my mind is not allowing this government off the hook when they’re pushing for laws that will fast-track coal and gas,” she said.","Labor would prevent a contentious “national interest” exemption being used to approve coal and gas projects if the Greens agreed to support its nature laws, Guardian Australia can reveal.

The offer follows a groundswell of criticism about the discretionary power, including from the author of the review that inspired the new laws, Graeme Samuel, and the former treasury secretary Ken Henry.

The concession alone may not be enough to win over the Greens, who demand protections for native forests and consideration of the climate impacts of projects in exchange for backing the proposed overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.

With the government desperate to pass the laws in parliament’s final sitting of the year, the environment minister, Murray Watt, is locked in negotiations with the Greens and the Coalition in the hope of landing a deal next week.

Neither side supports the bill in its current form, putting the onus on Labor to cough up concessions if it wants to avoid the long-awaited reform collapsing for the second time in 12 months.

A senior government source confirmed to Guardian Australia that, under a potential deal with the Greens, it would rewrite the proposed “national interest” test to prevent it being used to approve fossil fuel projects.

Critical minerals projects could still be approved.

Under the provision, which Samuel initially supported in his 2020 review of the EPBC Act as a “rare exception”, the minister would be able to ignore environmental standards and greenlight a project if it was deemed in the “national interest”.

While Watt has stressed the provision was intended for projects related to defence, national security and emergencies, the level of discretion written into the legislation has left him unable to rule out the possibility of exemptions for coal and gas.

The Labor MP Ed Husic previously warned a future Coalition minister could misuse the power while Henry and Samuel both predicted a “conga line” of developers would lobby for special carveouts.

Labor’s grassroots environmental action group also called for the power to be axed or at least subject to parliamentary oversight.

As of Friday afternoon, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, and the shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, were still waiting for Labor’s options for a potential deal.

The amendments would need to be put forward in coming days to give both sides time to get a deal through their respective party rooms early next week.

The EPBC bills are listed for debate in the Senate on Wednesday. Parliament rises for the year on Thursday.

Hanson-Young on Friday reiterated that the Greens wouldn’t support the legislation without extra protections for forests and the climate.

Labor cast the Greens as perpetual “blockers” in the previous term of parliament, but Hanson-Young said the party wasn’t feeling pressure to cave to the government’s demands.

“What plays on my mind is not allowing this government off the hook when they’re pushing for laws that will fast-track coal and gas,” she said.

Ahead of Friday’s hearings, an alliance of major environment groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society and the legal firm Environmental Justice Australia, urged major changes to a bill that it warned “[does] not protect nature”.

Among its suggested changes, the alliance called for the removal of new discretionary powers for the minister, the closing of loopholes for native forest logging, better engagement with First Nations communities, scrapping or limiting a proposed “restoration contributions” fund, consideration of climate impacts and reversing the decision to delegate decisions under the so-called “water trigger” to the states.

The alliance also wants the federal EPA to be the main decision-maker on projects, with the minister only allowed to intervene in “exceptional circumstances”.

Under the government’s model, which critics note is not genuinely independent, the minister would either make decisions or delegate that responsibility to an EPA official.

“We call on the Labor government to substantially improve the bills and negotiate in good faith with members of the Senate that care about nature and a vibrant, healthy Australia,” the groups said.

At Thursday’s round of inquiry hearings, the celebrated environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown said the laws were an “insult to the environmental conscience of Australians”.

He said the absence of a requirement for decision-makers to consider a project’s greenhouse gas emissions – known colloquially as a “climate trigger” – was analogous to stripping a treasurer of powers over taxation.

“And I say that must be taken seriously, because that’s how the situation is,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b5515bfd483d36ad19323b2846b05721d5dec5/0_249_5051_4041/master/5051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bd9785ad60e26efe6dc36cab6c325d6",N,,2025-11-22 13:00:23.803215

The draft deal would also launch a dialogue at upcoming COP climate summits on trade, involving governments and other actors including the World Trade Organization.","The COP30 climate summit was headed for a showdown on Friday over the future of fossil fuels after host Brazil dropped efforts to develop a global plan to shift away from oil, gas and coal from its proposed deal.

A draft text for a deal for this year's UN climate summit, released before dawn on Friday, contained no reference to fossil fuels, dropping entirely a range of options on the subject that had been included in an earlier version.

The issue has been one of the most contentious at the two-week conference of nearly 200 governments in Brazil's Amazon city of Belem.

A group of more than 30 nations sent a letter to the COP30 presidency late on Thursday saying they could not accept a deal that failed to include a commitment to develop a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels.

That has set the stage for a showdown in the final hours of the conference, which is scheduled to end at 6 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET). Previous COP summits have blown past their deadlines before eventually reaching a compromise.

""We are disappointed with the text currently on the table,"" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said in a statement, adding it lacked ambition on action to cut emissions.

Countries are set to air their thoughts on the draft in a public plenary session starting around 8 a.m. ET. The deal text, which is still subject to further negotiation, would need approval by consensus in order to be adopted.

Arguments over fossil fuel roadmap

For days, nations have wrangled over the future of fossil fuels, whose burning emits greenhouse gases that are by far the largest contributor to global warming.

Dozens of nations have been pushing hard for a ""roadmap"" laying out how countries should follow through with a promise made at COP28 two years ago to move away from fossil fuels.

Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations are opposing this, negotiators at COP30 told Reuters. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

A negotiator from one developing country told Reuters its government did not oppose a fossil fuel phase-out and was open to negotiating, but was concerned the draft text offered little to address their concerns on other issues, including finance.

""You can't keep saying that things that matter to us are no longer important and that things that matter to the developed countries are the only things that are important,"" the negotiator said.

The letter from those supporting a roadmap — who include Colombia, France, Germany, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain and Britain — said the draft deal, in its current form, ""does not meet the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.""

""We cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels,"" the letter said.

Canada did not sign the letter, Environment and Climate Change Canada confirmed to CBC News Friday.

In an emailed statement, an ECCC spokesperson said, ""Canada remains fully committed to advancing global climate action and supporting a transition away from fossil fuels in ways that respect national priorities and circumstances.""

The statement said Canada's representatives are focused on ""practical"" outcomes ""consistent with the direction we are taking at home.""

Climate finance, trade debated

The draft called for global efforts to triple the financing available to help nations adapt to climate change by 2030, from 2025 levels.

However, it did not specify whether this money would be provided directly by wealthy nations, or other sources, including development banks or the private sector.

That may disappoint poorer nations who want stronger guarantees that public money will be spent on this area.

Investments in adaptation — such as improving infrastructure to cope with extreme heat, or reinforcing buildings against worsening storms — are often vital for saving lives but offer little financial return, making it difficult for such investments to attract private finance.

The draft deal would also launch a dialogue at upcoming COP climate summits on trade, involving governments and other actors including the World Trade Organization.

That would be a win for countries including China who have long demanded that trade concerns be part of the world's climate summit.

But it may be uncomfortable for the European Union, as demands for such discussions have often focused on the EU carbon border levy.

The project began in October and the Scania 30 G 4×2 vehicle will travel from Cajamar to Taubaté, in São Paulo, Amazon’s main freight corridor in Brazil, for six months.

Exploring electric alternatives for long routes

The truck is recharged at Amazon’s logistics warehouse in Sort Centre CGH7 and goes to the carrier partner, To Do Green base. The route was officially announced as part of a wider unveiling of the Laneshift e-Dutra Alliance on at Cop in Belém, in which electric trucks will run along the Presidente Dutra Highway between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Saori Yano, head of sustainability for operations, Brazil at Amazon, said that throughout the six-month trial, the vehicle’s entire route and energy consumption/efficiency will be precisely monitored by telemetry to evaluate success metrics.

“Longer journeys are our biggest challenge, and this is where the impact of decarbonisation is most significant”

“We want to demonstrate that electrification isn’t confined to urban logistics; it is a viable and efficient solution for heavy-load, long-distance freight transport,” she said. “This is a decisive step in accelerating the transition to low-emission freight movement and advancing our global decarbonisation goal.”

For Cristina Argudo, C40’s deputy regional director in Latin America, this trial represents an important step toward exploring electric alternatives on long routes in the country, where road transport moves 65 per cent of cargo and generates 11 per cent of emissions, according to data from the Coalition for Decarbonising Transportation. “This test is not just about a truck; it’s about proving the technology in real-world conditions, inspiring investment in charging networks, and showing that it is possible to decarbonize transportation.”

The truck will transport various cargoes managed by DHL Supply Chain, and the test results will be essential for assessing the viability of completely sustainable long-distance transport, which is an important milestone for encouraging companies, investors, and governments.

“Longer journeys are our biggest challenge, and this is where the impact of decarbonisation is most significant. Therefore, by putting this truck on the road, we are redefining the future of logistics in Brazil and beginning the implementation of the green transport corridor,” celebrates João Meneghetti, sustainability director for Latin America at DHL Supply Chain.

This is Scania’s first 100 per cent electric tractor truck in Brazil and is aimed at transporters seeking to meet decarbonisation goals. The vehicle has a range of 250km, 300kW of power (410 hp), and the technical capacity is 66 tons in gross combination weight rating (GCWR).

“Scania has a very clear purpose: to lead the shift towards a more sustainable transport system,” said Alex Nucci, solutions sales director at Scania Commercial Operations Brazil.

“The electrification of trucks is a journey that is only just beginning, and we know the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges. That’s why partnerships with major global players such as Amazon and DHL are true milestones, not only for pointing out concrete paths to the future, but also for generating valuable learnings for the entire transport ecosystem.

“Sustainability must balance environmental, economic, and social pillars. Our role is to offer solutions that make sense within Brazil’s logistics and energy reality. Today, this means working with transition fuels such as natural gas, biomethane, and biodiesel, but electrification is the natural evolution of this movement. It represents transport free from CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s the direction we’re moving towards with determination.”

“We want to demonstrate that electrification isn’t confined to urban logistics; it is a viable and efficient solution for heavy-load, long-distance freight transport”

As part of the pilot project, the Scania 30 G 4×2 will travel along the Presidente Dutra Highway, one of the busiest routes in the country, where the Laneshift E-Dutra project is being developed. This project aims to implement Brazil’s first 100 per cent electric freight transport corridor, with charging hubs installed along the highway connecting São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro.

The project is a partnership between Volkswagen, Smart Freight Centre, Calstart, and C40 Cities, and is already in the testing phase. In September, a pilot trip was made between Resende (RJ) and Sorocaba (SP), covering approximately 800km, with an 11-ton Volkswagen e-Delivery truck.

The route, which included stops at strategic charging points along the highway, demonstrated the operational feasibility of the technology and allowed important data to be gathered on range, charging time, and infrastructure conditions. Currently, the corridor already has plans for fast charging stations at key locations, such as Graal and PIT São José dos Campos stations, with chargers with an average power of 120kW.",https://scwcontent.affino.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/056/Presidente_Dutra_Highway_Rio_smart_cities_Adobe1_rt.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 13:00:29.597289

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult.
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course.
The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.","Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — Delegates of the U.N. climate talks on Saturday worked to find common ground on a host of proposals, including a push by many nations to explicitly cite the cause of global warming: the burning of oil, gas and coal to power our world.

The annual talks are this year being held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and it wasn’t clear when they may finish.

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said Friday that the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from the conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil, because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor to strengthen climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year.

Before nations moved into high-level negotiations behind closed doors, Monterrey Gomez warned that talks were on “the verge of collapse.” A few hours later, he said nothing much had changed.

Do Lago started the day telling diplomats he thought they “are very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. When the all-country talks fizzled, do Lago pivoted to bringing in smaller pairings of negotiating teams for meeting in his office.

Talks behind schedule

“I would expect there needs to be another text,” veteran observer and former chief German climate negotiator Jennifer Morgan said late Friday afternoon. “I think there’s quite a lot of work to be done.”

The Brazilian proposals — also called texts — came on the heels of a fire on Thursday that briefly spread through pavilions of the conference known as COP30 on the edge of the Amazon. No one was seriously hurt but the fire meant that a day of work was largely lost.

“The problem is we’re 24 hours behind schedule,” said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute.

Cold reception from many

The European Union said flatly that it wouldn’t accept the text. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.

“Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU. “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.”

“After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.”

A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions.

Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it.

More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement.

“Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries.

Tackling fossil fuels

On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.”

The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions-curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map.

The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate-vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.”

Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.”

Getting everyone in one room

Agreements at these talks are officially reached when no nation objects and typically require many rounds of negotiations. In practice, the proceedings can end with agreements adopted and the presidency adjourning the meeting after noting any objections.

Instead of the usual small group meetings, the Brazilian presidency convened a meeting of nations’ top officials behind closed doors for much of Friday. It’s designed to lessen any nation feeling left out of backroom deals, but it doesn’t let the public see countries’ objections.

After a few hours it broke up with no sign of success and do Lago trying a different strategy.

“I simply find it very disheartening to see how so much greed for monetary value is pushing an entire community of people out of their homes who have expressed their distaste and their opposition to this,” she said. “And it seems to not be getting taken seriously.”

Terry Dugas, the general manager for the proposed plant, said in his remarks at the Thursday hearing that the complex will create 103 permanent full-time jobs and 110 indirect jobs. The company currently operates the world’s largest ammonia plant between Donaldsonville and the Sunshine Bridge.

“Our state-of-the-art ammonia production facility will have one of the lowest environmental footprints of any ammonia production facility in the world,” he said.

And while industry, nonprofit and Chamber of Commerce leaders spoke in favor of the permit—saying the plant will bring much-needed jobs and the company has been an important parish partner for nearly 60 years—few elected officials attended. It marked a departure from similar meetings in the past, which have seen local and state leaders support and oppose carbon capture proposals.

Locals say they don’t want the plant

The facility is one of a number looking to build in the sugarcane fields of west Ascension, a roughly 17,000-acre region called the RiverPlex MegaPark. Several corporations intend to build large industrial facilities in the area. Hyundai has announced a $5.8-billion steel mill north of Modeste, and the Texas-based Clean Hydrogen Works seeks to build a $7.5-billion ammonia plant.

At Thursday’s hearing, a half-dozen officers with the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office and a Louisiana State Police deputy attended the meeting. Last year, a fire official shut down a Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality meeting due to overcrowding.

Paul Troxclair, a former Iberville Parish resident who said he moved to Modeste because the company Shintech expanded near his home, said he was opposed because of chemical releases and it would remove important sugarcane land.

“I’ve worked in chemical plants for 40-plus years of my life,” he said. “And they can say all they want, you can have all the safety stuff you want, but you’re releasing stuff every day that people are breathing.”

Others, like Prairieville resident Denise Drago, said they didn’t want the planned carbon dioxide pipelines that would be connected to such a facility.

“There are no guarantees that the carbon sequestration will remain perfectly stored underground,” she said. ""It’s all risk and no rewards. That’s why I’m asking for this permit not to be issued.”

Not every resident opposed it. Eugene Britton, Gonzales resident and employee of the Donaldsonville plant, and Donaldsonville resident Ali Kocke, a CF Industries human resources supervisor, both said the company was committed to safety and helping the community.

Some Capital Region nonprofit leaders voiced support, including Brian Hightower, the chief development officer of the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank, and George Bell, the president and CEO of Capital Area United Way.

Bell said he supported the new plant because Ascension Parish has been split between an economically prosperous east side and an impoverished west side.

“I see this as an opportunity for this area to really thrive and to come back and really gain the kinds of jobs and access to the kinds of jobs that are really needed here,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/de/3defb8af-9a58-5d34-b172-9723c366f5f5/69208a4523a01.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-22 07:59:50.864414

xAI’s Southern Colossus should thus be seen in the context of an emerging AI doctrine in the United States.
Notably, economists have warned that the resulting fast development of AI infrastructure is sustaining the entire US economy.","Boxtown is a neighborhood in South Memphis established in 1863 by emancipated former slaves. Since 2024, it is also the home to one of the world’s largest supercomputers, property of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI. Amidst politicians’ talk about innovation, development, and growth, and boosterism about the US American South’s “data boom,” Boxtown shows how the push to “win the race” of AI is shaping local landscapes in the United States. In Boxtown, the environmental effects of a gargantuan computer accrue with geological obstinacy on top of decades of environmental and health hazards, as well as longer legacies of plantation and racial violence, policy, and urban neglect.

The environmental risks and health impacts of this facility have raised the alarms of journalists, scientists, scholars, and citizen groups. Methane turbines churning toxic pollutants around the clock; a community railroaded by the well-funded interests of energy-hungry technology companies; the glitzy language of economic opportunity mobilizing acquiescent city administrators to harbor regulation-averse capital flows. And yet, its advance is unimpeded, aided by a variety of financial, rhetorical, and legal instruments. If the rush to build AI infrastructure is a national phenomenon tied to grandiose aspirations of economic and techno-cultural renewal, its local impacts show it is also unevenly transforming the landscape of the United States.

The computer housed in xAI’s facility near Boxtown is named “Colossus”—a name which computing historians will quickly associate with the storied super computer built in northwest London to support the work of cryptanalysts during World War II. Instead of decoding German ciphers, however, the Colossus now standing in the Mississippi river’s eastern margin services xAI, the company that Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, established to train AI models. In a caustic twist of history, while the first Colossus was built to decode and disrupt Nazi messages, the second seems inclined to recast and amplify them. xAI’s most famous product, Grok, is a chatbot which in 2025 made international news for praising Hitler, spewing antisemitic rants, and insistently bringing up the absurd idea of a “white genocide” in South Africa, seemingly parroting the views of its owner.

That the Mississippi Colossus requires a yearly energy expenditure equivalent to that of hundreds of thousands of homes—and that clouds of methane and formaldehyde are dumped into a dangerously warming atmosphere in the process—prompts questions about the nature and convenience of this technology, and about its role as an accelerator of extreme ideology, wealth concentration, and environmental collapse. As Rev. Dr. Heber Brown put it: “The emissions from the facility … are the same whether Grok is generating images of rock bands fronted by cats or posting tweets like ‘The white man stands for innovation, grit and not bending to PC nonsense,’ as it did recently. But polluting the nearby neighborhood of Boxtown in order to generate posts like the latter certainly adds insult to injury.”

Boxtown’s antebellum history is tied to the agricultural economy of the cotton plantation, which flourished on its rich river valley topsoil thanks to the labor of enslaved people of African descent. The neighborhood is located in Tennessee’s Shelby County, specifically on the land of the former Ensley cotton plantation. Convict labor extended the agricultural use of this land after the Civil War and until the early twentieth century, informing the postbellum development of African American neighborhoods. With the decline of the cotton industry after the Civil War, steam plants and steel mills found their way into the area.

Boxtown sits in Memphis’ southern periphery flanked on the west by an industrial zone, which aside from xAI’s facility includes a large steel processing facility for Nucor, one of the country’s largest steel manufacturers. In the North, the neighborhood is limited by the T.O. Fuller State park, another portion of the former Ensley plantation, sold in 1938 to create “the first park open for African Americans east of the Mississippi river.” The neighborhood thus has a history of air pollution, health hazards, and resistance that precedes the digital age. And yet, in Boxtown, Old South patterns of land use and their associated dynamics of capital accumulation persist and combine today with the interests of a new industrialist class, shaping its urban form.

AI’s new economy in Boxtown literally dwells in the shell of previous industries. On the east margin of the Mississippi river, xAI’s facility occupies a building previously owned by Electrolux, the Swedish washing machine and dishwasher appliances company. The company sold the facility to xAI in 2024 and transferred its operations to Springfield, Tennessee. We might draw a contrast between the affective spheres of these respective technological eras. If powered appliances promised an easier and more enjoyable life by easing the highly gendered toil of domestic labor, the services provided by xAI’s promise to drastically reorganize the market of cognitive labor. But this vision is not accompanied by bucolic or leisurely images of a future without work. Proponents of AI are, for the most part, content with using this technology to put workers on notice.

The displacement of physical manufacturing in the US by the industrial production of language and images via data and energy-intensive computational processes reveals the country’s broader economic and techno-cultural transition. And yet, from cotton plantations, steam, and steel manufacturing to the current manufacturing of digital data, the neighborhood’s residents have organized. Boxtown has been and continues to be an urbanism of resistance.

The Environmental Politics of AI in the US

The race to dominate the global economy of AI requires a drastic increase in data storage, hardware manufacturing, and processing capacity. All of this extends the United States’s reliance on power plants using fossil fuels, fundamentally derailing efforts towards a clean energy transition. An important portion of these costs are associated with the powering and cooling of data centers. A forecast estimates that by 2026, excess energy demands for powering data centers will be comparable to the entire energy expenditure of Japan, up to 1,050 terawatts. In addition, a data center’s daily water consumption is in the hundreds of thousands of gallons. Further, material and energy-intensive processes to produce integrated circuits, processors, and semiconductors for AI accentuate problematic labor and mineral extractive dynamics. With this complicated picture as a background, wishful voices have emphasized the need to power the data economy with cleaner forms of energy. Others have minimized these potential impacts, deferring them, in a form of magical thinking, as something that AI itself might solve in the future. However, given the AI industry’s projections of growth, and their unrestricted embrace by the US government, what seems most likely is that “winning the race” of AI simply means relinquishing the goal of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning into clean energy.

xAI’s Southern Colossus should thus be seen in the context of an emerging AI doctrine in the United States. Its relentless march is enabled by a US government dictate to “build, baby, build” computing infrastructure by streamlining the process of issuing permissions for data centers, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and energy infrastructure by exempting these from environmental regulations. Penned by presidential science advisor Michael J. Kratsios, “special advisor for AI and Crypto” David O. Sacks, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Marco Rubio, the report aligns with the Trump administration’s well documented animosity against environmental protections. Notably, economists have warned that the resulting fast development of AI infrastructure is sustaining the entire US economy. Aside from rescuing the coal mining industry, hardware companies supplying the AI industry with microprocessors seem to explain, at least for the moment, US stock market gains, however raising concerns about “circular financing.” In addition, with data center construction outpacing office space construction, AI seems to be offering the field of architecture a lifeline in an otherwise declining construction industry. Amidst global economic uncertainty, and increasing warnings about a financial bubble, the US seems to have placed its bet firmly—and exclusively—on AI.

Aside from promising to secure US military, economic, and scientific superiority—as well as an artistic “renaissance” through digital art—the US AI doctrine has important spatial and environmental dimensions. xAI’s unpermitted use of harmful methane gas turbines to power its Memphis facility illustrates that the social and environmental harms of computing infrastructures are not evenly distributed, and disproportionately affect zones inhabited by Black and other underprivileged communities, which experts have described as “sacrificial zones.” Alongside these environmental effects, the construction of AI infrastructure entails costs that citizens are already beginning to shoulder. In Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, for example, utilities companies are building natural gas infrastructure aimed at producing more than 20,000 megawatts by 2040, largely for powering data centers in these states. If these plans are realized, households in these states will pay even higher electricity rates to subsidize an oversized, fossil fuel–powered grid which heats the atmosphere and largely works to consolidate an increasingly privatized and surveilling data economy. These new land use patterns are rapidly leaving a mark on US landscapes.

In their disproportionate scale, the spatial disclosures of AI infrastructures can accidentally resemble utopian architectures. An image shared by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows an aerial view of the island of Manhattan with its landmass dominated by a colossal box. The image is meant to convey the gargantuan scale of Hyperion, the Meta data center currently under construction in Louisiana. As observed by media scholar Roland Meyer, Buckminster Fuller’s Dome over Manhattan (1959) and Zuckerberg’s Hyperion data center (2025) represent drastically different (albeit similarly megalomaniacal) ecological aspirations. While Fuller’s three-kilometer-wide geodesic dome sought to reduce energy consumption, Zuckerberg’s gigantic extruded box is premised on its waste.

Proponents of AI wield maximalist claims about economic growth, intelligence, and geopolitical economic and military dominance in order to gather capital and attention, and to drown concerns about the inconvenient impacts of AI on the environment and labor. While ostensibly linked to productivity and competitiveness, it is currently difficult to disentangle AI in the United States from a political project committed to oligarchic power, the surveillance and militarization of civic life, aggressive imperial foreign policy, and racist nation-building fantasies. And all of this is taking place while AI technologies threaten to become the very lens through which we look into and participate in political reality.

The dance of billionaire and state power outlines this mechanics. The picture that has emerged is that of a cadre of obsequious billionaires greasing the wheels of presidential munificence in the form of contracts and tariff exemptions with juicy political contributions and curtsies. Despite the critical attention this farcical race has attracted, it seems to be paying off. The same week xAI was forced to issue a public apology for repeatedly bringing up Nazi rhetoric, it announced a $200 million deal with the US Department of Defense (DoD). At the same time, the US Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) boasted that similar contracts were procured between the US Department of Defense and other technology giants including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. And the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a government initiative led by Elon Musk, helped slash around two billion US dollars from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the very government agency in charge of overseeing the AI industry’s environmental impacts. Supported by this combination of self-dealing, obsequiousness, disdain for environmental concerns, and technological tunnel vision, the construction of AI infrastructure, and the forms of power that enable it, advances.

Really Large Time-sharing or the Schematic Geography of AI

The spatial configuration of present-day AI infrastructure increasingly distributes computing power away from users, relocating it in privatized, highly polluting super centers such as xAI’s. This recalls an earlier moment in the history of computing, when large mainframe computers provided computing services to numerous terminals distributed across organizations such as university campuses, government offices, or large companies. Known as “time-sharing,” this early form of networked computing aimed at making scarce computing resources available to many users who might not be aware that they are sharing a computer.

Today’s geography of AI, with software services increasingly relying on server-side processing, bears a structural resemblance with the spatial logic of this Cold War–era computing paradigm. However, as we have seen, the distribution of computing resources today takes place at an altogether different scale. The computing superclusters servicing the AI economy are not merely in a different location within a building or campus, but in a different city, country, or continent. As a result, users are removed from the material and environmental dimensions of computing, contributing to the obfuscation of its costs and hazards. Extruding a text or an image using an AI service can appear as a smooth, frictionless transaction only because the space, energy, and water these require are removed from users’ experience. Further, by centralizing computing in facilities such as xAI’s Boxtown data center, citizens’ data routinely circulates and is processed in distant jurisdictions, under increasingly privatized conditions, lowering thresholds for surveillance and information manipulation.

In ways that resemble previous eras of technological investment, we are witnessing the coupling of US government and industry in the construction of a new socio-technical infrastructure. In the background of the US’s ongoing plan to deploy AI infrastructure is the historical entwining of the US industry and government sectors throughout the twentieth century. Since the decades following the Second World War, US officials saw computers as useful instruments to secure global militaristic and economic dominance, and to realize a worldview centered on economic growth, open markets, and international competitiveness. Vast sums of federal funds were directed to university research and technology transfer programs aimed at reorganizing the US manufacturing industry around computers. These investments outpaced those of any of the other industrialized economies, configuring technological and scientific standards that firmed the United States’s role as a global hegemon, and shaped a distinctly US American “innovation” culture of scientific production, industry collaboration, and design. In the 1990s, a comparably large wave of financial and cultural capital placed the internet at the center of the country’s economic doctrine, with its own infrastructural demands. During this long postwar period, technologies such as numerical control, computer-aided design, and the internet helped model a postwar international order after US interests, ostensibly on ideas about productivity, growth, international competition, and open markets. By virtue of their role in standardizing industrial production, commerce, and culture, they can be seen as relatively soft instruments of US empire. The Trump administration’s action plan to “win the race” of AI refurbishes the language of these previous waves of financial and cultural fervor about US technology, but places them within a different economic and historical trajectory inflected by openly protectionist and ethno-nationalistic political sensibilities. The postwar period of economic expansion in the US, characterized by government-sponsored university research, social security, environmental protections, public education, and health, is now, after forty years of political and cultural erosion, on the chopping block, making way for private interests to further encyst and exert greater influence over all aspects of US politics and life. As we have seen, the concentration of computing power across networks of privatized super centers is one manifestation of this dynamic.

Computing has never been neutral, but the form of mediation proposed by many AI systems suggests deeper impacts into how knowledge is not just shared but also produced and manipulated. That these processes are increasingly under the control of private actors of incalculable wealth and questionable commitments to democracy, should raise questions about what the US AI doctrine portends not just for the environment but also the body politic in the United States and beyond.

Counteractions

The perception of AI as a frictionless, neatly automated process rests on hiding its material and social substrates and environmental effects. Making these visible has been the important work of citizens, activists, scholars, journalists, and independent organizations interested in advancing the causes of environmental justice and democratic governance. In Boxtown, activist organizations including Memphis Community Against Pollution (MCAP) and Protect Our Aquifer have sounded the alarm about the planning process leading to the construction of xAI’s facility and scrutinized the company’s promises regarding air quality and water use, which has led to an independent air monitoring study. A recent protest named “Get Out of Memphis” organized by the student activist group Tigers Against Pollution brought attention to these issues, prompting the deployment of federal law enforcement under president Trump’s pledge to “fight crime in the city.”

Beyond Boxtown and around the US, citizen groups and non-profit organizations work to increase democratic oversight on computing infrastructures by conducting independent research, mobilizing public opinion, and supporting related legislation. For example, in a 2025 Data & Society policy brief, Tamara Kneese and Maia Woluchem draw on journalistic, academic, and industry research to scrutinize common claims of AI as the catalyst of growth, alternative energy development, and national security, noting that “achieving computing abundance requires exhausting the planetary bounds of our ecological resources, energy, and labor, all of which are required to support this industrial development.” The Tech Workers Coalition, a New York–based group, supported a state-level act requiring the disclosure, hearings, and annual reports about the fossil fuel consumption, water, and energy, of all data centers in the state of New York, and that they all transition to renewable energy by 2030. The act, which was not passed, was inspired by examples of data center legislation from Virginia and Germany, and included consumer protections such as community discount plans and preventing “backroom deals” between tech companies and utility companies. , directed by Tech Workers Coalition, 2025, ➝.] And in partnership with researchers at the University of Michigan, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition has released policy and citizen action recommendations based on a review of the impacts of data center construction and energy demands in communities across several states, notably also including the adoption of regulation and transparency approaches inspired by German legislation on this issue.

While academic and industry researchers have pursued the notion of “Responsible AI,” they have overwhelmingly focused on topics such as implicit bias and disinformation, leaving open questions about the environmental effects of AI’s underlying infrastructure. In a similar vein, US linguist and natural language processing scholar Emily M. Bender has observed that researchers working under the banner of “AI Safety” have mostly avoided seriously confronting AI’s social and environmental dimensions—at times simply channeling AI industry propaganda as well as white supremacist fantasies. More on point, scholars in the social sciences, arts, and humanities have in recent years approached data centers as subjects of empirical analysis and critical scrutiny. For example Dustin Edwards, Zane Griffin, and Mél Hogan have proposed “Critical Data Center Studies” as a new interdisciplinary area of study critically focused on contemporary computing infrastructures. The landscape of critical scholarship they chart draws on concepts and methods from fields including anthropology, history, and science and technology studies (STS), and ranges from studies of the physical infrastructure of the internet, real estate and land use aspects of data center construction, to ethnographies of data centers and other AI infrastructures. Architecture and other design disciplines might hold clues to open up spatial and environmental dimensions of this phenomenon.

Science and technology scholar Langdon Winner proposes that certain technologies, by virtue of their scale and configuration, can be seen to enact a politics. Nuclear reactors, he notes, require centralized forms of power for their deployment and operation that might be antithetical to democratic governance. As the deployment of the xAI Colossus onto Boxtown suggests, the US AI doctrine and the nation-wide development of data-intensive computing infrastructure both requires and expresses a worldview organized around undemocratic concentrations of capital, space, and political agency. The existence of democracy in the United States and of breathable air in Boxtown are in this way intimately intertwined.",https://images.e-flux.com/test/426fed3e-6e3e-4137-b25d-7f11fc9f6ca0?width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-11-22 09:58:09.626894

By delivering reliable, 24/7 renewable power, Copiapó will help decarbonize Chile’s steel and mining sectors, among the nation’s largest energy consumers.
'The Copiapó project reflects Chile’s growing capability to pair renewable generation with storage and supply clean energy to key industrial sectors,' said Esteban Uauy, Global Head of Project Finance at Atlas Renewable Energy.
The company, an international renewable energy solutions provider with more than 8.4 GW in its portfolio, develops, finances, builds and operates clean-energy projects across Latin America, including 1.5 GW of contracted capacity in Chile.
Atlas currently operates three large-scale solar plants – Javiera (Atacama), Quilapilún (Metropolitan Region), and Sol del Desierto (Antofagasta) – as well as BESS del Desierto, the country’s first large-scale standalone storage project.","DNV acted as market advisor to support Atlas Renewable Energy in securing USD 475 million in financing for the Copiapó hybrid solar and battery storage project in Chile. The financing was arranged with a consortium of leading financial institutions including BBVA, BCI, Crédit Agricole CIB (CACIB), Natixis CIB, SMBC, and Société Générale.

Located in Chile’s Atacama Region, Copiapó combines 357 MWp of solar capacity with a 320 MW/1.28 GWh battery system, capable of providing four hours of storage. The project will supply clean energy equivalent to 750 GWh per year to CAP Group subsidiaries – CMP and Aguas CAP (part of Chile’s leading steel and mining conglomerate) – under two long-term 15-year power purchase agreements (PPAs). By delivering reliable, 24/7 renewable power, Copiapó will help decarbonize Chile’s steel and mining sectors, among the nation’s largest energy consumers.

DNV helped de-risk the project’s complex revenue structure for lenders. The scope included market due diligence, review of the power purchase agreements, and battery revenue-stacking and dispatch-optimization analysis to demonstrate long-term bankability. This independent validation strengthened lender confidence and supported the achievement of highly competitive financing terms.

'Chile is showing what the next chapter of the energy transition looks like,' said Santiago Blanco, Executive Vice President and Regional Director for Latin America, Energy Systems at DNV. 'Projects like Copiapó thrive because the country has combined exceptional natural resources — including world-class solar irradiance to a domestic lithium industry — with strong public support and clear, long-term policy signals. This combination creates the conditions for large-scale solar-plus-storage projects to deliver reliable, clean power to industry and serve as a model for other nations to follow.'

'The Copiapó project reflects Chile’s growing capability to pair renewable generation with storage and supply clean energy to key industrial sectors,' said Esteban Uauy, Global Head of Project Finance at Atlas Renewable Energy. 'DNV’s support helped reinforce lender confidence and highlight the project’s strengths in a rapidly evolving market. Together, we’re demonstrating how collaboration and innovation can accelerate the region’s energy transition.”

This transaction marks a milestone in a record year for Atlas Renewable Energy in Chile, bringing its total project financings closed in the last 13 months to over USD 1.2 billion. The company, an international renewable energy solutions provider with more than 8.4 GW in its portfolio, develops, finances, builds and operates clean-energy projects across Latin America, including 1.5 GW of contracted capacity in Chile.

Atlas currently operates three large-scale solar plants – Javiera (Atacama), Quilapilún (Metropolitan Region), and Sol del Desierto (Antofagasta) – as well as BESS del Desierto, the country’s first large-scale standalone storage project. Together with Copiapó, these facilities underscore Chile’s emergence as one of the world’s most advanced clean-energy markets. With more than 70% of its power generation already renewable and an 80% target set for 2030, the country is demonstrating how ambitious policy, investor confidence, and technological innovation can align to accelerate decarbonization and inspire similar progress across Latin America and beyond.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult.
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course.
The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.","Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-20251114-56-2dszop.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 05:58:28.348578

The global energy infrastructure transformation creates unprecedented demand for specialized materials that enable renewable systems, electric vehicles, and digital networks. Among these enabling materials, certain metals exhibit properties that make them irreplaceable across multiple clean energy applications while facing constrained supply pipelines and geopolitical concentration risks.

This analysis examines strategic positioning frameworks for materials that serve as infrastructure components rather than energy storage elements. Unlike lithium or cobalt, which primarily function within battery chemistries, these enabling materials create the fundamental connections and protective systems that allow clean energy technologies to operate reliably across decades-long operational lifecycles.

Atomic Structure Creates Irreplaceable Clean Energy Applications

Tin's strategic value in clean energy transition stems from its unique atomic configuration with 50 protons that creates specific metallurgical properties essential for renewable energy electronics. The metal's crystalline structure enables formation of reliable solder joints that maintain electrical conductivity under thermal cycling conditions typical in solar inverters, wind turbine electronics, and electric vehicle power systems.

Modern renewable energy installations require thousands of individual electrical connections per megawatt of capacity. Each photovoltaic panel contains approximately 1,000-1,500 solder joints connecting solar cells to electrical circuits. These connections must withstand temperature variations from -40°C to +85°C over 25-year operational periods while maintaining consistent electrical resistance.

Critical Properties Enabling Clean Energy Applications:

Thermal stability: Maintains mechanical integrity across temperature ranges

Corrosion resistance: Provides long-term reliability in outdoor installations

Electrical conductivity: Enables efficient power transfer with minimal losses

Workability: Allows precise application in miniaturised electronics

The transition from lead-based to tin-based solder systems, mandated by the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, created structural demand growth as electronics manufacturers globally adopted tin-silver-copper alloy systems. This regulatory shift established tin as the standard for all new electronics manufacturing serving renewable energy markets.

Advanced Semiconductor Requirements Drive Precision Demand

Next-generation power electronics require solder systems capable of atomic-level precision in chip-scale packaging applications. Advanced inverters for solar installations and electric vehicle powertrains utilise wide-bandgap semiconductors that operate at higher temperatures and switching frequencies than traditional silicon devices.

These advanced semiconductor packages demand solder alloys with specific thermal expansion coefficients that match silicon carbide and gallium nitride substrates. Tin-silver-copper formulations provide the precise thermal expansion matching required to prevent mechanical failure during thermal cycling in high-performance applications.

Furthermore, as highlighted by Wood Mackenzie's analysis, the role of tin in the energy transition has been significantly undervalued despite its critical applications.

According to industry projections, each megawatt of renewable energy infrastructure requires approximately 15-20 kilograms of specialised solder materials across inverters, monitoring systems, and grid interconnection hardware.

Multiple Demand Growth Scenarios Through 2035

Scenario modelling for tin consumption reflects different pathways for global electrification and technology deployment. These scenarios incorporate electric vehicle adoption rates, renewable energy capacity growth, and data centre expansion driven by artificial intelligence applications.

Accelerated Transition Scenario:

Electric vehicle market share reaches 70% of new sales by 2030

Solar photovoltaic capacity grows 300% from 2024 baseline

Data centre computing power increases 250% supporting renewable grid management

Projected annual tin consumption: 580,000 tonnes by 2035

Baseline Development Scenario:

Electric vehicle adoption reaches 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030

Solar capacity doubles from current installed base

Steady electronics manufacturing growth

Projected annual tin consumption: 480,000 tonnes by 2035

Conservative Transition Scenario:

Electric vehicle adoption limited to 35% by infrastructure constraints

Renewable energy deployment constrained by grid integration challenges

Projected annual tin consumption: 420,000 tonnes by 2035

Current global tin production operates near 350,000 tonnes annually, indicating potential supply deficits across all scenarios unless new primary production comes online. The International Tin Association projects demand growth of up to 40 percent by 2030, primarily driven by electrification and semiconductor applications.

Supply Response Constraints Create Strategic Bottlenecks

New tin mining projects require 7-12 years from discovery to commercial production, creating structural inflexibility in supply response to demand growth. Unlike industrial materials with multiple production pathways, primary tin extraction depends on specific geological formations that limit potential supply sources.

Global Tin Production Analysis:

Region Annual Production Development Potential Supply Security China 95,000 tonnes Limited expansion Domestic priority Indonesia 72,000 tonnes Moderate growth Export restrictions Myanmar 48,000 tonnes Declining output Political instability Peru 19,000 tonnes High potential Stable jurisdiction Bolivia 18,000 tonnes Expansion possible Resource nationalism

Indonesia's position as the second-largest producer creates particular supply chain vulnerability. The country has implemented export licensing requirements and local processing mandates that constrain tin availability for international markets. These policies reflect broader trends toward resource nationalism that prioritise domestic value-added processing over raw material exports.

Geographic Concentration Amplifies Supply Vulnerabilities

Approximately 65% of global tin production originates from Southeast Asia, where political instability, regulatory changes, and infrastructure limitations create recurring supply disruptions. Myanmar's contribution of approximately 48,000 tonnes annually faces ongoing challenges from civil conflict and international sanctions.

This geographic concentration creates systemic risks similar to rare earth element dependencies that prompted strategic stockpiling initiatives in the United States and European Union. However, establishing Europe's CRM hub represents a crucial step toward supply chain diversification.

Strategic Stockpiling Initiatives Address Critical Dependencies

The United States consumes approximately 32,000 tonnes of tin annually while producing zero primary tin domestically. This complete import dependence mirrors vulnerabilities identified in rare earth elements, lithium, and other critical minerals supply chain dependencies essential for national security applications.

Government strategic reserves serve multiple functions beyond supply security. Reserve purchases provide price stability during demand surges whilst creating strategic optionality for supply chain disruptions. The U.S. Defense Production Act authorises federal investment in domestic processing capabilities and alternative supply development.

Critical Supply Chokepoints:

Indonesian export licensing and processing requirements

Myanmar political instability affecting 14% of global supply

Limited smelting capacity outside Asia-Pacific region

Transportation bottlenecks through Southeast Asian ports

European Union policy frameworks include tin among critical raw materials subject to supply diversification mandates. The Critical Raw Materials Act establishes targets for reducing import dependencies and developing domestic processing capabilities for materials deemed essential for clean energy transition.

Technology Evolution Creates Expanding Applications

Renewable energy infrastructure expansion requires tin-based electronics across multiple system components. Solar photovoltaic installations utilise tin solder for electrical connections between cells, junction boxes, combiner circuits, and power conditioning equipment.

Wind energy systems incorporate tin solder in generator electronics, power conversion equipment, and control systems. Each wind turbine contains approximately 1-2 tonnes of electronics requiring specialised solder materials designed for vibration resistance and long-term reliability.

Technology Trend Analysis:

Bifacial solar panels: Increase tin consumption by 30% per installation

Floating solar systems: Require enhanced corrosion protection

Advanced inverter technologies: Demand higher-performance solder systems

Grid-scale energy storage: Creates new tin application categories

Electric Vehicle Electronics Complexity Scaling

Modern electric vehicles contain 4-6 times more electronic components than internal combustion vehicles. Battery management systems, power electronics, charging infrastructure, and autonomous driving sensors create dense networks of tin-soldered connections throughout vehicle electrical systems.

In addition to transportation applications, understanding the broader context of energy transition minerals helps illustrate tin's strategic positioning within the clean energy ecosystem.

Per-Vehicle Tin Content Analysis:

Battery management and safety systems: 0.9-1.3 kg per vehicle

Power electronics and motor controllers: 1.2-1.8 kg per vehicle

Charging and connectivity systems: 0.5-0.7 kg per vehicle

Autonomous driving electronics: 0.4-1.2 kg per vehicle (emerging)

Electric vehicle charging infrastructure represents an additional demand category requiring tin-based electronics for power conversion, grid interconnection, and communication systems. Each fast-charging station contains approximately 15-25 kg of electronics requiring specialised solder materials.

Investment Framework Development for Critical Materials Exposure

Traditional commodity valuation models inadequately capture tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond standard supply-demand fundamentals. Alternative analytical frameworks must incorporate supply security premiums, substitution constraints, and technology adoption multipliers.

Strategic Valuation Components:

Base commodity fundamentals: Current market price and demand volumes

Supply security premium: 20-30% markup reflecting geopolitical concentration

Technology adoption multiplier: 1.3-2.1x based on electrification deployment pace

Strategic reserve demand: Additional 5-10% from government stockpiling

Portfolio construction for tin exposure requires indirect approaches through mining equities, integrated materials companies, and technology manufacturers. Direct tin investment vehicles remain limited compared to precious metals or energy commodities.

Risk-Return Modelling Across Investment Vehicles

Monte Carlo simulations incorporating demand scenarios, supply disruptions, and price volatility suggest tin-exposed investments could outperform broader commodity indices by 180-350 basis points annually through 2030, though with higher volatility profiles.

Investment Exposure Options:

Primary tin producers: Direct exposure with operational risk concentration

Diversified miners: Tin revenue components within broader metal portfolios

Electronics manufacturers: Indirect exposure through tin-intensive product lines

Strategic material funds: Emerging vehicles focusing on critical mineral exposure

Risk-adjusted return optimisation requires balancing direct commodity exposure against operational risks in tin-producing regions. Companies with established operations in stable jurisdictions command valuation premiums despite potentially lower tin grades or production volumes.

Corporate Strategy Development for Supply Chain Resilience

Technology companies dependent on tin-intensive manufacturing should develop comprehensive procurement strategies incorporating price hedging, supplier diversification, and strategic inventory optimisation. Supply chain resilience has become a competitive advantage as critical material availability constraints affect production scheduling.

Moreover, companies must align their procurement strategies with evolving critical minerals strategy frameworks at the national level to ensure long-term supply security.

Strategic Procurement Framework Elements:

Multi-year demand forecasting: Integrating technology roadmaps with material requirements

Geographic supplier assessment: Evaluating political and operational risks

Inventory optimisation: Balancing carrying costs against supply security

Alternative material research: Long-term substitution development programmes

Research and development investments should prioritise tin-efficient technologies that maintain performance whilst reducing material intensity. Companies achieving superior tin utilisation efficiency gain competitive advantages as supply constraints tighten.

Policy Coordination Requirements for International Cooperation

Effective critical material security requires coordination between consuming nations, producing countries, and multilateral organisations. Policy frameworks must address mining investment incentives, recycling infrastructure development, and strategic reserve coordination.

The United States, European Union, Japan, and Australia have established coordination mechanisms for critical material supply chain resilience. These frameworks include information sharing on production capacity, joint strategic reserve management, and coordinated responses to supply disruptions.

International cooperation initiatives focus on supporting responsible mining development in emerging jurisdictions whilst building domestic processing capabilities in consuming countries. Furthermore, considering the insights from CRUX Investor's analysis, technology transfer programmes and development finance mechanisms aim to diversify supply sources beyond current geographic concentrations.

Defence Applications Heighten Strategic Importance

Military applications of tin extend beyond commercial electronics to encompass specialised defence systems requiring extreme reliability under harsh operational conditions. Advanced radar systems, military communications equipment, and precision weaponry depend on tin-based solder joints that maintain functionality across temperature extremes and electromagnetic interference.

The development of a comprehensive defence minerals strategy recognises tin's dual-use nature and the need for secure supply chains to support both civilian infrastructure and military applications.

Defence-Critical Tin Applications:

Military communications: Secure radio and satellite systems

Avionics electronics: Aircraft navigation and control systems

Naval systems: Shipboard electronics and sonar equipment

Land-based defence: Radar installations and command centres

This dual-use characteristic elevates tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond commercial considerations to encompass national security implications that justify government intervention in supply chain development.

Strategic Positioning for Material-Enabled Energy Transition

Tin's strategic importance extends beyond traditional commodity market dynamics to encompass national security considerations, technological sovereignty, and industrial competitiveness factors. The material's irreplaceable role in electronics manufacturing positions it as critical infrastructure for renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and digital networks supporting decarbonisation.

Strategic scenario modelling indicates potential supply tightness emerging by 2027-2028 under baseline electrification scenarios, with more severe constraints possible by 2030-2031 if technology deployment accelerates beyond current projections. Geographic supply concentration in politically unstable regions amplifies these risks whilst limited substitution options constrain demand elasticity.

Investment approaches must recognise tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond traditional commodity fundamentals, incorporating the material's role as enabling infrastructure for clean energy transition. Corporate strategic planning should prioritise supply chain diversification and efficiency improvements, whilst policy frameworks require international coordination on critical material security.

The convergence of electrification trends, supply constraints, and geopolitical factors positions tin among the most strategically significant materials for the next decade of energy infrastructure development. Organisations that develop comprehensive strategies for tin's strategic value in clean energy transition exposure and supply security will be better positioned to capitalise on clean energy transition opportunities whilst managing material availability risks.

This analysis reflects current market conditions and technological trends. Commodity markets involve substantial risks, and material demand projections contain inherent uncertainties. Investors should conduct independent research and consider professional advisory services before making investment decisions.

The wind farms collectively generated an unprecedented 22.7 gigawatts (GW) of electricity. That impressive output was sufficient to power 22 million homes, a visible demonstration of the nation’s accelerating transition to a clean energy future.

This new peak comfortably beats the previous wind generation record of 22.5 GW, set less than a year earlier on December 18, 2024.

For a brief but significant moment, wind energy alone supplied over half of the nation’s demand.

As per SkyNews, the country had experienced windy conditions, particularly in the north of England and Scotland.

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, revealed the practical, immediate benefit of the new record. “On a cold, dark November evening, wind was generating enough electricity to power 80% of British homes when we needed it most.”

A new energy mix dominates

According to the National Energy System Operator (Neso), wind energy supplied 43.6 percent of Britain’s electricity on November 11, enough to power over three-quarters of British homes.

Furthermore, 12.1% came from “embedded wind” generation, which feeds local distribution networks directly rather than the main transmission network, pushing the overall wind power total to 55.7%.

The remaining energy came from a diverse mix of sources, with gas (12.5%) and interconnectors (11.3%) as the next-largest contributors, followed by nuclear (8%) and biomass (8%). Minor contributions were made by hydro (1.4%) and storage (1.1%), illustrating a highly decarbonised and varied energy mix for the period.

“This is a world-beating record, showing that our national grid can run safely and securely on large quantities of renewables generated right here in Britain,” said Kayte O’Neill, chief operating officer at Neso.

“We’ve come on leaps and bounds in wind generation in recent years. It really shows what is possible, and I look forward to seeing if we can hit another clean energy milestone in the months ahead: running Britain’s electricity grid entirely zero carbon,” O’Neill added.

Clean energy goals

The UK’s current wind power capacity, standing at roughly 32 GW and nearly equally divided between onshore and offshore turbines, provides the foundation for this enormous generation.

Among its assets, the country boasts five of the planet’s largest offshore wind farms, as reported by Electrek.

​​Neso predicts that within the next few months, Britain could achieve a new milestone by operating its electricity grid solely on zero-carbon sources, namely renewables and nuclear power.

“This new record high period is another tangible example of wind taking its place at the heart of our clean energy system, as we transition away from the volatile prices of fossil fuels, which caused the energy crisis,” Cooper added.

It aligns with the UK government’s wider, high-stakes objective, often referred to as the “clean power mission.” The government aims to generate at least 95% of the UK’s electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030, transitioning away from reliance on fossil fuels.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IE-16.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 06:58:00.082999

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop. When combined with new EV battery manufacturing, such as the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C., the state remains in the top four nationally for investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries.

Making clean energy work post-IRA

Amittay said the Inflation Reduction Act and its associated tax credits drove much of the growth that year. “Plenty of this growth would have happened regardless of the policy landscape.”

“Renewable generation continues to be a notch above the economy statewide,” he said. “What’s really kind of head and shoulders above statewide growth is storage and grid.”

That includes folks such as Charlotte-based Heimdall Power’s president, Brita Formato, who presented about her new powerline “neuron” during an E2 event last week in Charlotte. The device provides real-time data to utilities about their transmission line capacity:

“Using the infrastructure that we already have will bridge us to that 7-10 years that we need to build out the grid,” Formato said. In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.

Looking ahead, Amittay said he expects growth to continue, albeit more slowly.

“What we’re doing is leaving some potential for jobs on the table,” said Amittay, referring to changes in federal policy during the last year. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminated or greatly restricted federal incentives for solar installations and manufacturing.

This new political landscape has made renewable energy businesses in particular more sensitive to state and local changes. During this past legislative session, lawmakers removed a key carbon pollution reduction target and took aim at a tax abatement for utility-scale solar projects. Meanwhile, other initiatives, such as Duke Energy’s PowerPair and Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, have helped buoy rooftop solar sales into the first quarter of 2026.

He anticipates that grid and battery storage will continue growing rapidly.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45172ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1601x841+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2Fe7%2F73c6711e4879935414fe87089ecf%2Fe2plan-de-travail-44-copie.png,N,,2025-11-22 05:58:42.801249

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.
The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps.
These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit.","New England winters can get wicked cold. This week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead by burning fossil fuels.

“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”

The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.

New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.

“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.

The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.

The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.

The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.

These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”

Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.

Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.

The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.

The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.

The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.

The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.

Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.

“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2226699225.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4e11ebc6ea331ee3e8de5ab4df57a828,N,,2025-11-22 07:59:33.381852

The new biorefinery will be developed at an existing ethylene plant in Sicily Eni has stated that the plan involves developing the project at the current site of Versalis’ ethylene plant.
Diversifying the company’s energy portfolio will be the planned biogenic feedstock pretreatment unit and a hydrogen production facility.
The new project will also boast a chemical recycling facility that will make use of Versalis’ proprietary Hoop pyrolysis technology.","As the world aims to decarbonize the energy sector following years of harmful emissions devastating the environment, Eni, a major Italian energy company with assets across the world, has revealed that it has officially filed for approval from the Italian government to construct a new biorefinery and recycling complex in Sicily. This marks a major step in the company’s decarbonization plans and sets the stage for Eni to become a market leader in the production of biofuels for a variety of industries.

Sicily will become the home of European biofuel production thanks to Eni’s ambitious plans

As the world grapples with the transition from conventional energy resource production, such as oil and gas, to the new and exciting world of biofuel production, several exceedingly large energy companies have laid out their plans to expand existing operations or retrofit refineries to produce biofuels.

That has become especially true in Sicily, as Eni, one of Italy’s largest energy companies, has announced its plans to develop a 500,000-metric-ton-per-year biorefinery at its existing industrial site in Priolo, Sicily. The company notes that the facility will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel and is expected to be operational in 2028.

Eni has officially launched the authorization process for the environmental impact assessment to retrofit the facility in Sicily, and has received the blessing of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security to begin retrofitting the facility.

The new biorefinery will be developed at an existing ethylene plant in Sicily

Eni has stated that the plan involves developing the project at the current site of Versalis’ ethylene plant. Versalis is a subsidiary of Eni, which focuses on the production of chemicals. The company has stated that the ethylene plant will slowly be phased out and decommissioned to make room for the new biorefinery, marking a turning point for Eni’s vast energy portfolio.

The new facility will serve Eni’s biofuel ambitions as well as produce hydrogen

Eni has noted that the new facility will produce renewable diesel as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), all made from waste, animal fat, and vegetable oil feedstocks. Diversifying the company’s energy portfolio will be the planned biogenic feedstock pretreatment unit and a hydrogen production facility.

The new project will also boast a chemical recycling facility that will make use of Versalis’ proprietary Hoop pyrolysis technology. The all-new chemical recycling facility will have the capacity to process 40,000 metric tons per year of mixed plastic packaging waste, which will enable Eni to produce approximately 32,000 metric tons per year of pyrolysis oil.

Eni previously announced its plans to increase biorefinery capacity over the years to come

The company has stated its plans to increase the capacity of its biorefineries to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028, with ambitions to increase that number even more over the next few years. Other nations have also jumped on board the diversification train, such as Saudi Arabia, which recently revealed its plans to expand petrochemical production.

LITTLETON, Colorado, Nov 21 (Reuters) – A potent mix of American ingenuity and full-throated political backing has propelled the U.S. to the top of global LNG exporter rankings, and promoted a narrative that shipments of “freedom gas” will continue climbing to all markets for years to come.

But while U.S. liquefied natural gas exports in 2025 are nearly a third more than those of the next largest exporter, the heavy skew of sales to Europe leaves American LNG vendors at risk of rapid volume downturns as European buyers curb gas use.

The US has exported a record 98 million metric tons of LNG so far in 2025, or 25% of global LNG exports

Further, the U.S. share of exports into the largest region for LNG imports – Asia – is far smaller than rivals Qatar and Australia, which enjoy far more cost-effective shipping times to key markets such as Japan, China and India.

If the U.S. is to cement its role as the preeminent global supplier of LNG – often branded as freedom gas when pitched to allies as an alternative to supplies from authoritarian countries – export flows will need to grow sharply in key markets outside of Europe in areas where the likes of Qatar, Australia, Malaysia and Russia are already well established.

LNG imports by region since 2021

That heightened competition will severely test the U.S. ability to remain the top global LNG supplier, as it will lead to sharply higher transit costs for U.S. exporters and narrower profit margins as sellers compete for deals.

EURO CENTRIC

European nations have accounted for two-thirds of U.S. LNG exports this year, which is the highest concentration of U.S. export flows to a single continent since 2022, when Europe’s demand for LNG spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

And although Europe’s total LNG import volumes have jumped by 25% in 2025 from last year, Kpler data shows, Europe’s total LNG import needs have expanded by only 2% since 2022 as the power sector retooled generation sources away from fossil fuels.

Europe is by far the top destination for US LNG exports, accounting for two-thirds of US LNG shipments in 2025

With Europe’s utilities expected to continue fast-tracking renewables and battery storage deployment going forward, regional gas demand is likely to decline from the 2030s, resulting in a shrinking market for LNG exporters.

In its latest outlook, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts total European Union gas demand to decline by just over 10% by 2035 due to greater use of electric heat pumps, higher energy efficiencies and more renewables output.

FAR-FLUNG HEADWINDS

To offset shrinking volumes into Europe, U.S. LNG exporters will have to look farther afield, and may have to go head-to-head with other large LNG sellers to grow market share in Asia, which is the top overall LNG importing region.

But to sustainably grow volumes into cost-sensitive markets such as China and India, U.S. exporters may need to undercut rivals while also incurring higher transit costs on each delivery.

Roughly 26% of the LNG imported by the top 10 importers comes from the USA. But the US share is much higher into Europe than into Asia

So far in 2025, the U.S. share of LNG exports to the top five global LNG importers – Japan, China, South Korea, India and Taiwan – is just 8%, as other exporters such as Qatar and Australia hold far higher Asian market shares.

To grow that share, U.S. LNG will need to be cheaper than what’s being offered by other suppliers.

But lowering sale prices will be a challenge as the costs of delivering the LNG to Asian buyers stands to be over twice that of shipping LNG to mainland Europe.

The journey time for an LNG vessel from Sabine Pass in the U.S. to Rotterdam in the Netherlands is roughly 15 days, according to LSEG.

But the journey time from Sabine Pass to the Dahej port in India is over 30 days, and so marks a doubling in trip time as well as greater LNG boil off during the journey, which will eat into cargo revenues.

Lower sales prices combined with higher transit costs will not just erode profitability, but may also strain exporter creditworthiness as the lengthier journeys will tie up cash flows for longer and may necessitate short-term credit lines.

A pivot from mainly servicing cash-rich customers in Europe to soliciting demand from firms with weaker credit profiles in emerging markets will also raise the overall market risk for LNG exporters, and may lift the cost of credit lines accordingly.

TRADE TENSIONS

Aggressive moves by U.S. LNG exporters to grow market share in Asia could also strain trade ties with the likes of Qatar, which is heavily reliant on gas exports for national earnings and has plans to steeply boost its own LNG export volumes.

The US has an 8% average share of LNG trade into the top 5 LNG importers, and a 44% average share into the next 5 largest importers

Qatar has also pledged hefty investments in the U.S. over the coming decade – including in facilities that export LNG from the U.S. Gulf coast – and so could renege on those commitments if U.S. LNG export expansions are deemed too disruptive.

Canada, Russia, Australia, Mozambique and Mexico have also announced plans to lift LNG export volumes in the coming years, and so will also be vying for share in the same markets that U.S. exporters will be targeting.

Overall, more supplies from other exporters alongside higher delivery costs to new markets may slow U.S. LNG export growth going forward, and could force LNG exporters to settle for a smaller slice of the global LNG export pie over time.

Washington (November 21, 2025) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today wrote to President Trump to condemn the Administration’s reversal of progress towards ambitious domestic and international climate policy. The United States government has been noticeably absent from negotiations at COP30 in Brazil, the United Nations-hosted annual climate summit where government leaders, civil society, and academia convene to take stock of collective progress towards emissions reduction and climate resilience and chart forward new goals to address ongoing challenges. The Trump administration’s repeated attacks on climate and clean energy at home and abroad jeopardizes our relationships with our global allies, sacrifices American jobs and competitiveness, and leads the world into a race to the bottom.

Senator Markey writes, “As the countries of the world gather to fight climate catastrophe, you are courting it. Since the first day of your second Administration, when you ordered the United States to join the company of Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only non-participating parties to the Paris Agreement, you have undone decades of U.S. climate leadership on the global stage.”

Senator Markey continues, “As the international climate conference COP30 concludes in Brazil on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, I urge you to stop destroying our standing with international allies and turning collective climate action into a race to the bottom. Your attacks on our domestic clean energy industry and international aid are decimating our national ability to compete with China and other countries that are seizing the economic advantage of climate action.”

Senator Markey has been outspoken in his support for strong U.S. climate leadership on the international stage.

During COP29 in 2024, Senator Markey partnered with Representative Lisa Badum of Germany and Senator Rosa Galvez of Canada to lead more than 130 leaders from around the world in sending an open letter urging world leaders and UN-level negotiators to support an immediate moratorium on the expansion of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure worldwide.

In December 2023, Senator Markey and Representative Nydia Velasquez introduced the Climate Displaced Persons Act, legislation to enact a national strategy that would provide a more equitable immigration pathway to the United States for people displaced by climate change and critical support for people affected by climate disasters internationally.

Ahead of COP28 in 2023, Senator Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led 32 of their House and Senate colleagues in a letter to President Joe Biden urging the Administration to support stronger national climate action commitments to the Paris climate agreement, a negotiated outcome for a full phase-out of fossil fuels, and transparency and stronger standards to prevent public financing for international fossil fuel projects.

In a bid to stymie Delmarva, Ardencroft banned new transmission lines and towers last year, and approved an annual impact fee for existing transmission infrastructure.
Earlier this year, Ardentown formally entered the fray, prohibiting transmission towers and poles from exceeding 100 feet in height, with fines of $1,000 per day for violations.
Delmarva’s suit asked the court to invalidate Ardentown’s new laws and order the town to pay its legal bills.","What are journalists missing from the state of Delaware? What would you most like WHYY News to cover? Let us know.

Efforts by two tiny bucolic villages in northern Delaware to thwart Delmarva Power’s plan to replace high-voltage transmission lines have crumbled under a lawsuit filed by the state’s dominant electricity provider.

Ardentown and Ardencroft, whose roughly 500 residents live in a self-proclaimed

“forest ecosystem” of mature woodlands and open spaces known as “greens,” object to the looming replacement of seven tall metal towers, one more than 100 feet high, that were built a century ago on what was then farmland.

The existing towers traverse about a half-mile of mostly hilly terrain through the two towns, with some located between the backyard of homes in a Delmarva right-of-way. Their replacement with galvanized steel structures designed to withstand hurricane-force winds is part of Delmarva’s 4.5-mile upgrade that’s aimed at improving reliability service for 13,000 customers while reducing the frequency and duration of outages.

But the village’s governing assemblies contend the project will tarnish the lush enclave by clear-cutting trees and disrupting lead-contaminated soil beneath the towers. They want the project rerouted about a quarter-mile away, near railroad tracks where Delmarva already has some towers. WHYY News detailed the controversy in January.

In a bid to stymie Delmarva, Ardencroft banned new transmission lines and towers last year, and approved an annual impact fee for existing transmission infrastructure. In March, the town sent Delmarva a $12,833.17 impact fee bill for 2025.

Earlier this year, Ardentown formally entered the fray, prohibiting transmission towers and poles from exceeding 100 feet in height, with fines of $1,000 per day for violations. Ardentown also banned new transmission lines or tower infrastructure of 60 kilovolts or more within 100 feet of any home, with fines of $1,500 per day for violations.

Delmarva’s existing lines and towers, both Ardentown ordinances said, have “caused almost 100 years of unnecessary harm and avoidable risk to our village.”

In response to the villages’ laws and fees, Delmarva fired back on Oct. 31 against Ardentown — but not Ardencroft — in Delaware’s Chancery Court, which is recognized internationally for its ability to resolve business and corporate disputes.

Delmarva’s suit asked the court to invalidate Ardentown’s new laws and order the town to pay its legal bills. The 27-page filing accused the town of exceeding its legislative authority by violating the village’s 1926 contract with predecessor American Power Company that allows the lines, the Delaware Public Service Commission’s authority to regulate utilities and Delmarva’s constitutional property rights.

“The 1926 Ardentown Easement does not limit the height of the towers/poles located in the Ardentown Easement Area, nor does it limit the voltage carried by the transmission lines,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit added that the easement “gives Delmarva Power, among other things, the right to ‘repair and renew said poles, towers, structures, fixtures, and wires.’”

None of the current towers are higher than 100 feet, according to the lawsuit, but all of the proposed ones are, and the law was only enacted after Delmarva shared details of its “long-planned improvements” with town leaders.

“At their core, the ordinances are nothing more than a ‘not in my backyard’ attempt to force Delmarva Power to re-route its existing transmission line away from Ardentown and through other communities,” the lawsuit said.

Noting that the project’s completion deadline is the end of 2026, the lawsuit said that failing to finish by then “risks real-time operational reliability problems, including outages to a large number of customers or higher energy costs to customers.”

‘Trying to go up against Delmarva is quite, quite difficult’

Delmarva did not sue Ardencroft, which rescinded its ordinance in October to avoid litigation.

Minutes for that Ardenroft Assembly meeting noted the “general disappointment and frustration that everyone feels about this litigious outcome.”

And this month, 10 days after the lawsuit was filed, Ardentown also rescinded its two laws.

Ardentown trustee Lisa Wilson Riblett described the fight as a valiant but uphill battle for the “tree huggers” of the town, whose municipal budget is $22,500 a year, against the powerful subsidiary of Exelon Corp., a Fortune 500 conglomerate that had $23 billion in revenue and $2.46 billion in net income in 2024.

“The town did decide to rescind those ordinances because of just the financial burden of them,” Wilson Riblett said. “Unfortunately that doesn’t mean the problems are solved.”

Wilson Riblett said the utility still hasn’t provided detailed plans, including any tree replacement that’s needed.

She also pointed out that Delmarva must remediate the lead contamination under an agreement with state environmental officials and restrict the scope of their work to the width of the easement, which is as narrow as 8 feet in some stretches of the half-mile swatch through Ardentown and Ardencroft.

“Trying to go up against Delmarva when you’re a little tiny village is quite, quite difficult,” Wilson Riblett said. “But the people in the town are very proactive and they’re still working toward trying to make this the best situation that we can.”

Melissa Parsonson, Ardentown’s chair and effectively its unpaid mayor, said residents had little choice but to capitulate and rescind the laws. Otherwise, the town would put the approximately 270 residents in jeopardy of having to pay any damages, including the cost of litigation.

“There’s the risk of going to court and you don’t know how a judge is going to decide,” Parsonson said. “It’s very frustrating.”

Delmarva officials would not agree to be interviewed about the project, but said in a written statement from spokesman Matthew Ford that the utility is anticipating notification from Ardentown that the laws are no longer on the books.

“We are continuing to work closely with customers and communities to minimize impacts and keep them informed throughout this project,” Ford’s statement said. “We are pleased that the village has since withdrawn the ordinances, and we appreciate their decision, which allows us to move forward collaboratively in serving our customers and communities.”

Parsonson countered that Delmarva has been less than forthcoming, but said she hopes they will be more candid going forward.

“They haven’t told us anything,” she said. “They could bring in trucks tomorrow and we wouldn’t be none the wiser, because they just have not been open with us.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/delmarva-power-c-barrish-2025-11-19-4.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 02:57:56.943665

Summary

AI Data Centers Boom: The U.S. is spending more on data centers than on commercial construction, driving a new phase of infrastructure growth.

Energy Demand Surges: AI is the most energy-intensive form of computing, pushing grid demand to record levels and requiring massive new power generation.

Skilled Trades Shortage: The construction of data centers, factories, and infrastructure is creating a huge demand for electricians, plumbers, truck drivers, and other skilled workers.

Shift in Labor Market: AI threatens white-collar jobs, while blue-collar and technical trades see rising wages and job opportunities.

Grid and Transmission Challenges: Delivering enough energy—especially through new transmission lines and pipelines—is a major hurdle, with permitting and construction slowdowns.

Rising Utility Costs: Electric rates are increasing, driven largely by policy choices such as shutting down low-cost plants and subsidizing intermittent renewables.

Private Sector Solutions: Tech giants are building or funding their own off-grid power plants to meet data center needs and avoid overburdening public utilities.

U.S. Competitive Edge: America leads in data center capacity and AI infrastructure, thanks to abundant energy and technological know-how.

Political and Economic Risks: Policy missteps, regulatory delays, or global shocks (black swans) could disrupt the AI-driven economic boom.

Structural Economic Revolution: The convergence of AI, reshoring, and automation signals not just an industrial revolution, but a fundamental transformation of the entire U.S. economy.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Welcome, everyone. I am speaking with Mark Mills today. He's Executive Director for the National Center for Energy Analytics. And Mark, I wanted to have you back on the program. You recently wrote an article called ""The Rise of AI: The Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts."" I'd like to begin—I think it was a statement that we are spending more money on data centers than we are on commercial construction.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, I mean, it's really quite remarkable. That report's available at our National Center for Energy Analytics website. It's a free report; we don't—NCA is a nonprofit energy think tank. We don't charge for stuff; we just harvest donors to help us do our work. So, it's some interesting things going on. I've been involved in the data center industry for a long time and was on the board of a company that designed power systems for data centers for quite a while in the first era of the great data center build-out. America has been building data centers since 1998. The very first data center was built in Santa Clara, California, by Exodus Communications, which went bankrupt shortly after the great dot-com Internet bubble burst in 2000. But that's when it began. We've been building for 20-plus years, and now we're in the next phase of the great data center build-out, largely because of AI, but not exclusively because of AI. So, the country was spending billions of dollars a year constructing buildings the size of warehouses and shopping malls that are full of computers—data centers. That's where your magic Google Maps lives; that's where shopping exists; that's where you store your cat videos. The data centers are the beating heart of the global cloud and the Internet that we all use, both in business and in life. That's where streaming videos come from—that's where Netflix and Amazon Prime reside. That's where the data resides, in hardware—physical hardware. So now, with what's going on with this boom that's happened because of AI—and it's the most energy-hungry form of compute ever invented—data center construction this year in dollar terms blew past total construction of all office buildings in spending terms. Now, partly, office building construction slowed down a bit at the same time as data center construction took off. So, yeah, it's a—keep in mind that for those who are power nerds, energy nerds, a square foot of data center is roughly 10 times more energy-intensive than a square foot of office building.

Jim Puplava:

You know, something that you wrote in that article really struck me, and Mike Rowe talks about this—the need for skilled workers from electricians, plumbers, welders, things of that nature, and the amount of individuals needed to build a data center. It's remarkable. And you think of the data centers, you think of the new factories they're bringing back, the commercial buildings, not to mention residential buildings, which—where are we going to get all these people?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it's a giant boom in demand for the skilled trades. It's really crazy. So, as I wrote in that piece—and as soon as you say it, it's self-evident, right? Whether you're building a shipyard or a skyscraper, whether you're building a data center, a new factory to make chips, a highway, you're essentially tapping the same labor pool. These are truck drivers, electricians, plumbers, pipe fitters. It's all the things you need to move concrete, steel, and iron—to join things. It's very similar, and if it's not exactly the same, it's the same people. The number of people you need per billion dollars is remarkably constant across all these spaces. If you spend a billion dollars building something, you're going to need 5,000 to 7,000 skilled tradesmen to do it—whether it's a highway, a skyscraper, or a data center. And it's the same skilled trades. So yes, I think we have a massive boom in demand for skilled trades because of the appetite to reshore, because of data center expansion, and geopolitical concerns to start building ships here again. Where are we going to get the labor? Well, the question answers itself. People will figure out these are high-paying jobs. You do apprenticeships for a few years, you can get in at the ground level, you can earn twice the salary compared to more than half of college graduates. It's starting to come back, but we will face a—we already are facing a near-term shortage. How will it get filled? Well, again, it's a fairly fast cycle. But the other thing that will happen as wages rise and demand rises is that we will finally see the stimulant we need for more industrial automation. That's been very difficult to get into the construction sector. Those technologies, which by the way are also AI-infused and AI-enabled robots—to be simplistic, whether wheeled, tracked, or walking—that's coming. That's not theoretical anymore. It's another sort of nascent boom that everybody will look at, I'll say, three years from now and say, ""Gee, where did that come from?"" Well, it's—we need labor. We need to amplify the labor we've got.

Jim Puplava:

You know, the thing that really strikes me when I read that article—the Wall Street Journal just did an article—it's going to be the worst job market for graduating college students next year. And I was thinking about this, Mark, you know, the globalization where we outsourced our factories overseas, it really hit, you know, blue-collar workers.

Mark Mills:

Yeah.

Jim Puplava:

Now with AI, it's going to hit white-collar workers. And then blue-collar workers, with the demand for the trades to build all this stuff, their prospects are looking brighter.

Mark Mills:

Oh, no question. I mean, I wrote a piece about Mondaire Jones before we won the mayoral race in New York, pointing out the obvious that you just pointed out—that the voting class, and to put it unkindly, the laptop class in Manhattan who graduated with college degrees that were, to be unkind, marginally useful. I mean, these are not stupid people—I'm not denigrating them—but the degrees they got were of marginal value. That's exactly the kind of jobs that are being displaced, of course, by AI. So, they're feeling very nervous and anxious. This was collectively a political class that lectured the blue-collar class during the 1920s to 1960s when automation reduced the need for labor in the automotive and steel industries—that they should get over it and get retrained because automation and productivity were great for the economy, as it displaced the number of blue-collar jobs needed per unit of output, which it did by a lot. Now the shoe's on the other foot, as they say, and nobody likes it. It's politically disruptive. I'm not underplaying how politically volatile this is in the short term. In the long term, as they say, we've seen this movie before—the net-net effect is more jobs and more wealth. But in the short term, it does create disruption and realignment of where job opportunities lie. Then to your point, Jim, the boom in job opportunities is not just in blue-collar, but we'll call them the intermediate jobs. Most of the jobs in construction are not on the front line, like in war-fighting; most of the warfighters are not the guys at the so-called tip of the spear. It's everything in between the tip of the spear and the back office—all the infrastructure jobs. So these are real jobs that don't involve carrying a hammer or welding something, but they're in the construction industries. So that's where the boom's going to be. And again, you don't have to be trained as an electrician to get jobs there, but you have to decide that's an industry you want to work in instead of, say, finance or being in a law firm. And where those jobs are—very, very quickly, those intermediate jobs are already being rapidly automated away by AI.

Jim Puplava:

I want to get into your article about the energy requirements to put in all these data centers you mentioned. Probably in the next five years, that's probably going to come mainly from natural gas; five years out, then we start getting into nuclear. But where are we going to get all the energy? I'm talking about the grid. So, if you are doing, for example, renewable energy, where vast swaths of land for wind turbines or solar panels—you’re going to have to have some kind of transmission link to bring that power to the city. So where's all this going to come from?

Mark Mills:

Well, that's the big question of this decade, right? Because the surprise is at the magnitude of demand from data centers. To put it in context, for people who haven't really thought about this a lot, they hear the words thrown around—gigawatt of this, what's a gigawatt? Well, a gigawatt power plant is a pretty big power plant. It's like a nuclear plant or a big coal plant, a massive wind array. A gigawatt is huge—goes to the horizon. But that's about a half-million people; it's a city of a half-million people, one gigawatt. So it's a lot of power. And we're building right now, based on construction permits, we're building 76 gigawatts of data centers. That's what's permitted—whether they all get built or not, we'll see, but about 76. So, do the math, right? That's adding a city of 30 million people, which the United States doesn't have one of those. I mean, well, LA, I guess, greater area is 30 million. So it's adding, you know, five or six New York cities' worth of electric demand. So, where are we going to get it? Well, okay, the two parts of it are: how do you get the primary energy? That's why I said natural gas. It's a very significant but achievable increase in natural gas demand—about 10 or 15% more natural gas will be needed compared to what we currently produce. This is not that hard to do, really. You need more pipelines, but that's not that hard to do. It's the conversion of the gas into electricity, to your point, and delivering it to the data center. So, the data centers will be sited closer to where the power plants are first. That's what's happening already. If you need to build long transmission lines, good luck. Transmission line construction is at epic low levels—very difficult to expand quickly. Even if there were no permitting problems, there are a lot of problems getting these big long-distance transmission lines permitted. Just from an engineering perspective, to give you a framing of how the market's going to play out—if you want to build 500 miles of transmission line, you're looking at, ignoring permits, two to four years to do that. If you want to build 500 miles of natural gas pipelines to deliver energy to the endpoint and make electricity there instead, you're talking 24 to 30 months. So you get two years versus four years. So which would you do? I mean, obviously, you'll build gas pipes and put the power plants at the end of the pipe. So that's how the architecture is starting to play out, both with utilities and non-utilities. We saw Meta announce a big project with a gas pipeline company, Williams, in Pennsylvania to build a data center and gas generation off-grid—not connected to electric utility at all. You see in Louisiana, Meta do a different version of their plan, which is to work with the utility there, Entergy, to prepay for, in effect, the capacity needs. So the utility didn't have any trouble raising capital because the capital came from big tech and it didn't impact ratepayers. And they're going to build two gigawatts of capacity for one data center. Think about this—a data center with a million people's worth of electric demand, and it'll get built in two years. You don't build a city in two years, but you can build a city's worth of electric demand in two years. This is a distinction with a profound difference with respect to how this whole market's going to play out.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because, I mean, AI stocks have dominated the stock market the last two years. I think tech stocks are about 40% of the market cap in the S&P, and even more so in the Nasdaq. But nobody's looking at what you're addressing—which is, where are we going to get the energy, the transmission lines to make all this possible? The other thing I want to bring up here is we've spent a lot of money on the Green New Deal, solar farms, wind farms, and things like that. Let's talk about what that is doing to the cost of electricity, because I want to get into the recent elections, which were all about affordability. I want to go to New Jersey. New Jersey utility rates are up 26% in the last 12 months alone.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, yeah, you can't blame data centers for that—although people are trying to. The data centers aren't finished yet; most of them are under construction. So how do they cause electric rates to go up when they haven't consumed the electricity yet? They will consume electricity when they get built. I'm being only slightly facetious. In a few cases you can trace some of the electric rate increases to data centers, in a few—very few—cases. The primary reason electric rates are going up is bad policies. And the bad policies devolve to two things: shutting down existing low-cost electric generation—some of it's nuclear, but a lot of it's coal. And so, as you know, this administration has ordered this cessation, and many states have also ordered cessation. Many utilities have voluntarily stopped shutting down low-cost big coal plants because we need more power, not less. So, doing that—a lot of that's already happened—raised rates. Pushing onto grids by mandate—subsidized use of episodic power, wind and solar—causes electricity costs to go up, even if the electricity from the sun and the wind, when it's being supplied, is cheap, which it is. When it's not available, you have to depend on the rest of the grid, which is now run suboptimally. And that suboptimization of the grid means electric rates go up, which is what happened. This was predictable, it was predicted, and now we're harvesting the consequences. And this is politically volatile because affordability is one thing politicians do not like. Having experienced self-inflicted inflation is to have inflation come back in energy and in the electric side—it is coming back.

Jim Puplava:

And you don't hear any of these arguments in the media. You know, they're already talking about big tech companies building these data centers. But some of these tech companies—a good example is Microsoft and a couple of others—I think they're working with a decommissioned nuclear plant, so they're bringing it back. So, do you see a lot of these companies realizing, hey, we're not going to be able to get the power, so let us take this on our own? Like what Elon Musk did in Virginia—I think he put in two power plants to build his data center. I know Meta is doing that in Louisiana, and as you mentioned, they're doing it in Pennsylvania. Do you see more of that, to maybe take some of the pressure off them so they won't be the, you know, the scapegoat for this?

Mark Mills:

Well, I think they have no choice. First of all, you're going to see a blend of different solutions depending on the geography and politics of each state and what they have. But the blend will always devolve to the pressure to the people demanding the power—big tech paying for their power. So, sort of bring your own money, not just bring your own power. They have a lot of money. I think they are very sensitive to the politics of this, and they're not—these are not stupid people. So, when you're a utility, you need to expand capacity, which costs money, which increases rates. You're going to look to the proximate reason for that to pay for it. Now, whether that is you bring your own power plant and build it off-grid, whether that's you pay for the power plant preemptively by refurbishing an old one or paying the utility to build a new one, whatever the mechanism is, there will, I think, be a lot of pressure on the demand side—that is, the data centers—to offset these costs themselves rather than having the ratepayers pay for that. We've already seen that. In a few cases, public service commissions have reversed decisions made by utilities to build power for a data center on the ratepayers' back, to say you're not going to do that. And the PJM region, which is the big grid operator from Chicago to New York, they've sent a very clear signal out that if you want this kind of power demand, you're going to have to find a way to not only just cover the cost of electricity, but also cover the cost of reliability.

Jim Puplava:

What about—let's talk about utilities for a minute. If you look at until AI and EVs came about—originally they were worried about EVs and what that would do—but utilities' growth was about maybe a half a percent a year. Now they're growing at close to 3% a year. I think this came as a big shock to the utility industry, and I don't know if they were prepared for it.

Mark Mills:

No, they weren't. In a moment of self-promotion, I will point out that I've spoken at utility meetings—for the last 15 years—making the claim that the interregnum of flat load growth would end. And it would end for two reasons. We would not be able to harvest any more efficiency gains—mostly efficiency gains in electric growth were a one-time thing. You know, going from regular light bulbs to LEDs—it's a one-time gain. They can't keep doing that over and over again. And we would go from an era of minimal demand growth—modest economic growth, new technologies—to more demand growth from, to your point, not just EVs but reshoring factories, getting general economies to grow, and now data centers. These are all predictable things. Now, utilities' mindset—and this is painting with a broad brush; there is a lot of diversity in the hundreds of utilities out there, as you know—there's hundreds of electric utilities, investor-owned, co-ops, and public powers. So there's a lot of diversity of intellectual opinion and skills, let's just say. But painting with a broad brush, the industry has been locked into a no-growth mentality—to your point, half percent or less—while also simultaneously locked into a replacement mentality. That is, we can shut down hydrocarbon plants—gas plants and coal plants—and replace them with episodic power plants—wind and solar—by harvesting subsidies from the government, the federal government largely, and some state governments. You could get away with that during a no-growth period, up to a point. And the point ends when you can't keep grids reliable without spending more money. Episodic power is unreliable inherently, and that happens simultaneously with growth. So, it's a long way of saying that you're absolutely right, Jim. They were not prepared for this. The mindset and the operational strategy of a lot of utilities was essentially managing a no-growth period and a ""transition"" away from traditional power generation. Now, what they're in is an era coming back to—I'll call it ""team reality."" We have growth and the need for additions, not replacements or transitions. We're not going to get rid of windmills and we're going to build lots more of them. I mean, the one big beautiful bill—the OBB as it's called—did not eliminate subsidies, it cut them back and put a time period. But there's going to be a lot more windmills and solar arrays built to harvest the credits that are still left after the OBB passed. And they're going to be integrated into the grid one way or the other. The trick now is to figure out how to do that without compromising either reliability or affordability. And that's going to take some fancy footwork—let's just put it that way.

Jim Puplava:

I almost call this, Mark, the perfect storm for energy. You have demand coming from EVs, you have demand coming from reshoring all these factories we're going to bring back, and then you throw AI and the cloud on top of all three hitting the energy market at the same time.

Mark Mills:

So here's the challenge. You know what happens when demand outruns supply—this is your, I'm talking in your business, your métier—prices go up. So, then we normally say, well, a market will respond. If you raise the price of something, businesses will respond and harvest that higher revenue. But now you're talking about a regulated industry, where there's consumers who do not want prices to go up and the politicians that impact industry do not want higher-priced electricity. So this is the collision—the challenge, the fancy footwork I'm talking about. You're absolutely right. Everybody wants to reshore. Lots of people love EVs. EVs are great, by the way; I just don't subsidize them. Millions more are going to be bought because they're great, great fun, a lot of utility value, and so forth. And markets want AI. We know that because the demand for AI products is soaring. Never mind that the reason they're being built is not because of mandates—there's no subsidies to build data centers for AI. What's happening is the consumers—that is, both businesses and individuals—are using and buying the products and services that AI is enabling. So there's a huge tailwind for all three vectors you described, never mind politicians and subsidies. But it's running headlong into this challenge of demand outstripping supply, which stimulates higher prices, which will just crash right into the affordability politics.

Jim Puplava:

You know, how does this work? We know utilities are a very capital-intensive business. So if they have to build new power plants, expand the grid, transmission lines, that's going to take capital—a lot of money. If our politicians are hammering the utilities as the reason people's utility rates are going up and they limit them, where are they going to get the money? How's this going to work if they hammer the utilities and make them the boogeyman?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, well, I would say there isn't an infinite supply of capital, but the supply of dry powder, as they say in that industry—infrastructure fund capital globally that would love to invest in America—is enormous. There's trillions of dollars of capital looking to invest in exactly this kind of thing. In the United States, we're still the best place to deploy that kind of capital in terms of reliability of the broader market economy. There are going to have to be creative solutions. And the creative solutions will be at the two ends of the spectrum. One is, some of it will get built off-grid—just fully off-grid. The money, because the data centers need to be built, you build power plants to run the data center itself, isolated from the grid, and therefore the service will go into the Internet, the magic cloud. But it won't consume electricity from the common pool and raise rates. That's one solution. The other solution is that the data center companies themselves offset those costs when the utility builds the power plants. Because utilities are very good at building power plants and distributing power—they've been doing it for well over a century. We're one and a half centuries into the utility industry. Nothing is different about it structurally now than it's ever been. They know how to do this. They're just going to have to be very creative about who pays. So, some of that can be done through artful accounting, but it always devolves to that old question: who pays? And the goal will be to have legal structures, regulatory contracts, that result in the consumer not paying. That's what's going to have to happen. I just don't see any get-out-of-jail card on this. I mean, modest increases, sure. You know what politicians and public service commissions do? They'll cut a deal that says—and this is because they don't care about the future—politicians are going to have to face this. The deal will be, we'll pay for it, we the utility, and what the public service commission will give them is a rate increase of 1.5% or 2% or something de minimis. Now, that will ratchet up over the next decade or two decades. Well, if you’ve got a regulatory ratchet built in, you can take that to the bank—literally—and finance that. The problem is, five, ten years out when electric rates then have to start to follow the ratchet, the politicians in that future are going to be very unhappy with the politicians of the past that cut that deal. But those are the kinds of deals that have been cut before in the utility industry, and they'll be cut again. And to be philosophically cynical, it's not a bad way to do it. If what we get is an economic boom from AI—and that's what I, as you know, predict in my book—then the people of the future will be richer than us in the present. They can afford the higher rates. I mean, that's the nature of the beast.

Jim Puplava:

What about, I mean, you know, we talk about these three forces that are creating all this demand for energy and electricity. I've seen where some of the big companies are even talking about locating AI data centers in the Middle East. We had the Saudi prince at the White House, and all the tech titans were there for dinner. So what are the chances that you may see that, maybe to relieve some of the pressure here and the availability of electricity, to go to the Middle East?

Mark Mills:

That's already happening, as you say. I mean, everybody—firstly, building a gigawatt-scale data center is now sort of a sign of modernity and status. So, we're going to see a lot of that. Just like a lot of countries want to have their own automobile industry because it's a sign of modernity and status, even though the world gets oversupplied with cars, generally speaking. So you'll see that. There's two problems with that, at the macro level. There have been lots of data centers everywhere. The United States is building about 75% right now of all the new data centers—they're being built in the United States. United States already has 70%—if you measure compute power in FLOPS, you know, floating logic operations per second—the United States has 70-plus percent of the world's compute power. The continental United States—something like half of the global Internet traffic flows physically through the United States. So, the epicenter is here. And it's here not because energy is relatively cheap here—cheaper than most places; the only place that's cheaper is China and the Middle East. China because they like coal power, built lots of coal plants and they're building lots more; and here because we got there early and we have cheap primary energy, especially natural gas and earlier on, coal. So, you'll see some more of this. But by and large, it's going to be here because the skills are here, the epicenter's here, the technology is here. The other issue, of course, is how the AI is used. So if the AI—you've probably heard some of the progenitors of AI start to use this nomenclature—they're not calling these data centers anymore; they're calling them ""AI factories."" It's a building in which we fabricate a large language model that will make pretty pictures, like the new Gemini 3 from Google, or will answer semantic questions in natural language. So we have to build the model. Once the model's built, the model can run lots of other places. Well, you can build those models anywhere. But the problem with that is that most of the value in building the model—and most of the energy used—is in using the model, not building it. And when you use the model, generally, distance is not your friend. So, the speed of light turns out to be a problem, even though it may seem like it's very fast. As a physicist, I'll tell you, the speed of light's very fast, but it's the fastest thing that we think exists in the universe. But information moves close to the speed of light. But speed of light means that if you want fast things—control systems and automation—you can't have the data centers' inference and logic more than, typically, if it's financial transactions, it's dozens of miles; if it's other kinds of transactions, maybe 100, 200 miles; you have to be very close to the activity. So the speed of light actually turns out to be a limiting factor for a lot of things that you want to use data for—you can't put it too far away. So there'll be stuff going on for those countries for their own need for data centers, because everybody's going to need a data center. They're everywhere now. Give or take, there are 8,000 data centers in the world, roughly. There are 5,000 in the United States. So, the world has a lot of them too. We'll build lots more. They're in Russia, they're in China, they're in Myanmar. People have only recently, because of AI, discovered the phrase ""data center,"" the technical term. But it's not new. We're in—I guess if I'm thinking of a better analogy—we're in the second phase of the build-out of a great revolution.

Jim Puplava:

So, when you take a look at this, there are people that are questioning, ""Oh, we're spending all this money—I mean massive amounts of money."" Even the tech companies have found a way to finance this; they're issuing debt. So what about profitability?

Mark Mills:

So right now, based on, you know, I'm just going on data from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs and the Bank of America analysts—so the Magnificent Seven are spending about 30 to 40% of their cash flow on capex. So they're still way below spending all their cash flow. So even though there's a lot of debt in the mix, as a share of cash flow, it's below total cash flow. So the question answers itself—they're still minting a lot of money. They're not consuming more than they're producing. And the marginal value of AI generating more cash flow is what they're counting on. Obviously, they're expecting that hundreds of billions being deployed will generate revenues. So I'll give you a sort of order-of-magnitude number: the global cloud services data centers generate these software-as-a-service in the cloud. So the total market for global cloud services—that is, the businesses and consumers buying services in the cloud—is approaching a trillion dollars a year of spending right now. A trillion a year, and it'll rise to about 2 trillion a year, based on old models—that is, pre-AI models. So you could ask yourself this just macro question: How much money would an industry spend on capex per year to harvest a trillion-dollar per year market consuming the products that the capex serves? Well, you could spend half of it and not be crazy in a growth phase. I mean, a lot of investors would like to harvest all the profits, of course, but as a business, you're trying to capture future profits. That's what this game is. So, we're sort of in a growth phase where everybody's trying to guess how much we have to spend now to stimulate more growth, and how much of that share of growth—increased cloud revenues—each player is going to get. There are going to be winners and losers. Some people will get out over their skis and spend too much; some won't spend enough and they'll lose market share and disappear. But, macro, U.S. big tech—Magnificent Seven—are well below collectively spending half of their cash flow on capex. So, I mean, I'm not a financial wizard like you are, Jim, but I don't think that's the crisis. I don't think that's a problem. I think that's probably quasi-rational.

Jim Puplava:

How do you see all of this coming together and changing the shape of the economy? You know, we're talking about robotics, we're talking about reshoring, and now AI. How do you see that changing? I was talking to a doctor, client, and friend, and he was saying he sees, like, a radiologist could maybe be phased out because it'll just go to AI and analyze the X-rays.

Mark Mills:

Yeah. So, the big answer to the question is: read my book ""The Cloud Revolution,"" because that's why I wrote the book. It came out just before ChatGPT came on the market, but a third of the book is about AI, and I addressed the answer to the question of what's going to happen to different parts of our economy—to manufacturing, to education, to entertainment, to transportation. AI is fundamentally a productivity tool. The reason markets use it is because it makes things more productive. If it didn't, it wouldn’t be used. Entertainment is a separate issue but it's a form of productivity. And so I'm very bullish on what this means for the economy at large as it's democratized, which has implications of all kinds, but the bottom line—sort of underlying it all—it's very productive. And that productivity feature, just to give you an example, just arithmetically—if it were the case, as you know, the United States is in a productivity deficit. The productivity growth rate, which drives everything in the economy, is running about half of the long-run average since World War II. If AI can restore our productivity growth rate just to the long-run average, never mind beyond it—which I think it will do; I think it'll take it up to old highs—but let's just say it did the long-run average. So, we're running at a 1.4% per year productivity growth rate. Long-run average is about 2.2. Peak periods, we had 3 to 4% productivity growth rate. Now, this doesn't sound like a lot, but as you know, compound averages really kick in here. If we restore to the long-run average over the next decade, the U.S. economy will harvest a cumulative $10 trillion more wealth than we would otherwise have. Ten trillion! I mean, that's free money in a sense, right? The economy will be $10 trillion—cumulative—bigger. That has a lot of implications for health care, Social Security, for people fighting over limited money—everything. It also has implications for energy demand, because a wealthier economy consumes more energy. In fact, I think that's the biggest energy event. Roughly speaking, I calculated, back-of-the-envelope, that the energy demand induced by a wealthier economy over the next decade will be 20 times bigger than the energy needed to fuel the AI that creates the bigger economy. So, the real energy demand that's going to come from this is a bigger economy. But the question you asked—a specific one—will it kill jobs? Well, of course it will kill some jobs. That's the whole point of productivity. Productivity is intended to reduce inputs to get the same outputs. That means less labor, less material. That's the point of it. That's been the point of it for centuries. This is not new. What's new is that we finally get some productivity coming back in the economy. What's always worrisome, though, about productivity-driven job disruptions—we've been there many times in history—is they're politically volatile too, because there are always winners and losers. I'm not downplaying the political challenges. We have more tools to deal with them now—not just unemployment and retraining, and we're wealthy. But in a weird way, the AI itself is a tool that can ameliorate the job disruption effects, because AI itself allows new skills and new training and upskilling much faster than old ways of retraining and upskilling. So, it's going to be both complicated and ugly, but it's not an apocalypse. The idea that—I'll give you one specific example: the classic automation tool, the ATM—automated teller machines. The apocryphal story is, it got rid of the bank teller, and that's what's going to happen—AI on steroids. Okay, I agree. It's going to be just like the ATM machine, but—except that the data, according to the Census Bureau, tell a different story. From the early 1980s, when ATMs started coming into the game, the number of ATMs in the market in the United States is 800% greater than in 1980. How about bank tellers? There are 20% more bank tellers in the United States now than there were in 1980. Not zero, not 20% less—more. Now, the number of bank tellers did not grow as fast as it did in the previous 40 years—gee, what a shock. So, the story will repeat itself. That's the more common AI story. AI will do to most jobs what automated teller machines did to the teller business. It changed the character of what most tellers do. You know, dispersing cash was what a lot of tellers spent their time doing. They don't do much of that anymore. Most people go to an ATM or use Zelle or Venmo, right?

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. The thing that really strikes me, I guess from a positive point of view, I'm taking a look at the demand for blue-collar jobs that are going to be needed—whether you're building factories, building AI centers, not to mention commercial and residential buildings. So, the blue-collar person with higher wages—because when you don't have enough of them, what happens? Wages go up to attract people to the industry. So, that's positive. And then, you know, you take a look at reshoring, robotics—all these kind of things that we're bringing back—it's like a great industrial renaissance.

Mark Mills:

All right, listen, I'm bullish on this.

Jim Puplava:

I'm not.

Mark Mills:

I mean, I'm not a Pollyanna, naive about negatives and hard times and disruptions in the politics—the Mandami class really being unhappy about the disruption. I mean, I get all that.

Jim Puplava:

I'm not.

Mark Mills:

Nor am I naive about the fact that economic flourishing doesn't mean we end wars. Anybody that studies history knows that the state of an economy and the prospects for wars are not correlated in any particular way. Wars happen because bad things happen. But you're right—this is a renaissance. But here's the language error: we all use analogies because analogies help us understand. So, we talk about this as an Industrial Revolution, the fourth Industrial Revolution, whatever. It's not an industrial revolution—it's everything. Industry is part of the economy. It's a very important part of the economy, and it will cause revolutionary impacts in industry. But it's a structural revolution in the economy, which is really a very different beast than the Industrial Revolution. And in fact, it's much more important and far-reaching than just the Industrial Revolution. As consequential as the Industrial Revolution was, this is bigger. I think it's—and it's happening at a point in time when we need it, because of demographics, to your point, because of inflationary pressures. There are all kinds of features that can be addressed by this class of revolution. So, we use the word ""industry"" because it's a generic term. But obviously, many of the jobs that are being amplified by AI are not industrial jobs, right? They're information sector jobs or service sector jobs, they're transportation jobs. In fact, the hardest thing to automate has been industry. We went through a great eruption—to use Carlotta Perez's term—of automation in manufacturing with the Industrial Revolution, from steam and electrification and motors and control systems. And that brought productivity gains which have not been matched in all of history. I mean, the number of labor hours needed to make a car or a ton of steel went down fourfold—not 40%, fourfold. Now, AI hasn't done anything close to that yet. But if it does—and I think it will—across the various markets, it will do exactly the same thing as happened last time. It'll be a massive tailwind for the economy, contemporaneous with some very consequential social and political challenges. And we're seeing the hints of some of that already. Again, back to the Mondaire Jones vote—that's in the Bernie Sanders wing of the political class, where they rail against the oligarchs who make these businesses and technologies, the robber barons. That all began during the great Industrial Revolution, as you know, of the so-called robber baron age. And the idea of a robber baron, that phrase was coined by the people who hated the big industrialists—not because they weren't making things better or cheaper for people—but because they had a lot of power, economic and political power. And it created a reaction. And this is, you know, so we're in the same kind of world, which promoted my book again, where I pointed out what was going on in the 1920s. We were at the same kind of conflict from 1900 through the 1920s for very much the same reasons.

Jim Puplava:

You know, I should have you back on the program just to discuss that book. It was very prescient. I mean, you wrote that—what was it, '22 you wrote that?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it came out—January was really, it was released right at the beginning of the year '21, but '22 was right on the cusp of ChatGPT showing up on the landscape. But yeah, no, it was prescient. Thank you, Jim, but only because I, as I put in the book, I only predicted stuff that already happened.

Jim Puplava:

Well, let me throw this one on. Given all these scenarios, what would be a black swan event that could maybe be overlooked, that nobody is seeing that could come out of the blue? And then, you know, I think of the financial crisis that we went through in 2007 and 2008—mortgages, real estate, the financial market was going, and then all of a sudden, boom, something hit. Can you think of anything in the back of your mind that might disrupt this?

Mark Mills:

You know, when it comes to black swans, there's a reason we call them black swans. But even though black swans are common, by the way—it's an interesting phrase, common in the southern hemisphere, but that's a detail—black swans are uncommon here, where we write about them. So black swans fall into two categories almost always throughout history, and they do have a pattern. The pattern is because of people—politics and people. And by that, I mean the two classes of black swans that are impossible to predict except that they always happen at times we can't expect. One is war, which is very worrisome. Wars are black swans—I mean, but I don't mean isolated wars, big wars. And we pray and hope that there isn't going to be another one of those, because that changes everything, obviously. But the more common one is recessions. And recessions are triggered by political malfeasance and policy malfeasance and stupidity and greed of politicians and policymakers and players in the ecosystem that sort of, because there's regulations—unavoidable—politics are in regulation, in markets where you have kleptocrats that are bad actors, that's a toxic brew that episodically erupts into black swan events. And could we have a market crash because of a combination of things that will be obvious in hindsight, but not in advance? Sure. And would a market crash take the steam out of the capital available for propelling the AI boom? Yeah, of course. Of course it will delay it—it won't end it. The Great Depression did not end the great efflorescence of technology of the 20th century. If you measure the 20th century's wealth expansion—unprecedented in history—yet we had the biggest depression in modern history, and we had two horrific global wars. But the great wealth expansion still happened, but it got interrupted by human malfeasance and stupidity. So—yeah. Can we do it again? Sure, count on it. I'm just hoping and praying we at least get a run as long as the 1920s and the crash of '29 is our 2039.

Jim Puplava:

Well, I mean, my own state is a good example. We just—I think this year, at the end of the year, we're losing two more refiners. Chevron just moved out to Texas, and we have the highest gas and the highest utility rates in the country. And it's all, as you mentioned, it's all policy. We shut down our gas plants, we shut down one of our nuclear power plants, and we've got wind and solar, which are intermittent.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, no, these are all bad policies. They're harvesting the consequences of it. And if it keeps going, of course it can be catastrophic. And the catastrophe doesn't have to be economic—it can be political. Because when people get angry, you don't know what kind of government they're going to elect. It won't necessarily be a right-thinking—but I mean a sensibly thinking, free-market, democratic-oriented leader. You can end up with very bad outcomes when people get angry. And I—that's what I worry about. I mean, you know, I will again promote my book. At the end of my introduction, I point out that my book is not about politics. I only have two political observations in the book, in the introduction and the epilogue. And in the introduction, I point out that I don't talk about the politics of technology in my book, but I do point out—and I quoted Charles Krauthammer, who was asked before he died why he spent his life as a political commentator, even though he was a PhD psychiatric scientist trained at Harvard. He planned to go into research—psychiatric research. Brilliant guy. He became a political commentator because—I quote him saying this; it's stuck in my mind ever since he said it, I didn't know the man personally—well, I met him a few times. ""If you don't get the politics right, nothing else matters."" Okay? Amen.

Jim Puplava:

Wow, so true. And my own state is a good example. You know, one other thing—there was a gal by the name of Meredith Whitney, and she wrote a book called ""The State of the States,"" and she was talking about where industry jobs growth was going to go—sort of like in the middle of the country, over red flyover land. And if you look at where some of these data centers are going, they're going to places where there's not regulation, good political climate—Florida, places like that. I almost can see this happening because we're losing—we've lost over 400 major corporations: Oracle, Tesla, Hewlett Packard.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it's already happened. This is, again, you don't have to predict the future, you can predict what's already happened. So, the epicenter of data centers was Virginia, and still a lot being built there. But now it's going to Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Dakota, Wyoming—but especially Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma. Epicenters of, we'll call it, sane policies and lots of energy.

Jim Puplava:

You know, you wrote about where these new centers are going, and it really struck me about North Dakota. I mean, it's freezing there, they've got snow. But you know, if it's the regulations and everything's favorable, why not?

Mark Mills:

Well, the energy is abundant, and it's a lot for North Dakota. I mean, the data centers being built in North Dakota will consume more electricity than the entire population of North Dakota by a lot. It's because there's only a million people in North Dakota. So, you only have to build a couple of data centers and you're beating the population. But Canada's building data centers too, because they need them and also because they have cheap energy there. But again, the epicenter is currently, and I think will stay, the United States. I think there's enough bipartisan enthusiasm—again, remind everyone, I'm not naive about the anxieties and the challenges. I recognize those. And the opposition to data centers—they're big, big, big ugly buildings; you shouldn't put them beside residential areas any more than you put any other factory next to a nice residential area, in my view. But you know, this is—there's a widespread recognition, a bipartisan recognition, that this is a non-trivial, economically important, and geopolitically and strategically important private market-driven, private market-invested boom. And so, you want to facilitate that, you want that to happen now—with all the number of caveats. But you want it to happen. There is a bipartisan sense of that in the United States now, despite so much division and so much else. That's true. It's spilled over into nuclear energy to help fuel the next phase of data centers. This is great. Let's take advantage of it. I think there's some political momentum to find one narrow area of bipartisan comity.

Jim Puplava:

One final question, if I may. There's talk about the AI race between the U.S. and China. As you look at both countries, how do you see that playing out? Do you see the U.S. as the winner?

Mark Mills:

We're winning now—just in sheer volume of data centers, we're winning, largely in terms of the underlying technology. So yeah, I think right now we're winning. If it matters who's winners and losers, how does it play out over the next decade? It will have a lot to do with politics. I think we're likely—I mean, my epilogue in my book says I think we win. It's the 21st century as America's, not China's. And I don't say that jingoistically; I'm just saying this structurally in terms of population and demographics and entrepreneurship and capital markets that are free. But in the short term, China's got very good engineers. I've been to a dozen cities in China—very, very good, terrific manufacturing of factories. They're working very, very hard to catch up because economic power is geopolitical power, and they're not unaware of that, nor are we.

Jim Puplava:

It's interesting. I read a book called ""Breakneck,"" and it was a Chinese individual who talked about the difference between China and the U.S. He said China is made up of engineers—I think Xi is a chemical engineer—whereas the U.S. is made up of lawyers.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, I know. Well, that's part of the problem. Yeah, it is. Well, I like a lot of lawyers—there are some lawyers in our family. There are some very good lawyers. My longtime business partner was a brilliant lawyer and also a PhD mechanical engineer—he had both brains. Yeah, you look—the United States, a large number of our problems are self-inflicted wounds based on regulations and policies. And I would say that we're in the process of fixing that. That's what I see politically and structurally. And the beauty of the subsidiarity of our states is that even though the federal government may not be fixing it really quickly, we see at least a dozen states—maybe two dozen—that are rapidly trying to fix the problems of building factories, building data centers, restoring job opportunities. So, this is what most governors are hyper-focused on—most. So, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will trickle up into changing the federal system too.

Jim Puplava:

Well, as we close, why don't you bring up your book once again—fabulous, prescient book. And this article, which is on your website, the Center for Energy Analytics—""The Rise of AI,"" which is must reading if you really want to understand how this all works and all the various implications of energy.

Mark Mills:

So, the book—the book's easy to find at Amazon, you know, the magic Google machine. It's ""The Cloud Revolution"" with my name. You know, it's still there; they still publish it, they still sell it. And, you know, because as I said, I only predicted what's already underway. The fact that it's a few years old just means that you can—you can test whether the theories I promoted are happening and whether the ideas of where this is going would be true. That report, which is relatively dense—it's, I think, 20-plus pages, so it's not super long, it's graph- and data-rich—looks at the architecture of what's happening on AI and energy. As you said, it's free at the National Center for Energy Analytics website, which is energyanalytics.org. But again, just look up ""Mark Mills data centers AI"" and Dr. Google will point you right to it. I did a lecture when we released the report—a 20-minute lecture on the report—which I think will be available to put on YouTube. When it's available, I'll send it to you.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we'll put up some links. Just out of curiosity, why did you start the Center for Energy Analytics? That's a good thing. That's quite in-depth.

Mark Mills:

I ask myself that too. Well, short story is, there wasn't an independent think tank focused on energy—a national energy think tank. Universities have some think tanks, but that's not the same. There are lots of think tanks that focus on the environment or policy that relates to regulations and the economy, and the absence of such a beast—you know, I had colleagues and friends who agreed with me there needed to be one, and I got volunteered, in the Army sense of the word, to launch it about a year and a half ago. So, we're a real think tank now, putting on a lot of stuff. I welcome everybody.

Jim Puplava:

It's one of my go-to sites on energy, so—well, listen, Mark, I want to thank you as always for coming on the program. You're one of our most requested guests, so I saw the article and I said I got to get you on the program.

Mark Mills:

Well, thank you for having me back into the circle of trust, because your network is powerful and I hear from people after I do a podcast with you—I hear more often from—just say, this is not me blowing smoke up your skirt, as they say—but I hear more often from people when I'm on your podcast than when I do pretty much anything else. So, you're up in the top quintile, which is wonderful, and thank you.

Jim Puplava:

Well, listen, have a great Thanksgiving and a great rest of the year, and I hope to talk to you again next year.

Mark Mills:

Well, if you invite me back, I'll come back. Likewise. Have a great, great year-end. Take care, Jim.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), major producers are being pressed to begin planning for the phasing down of oil, gas, and coal in a just and orderly way.

For decades, climate negotiations have focused on emissions targets and clean-energy pledges while sidestepping the politically explosive question of whether – and how quickly – countries should phase out fossil-fuel production. COP28 broke new ground by introducing the phrase “transition away from fossil fuels,” but real progress has remained slow and uneven. At COP30, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has reset the tone, declaring that “the Earth can no longer sustain the intensive use of fossil fuels” and calling for a clear roadmap for phasing them out.

Resistance to a phaseout has historically come from major producer countries and energy companies. But many governments with legitimate social-justice concerns are also reluctant to support such a move, fearing it would impede efforts to reduce inequality and fund essential services.

Brazil, a rising energy power with vast renewable potential, but also deep poverty and a thriving offshore oil sector, is a prime example. When Lula argued that fossil-fuel dependence must end in a “planned and just” manner, he signaled that an orderly phaseout can support development rather than undermine it.

For Brazil, the challenge is to strengthen its global standing while navigating its own energy transition. Lula’s plan for a national fund that would direct some of Brazil’s oil revenues toward the green transition reflects this balance: the rents of the old economy would be used to build the new one without harming workers and vulnerable communities.

Such an approach is not without precedent. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, built on decades of oil revenues, invests heavily in low-carbon sectors worldwide and supports initiatives like the Amazon Fund. And in Southeast Asia, East Timor – heavily reliant on petroleum and gas – has pursued diversification strategies financed through its own resource revenues.

These examples show that channeling fossil-fuel income toward the green transition is both feasible and necessary. For too long, the idea has been treated as taboo by climate advocates, owing to fears that even discussing oil money might legitimize continued extraction.

Avoiding the issue, however, leaves resource-dependent countries without the means to finance their transitions before revenues dwindle. Until climate finance reaches the scale required, governments must support equitable, justice-oriented energy transitions by channeling fossil-fuel revenues through well-governed sovereign wealth funds.

Early efforts to repurpose resource income point to a broader shift. A decade ago, few governments could imagine a future without fossil fuels. But economic realities have changed: renewables are now cost-competitive, clean-fuel technologies have matured, and developing countries increasingly view the energy transition as a pathway to greater productivity, resilience, competitiveness, and sovereignty.

Brazil’s experience illustrates this trend. Like many resource-rich countries, it has long relied on oil rents to fund social programs and infrastructure; between 2011 and 2023, only a tiny fraction of federal royalties flowed to its main climate fund. It has since expanded its biofuels industry, started developing sustainable aviation fuels, and scaled up renewables, generating jobs in regions historically tied to extraction and showing that the energy transition can reinforce – not replace – a country’s development agenda.

Rising geopolitical tensions underscore the urgent need to diversify away from fossil fuels. With supply chains realigning, competition for global leadership in battery production, green hydrogen, sustainable infrastructure, and circular manufacturing is intensifying. At the same time, the International Energy Agency expects oil demand to plateau by 2035 even without stronger climate action, while OPEC sees demand growing through mid-century. Whatever the exact timeline, economies that are slow to diversify will be left with stranded assets once global consumption declines.

That risk is especially acute for Brazil, which has invested heavily in deep-water drilling. Just weeks before COP30, Brazil’s environmental agency granted Petrobras a license to drill at the mouth of the Amazon River – a highly sensitive ecological zone. Petrobras and some government officials argue that exploration is necessary for energy security, while environmental groups say the decision undermines Brazil’s climate leadership.

A clear, well-structured transition plan – rather than ad hoc, case-by-case decision-making – might have prevented these tensions. If Brazil wants its COP30 leadership to have a lasting impact, it must ensure that its new transition fund is more than symbolic. The government should clarify revenue allocations, establish transparent governance structures, and encourage civil-society participation. Integrating the fund into the country’s ecological transition plan would help channel resources toward job-creating sectors such as sustainable fuels, renewable energy, green industry, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

Internationally, Brazil must use its COP30 presidency to advance a cooperative approach to phasing out fossil fuels. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance – launched by Costa Rica and Denmark – has attempted to promote supply-side action, but major producers have stayed on the sidelines. Brazil could help bridge this divide by encouraging parties to develop guidelines for an orderly and flexible reduction in fossil-fuel production.

These discussions must produce a roadmap with clear criteria for determining realistic timelines that reflect national capabilities and historical responsibilities, as well as mechanisms that build on existing institutions rather than adding new layers of bureaucracy. Equally important, the fossil-fuel phaseout must be central to climate negotiations. This would signal that multilateralism still matters; that countries can collectively confront even the most politically sensitive issues; that fossil fuels are no longer treated as untouchable; and that producer states are willing to engage in a structured, cooperative process.

Ultimately, the green transition depends on confronting the issue of fossil-fuel revenues head-on. Otherwise, climate ambition cannot be reconciled with economic and political realities. Brazil has taken a bold step by raising this question at COP30 and framing transition as a socioeconomic opportunity, not just an ecological imperative. The challenge now is to turn the resulting discussion into a coherent plan – at home and globally.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/9b7233428034dc1bef9faf6f1d031a4e.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 12:01:14.910864

There were at least 10 in the running to land billion-dollar project that would bring hundreds of jobs. Two of them were out of the country. When the Iberia Parish site made the cut for the final three, things got interesting.

“We were really excited when we got to the top three,” said Mike Tarantino, ppresident and CEO of the Iberia Industrial Development Foundation. “That’s when we really had to put on our championship jackets and really work hard. We’re so happy First Solar chose us. We’re so excited to see this plant come to fruition.”

On Friday, First Solar’s leadership team along with local elected officials and other leaders celebrated the company’s inauguration at its New Iberia plant, opening its 2.4 million square foot building — now the largest facility under one roof in Louisiana — that represents its $1.1 billion investment in Iberia Parish.

It marked the end of a two-year process since it was announced in August 2023. Now the company will employ 826 and offer an average compensation package of $90,000.

“Today is a huge win for Iberia Parish,” said Millard Mulé, policy director for Gov. Jeff Landry. “It’s a huge win for our state’s workers, and it’s a huge win for Louisiana’s economy. First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.”

It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the U.S. When it announced plans to locate it Iberia Parish, the news was that it would be its fifth facility in the country and have a payroll of at least $40 million.

The plant opened in July, months ahead of schedule. Last week it announced plans to open a similar plant in South Carolina, its ninth overall.

The company will produce its Series 7 modules using American materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio along with steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing for First Solar outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.

“A level playing field — that’s all we need,” he said. “American workers can out-innovate and out-compete if given the opportunity. We're incredibly proud to inaugurate this facility as a symbol of American energy dominance and re-industrialization.”

The plant will also utilize artificial intelligence by using computer vision and deep learning to quickly detect defects in its products during production, officials said. Its technicians and operators can use AI tools to make operating adjustments and guide their decision making.

It will also add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s manufacturing footprint to 14 gigawatts by 2026 and 17.7 in 2027 when the South Carolina facility is expected to open.

First Solar, which has opened facilities in other similar-sized markets, expected to employ 5,500 people by the end of next year and have invested $4.5 billion in American manufacturing.

“We’ve been able to be successful to go into communities, in some cases, that other companies have left,” Widmar said. “Our factory that we put in Alabama, there was a paper mill there. Those guys went to China. We went back into that community, revived it and now it’s thriving. That’s what we want to do.”

First Solar was able to land in Iberia Parish thanks to a state incentives package that included LED workforce solutions program and performance-based grants for site development and infrastructure improvements totaling $30 million.

They want more to be done to transform the world's food system.

Protesters gathered outside a new space at the talks, the industry-sponsored “Agrizone,” to call for a transition toward a more grassroots food system, even as hundreds of lobbyists for big agriculture companies are attending the talks.

Though agriculture contributes about a third of Earth-warming emissions worldwide, most of the money dedicated to fighting climate change goes to causes other than agriculture, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

The FAO didn't offer any single answer as to how that spending should be shifted, or on what foods people should be eating.

“All the countries are coming together. I don’t think we can impose on them one specific worldview,” said Kaveh Zahedi, director of the organization's Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.

Research has generally shown that a plant-based diet can be better for health and the planet. But many people in poverty around the world who are hardest hit by climate change depend on animal sources of protein for survival. People in higher-income countries have more options for a healthy diet without meat. But those people still tend to contribute more to climate change with their dietary choices.

""We have to be very, very aware and conscious of those nuances, those differences that exist,” Zahedi said.

An alternative universe at COP for agriculture

When world leaders gather every year to try to address climate change, they spend much of their time in a giant, artificial world that typically gets built up just for the conference.

One corner of COP30, as this year's conference is known, featured the alternative universe of AgriZone, where visitors could step into a world of immersive videos and exhibits with live plants and food products. Those included a research farm that Brazilian national agricultural research corporation Embrapa built to showcase what they call low-carbon farming methods for raising cattle, and growing crops like corn and soy as well as ways to integrate cover crops like legumes or trees like teak and eucalyptus.

Ana Euler, executive director of innovation, business and technology transfer at Embrapa, said her industry can offer solutions needed especially in the Global South where climate change is hitting hardest.

""We need to be part of the discussions in terms of climate funds,"" Euler said. ""We researchers, we speak loud, but nobody listens.”

AgriZone was averaging about 2,000 visitors a day during COP30's two-week run, said Gabriel Faria, an Embrapa spokesman. That included tours for Queen Mary of Denmark, COP President André Corrêa do Lago and other Brazilian state and local officials.

But while the AgriZone seeks to spread a message of lower-carbon agriculture possibilities, industrial agriculture retains a big influence at the climate talks. The climate-focused news site DeSmog reported that more than 300 industrial agriculture lobbyists are attending COP30.

In the face of big industry, some call for a voice for smallholder farmers

On a humid evening at COP30's opening, a group of activists gathered on the grassy center of a busy roundabout in front of the AgriZone to call for food systems that prioritize good working conditions and sustainability and for industry lobbyists to not be allowed at the talks.

Those with the most sway are ""not the smallholder food producers, … not the peasants, and … definitely not all these people in the Global South that are experiencing the brunt of the crisis,"" said Pang Delgra, an activist with the Asian People’s Movement on Debt and Development who was among the protesters. “It’s this industrial agriculture and corporate lobbyists that are shifting the narrative inside COPs.”

As Indigenous people pushed to be heard at a COP that was supposed to be about them, some also called for countries to honor their knowledge of land stewardship.

“We have to decolonize our thoughts. It’s not just about changing to a different food,” said Sara Omi, from the Embera people of Panama and president of the Coordination of Territorial Leaders of the Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests.

“The agro-industrial systems are not the solution,"" she added.

In environments where chemical exposure can pose an invisible threat—from aircraft hangars to hospital rooms—XploSafe is equipping workers and responders with a new kind of protection. Based in Oklahoma, XploSafe has developed the XCel+ line of personal and environmental samplers, a technology that makes near real-time, broad-spectrum detection and quantification of airborne toxic chemicals accessible, portable, and precise.

Traditional chemical monitoring methods are often expensive, stationary, and limited to detecting known compounds. XploSafe’s XCel+ system overcomes these challenges through patented nanoconfinement technology that passively or actively captures a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs)—including aldehydes, ketones, organophosphates, and amines—without the need to pre-select targets. Adaptable to numerous EPA methods (such as TO-11A, TO-14A, TO-15, and TO-17), the system is designed for use in dynamic and demanding environments, from submarines and disaster zones to industrial sites and mobile medical units.

Supported by SBIR funding from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), XploSafe brought this innovation from early-stage R&D through rigorous field testing to global deployment. This support enabled the development of the integrated Data Repository Platform (DRP), a cloud-based system that manages digital chain-of-custody records and delivers occupational chemical exposure analytics, threshold alerts, and long-term exposure tracking—all from a mobile-first interface. Together, XCel+ and the DRP provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring, compliance, and rapid response to airborne chemical threats.

Since commercialization, the technology has generated over $3.5 million in revenue and gained traction across multiple sectors. The samplers are sold by XploSafe’s spin-off Airotect and distributed internationally by Assay Technology, a leader in chemical exposure monitoring. Users include the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, industrial hygienists, and emergency response teams operating in both routine and extreme conditions—including subarctic deployments and confined military installations.

The impact of XploSafe’s SBIR-supported work is both economic and societal. Commercial success has fueled job creation in Oklahoma and supported careers in chemistry, engineering, software, and manufacturing. At the same time, the technology is strengthening workplace safety, disaster preparedness, and public health research.

For XploSafe, the SBIR program was not only a funding mechanism—it was a launchpad. Federal investment allowed the company to develop a fully integrated, field-proven solution that is now actively protecting lives and shaping the future of chemical safety worldwide.",https://www.sbir.gov/sites/all/themes/sbir/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:34.658683

Europe is on track to surpass the US in total climate-tech capital deployed, while India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are scaling projects faster than many developed markets.

Europe’s Policy Engine and India’s Clean-Energy Breakthrough Lead the Shift

Sightline’s findings highlight Europe’s accelerating industrial transition. The region now accounts for 55% of global low-carbon cement capacity in development and 70% of projects under construction, driven by the EU carbon price and the forthcoming CBAM border-adjustment mechanism. Coordinated CO2 transport and storage networks are also creating the backbone for deep industrial decarbonization.

India emerges as the standout performer in emerging economies, ranking third worldwide in ammonia capacity (25 Mt/yr) and second in advanced nuclear (17 GW).wing deployment in wealthier nations.

Across the Global South, megaprojects are defining the next chapter of clean-energy industrialization.

Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion NEOM project is reshaping regional energy systems; Chile, Oman, Kazakhstan, and Mauritania are racing to supply Europe with low-carbon ammonia; and Singapore and Latin America are converting waste streams, biomass, and interconnection programs into competitive supply chains.

Sightline argues that deployment success increasingly hinges on governance rather than technology. Regions with coordinated planning, whether Central America’s interconnection programs or Europe’s CO2 hubs, are capturing investment and accelerating commercialization.

Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.","J.D. Power released on Thursday a new report estimating that US electric vehicle sales will drop 37.6% year over year in November, continuing the decline triggered by the EV tax credit deadline.

According to the data analysis firm, battery electric vehicles (BEV) are expected to represent 6% of all vehicle sales in November.

While the figures are consistent with October’s estimates, they are well below the 12.9% recorded in September, the firm noted.

Thomas King, J.D. Power’s President of OEM Solutions, commented on the results, saying that the anticipation of the EV credit deadline prompted consumers to “accelerate buying decisions,” which has caused sales to decline since October.

“Now, two months after the credit expired, the industry continues to feel the effect of those accelerated purchases,” he wrote.

Pricing Strategy

According to Tyson Jominy, Senior VP of OEM Customer Success, pricing trends further highlight the evolving EV landscape, as average prices on electric vehicles have risen 14% from November 2024.

EV prices have surged by $6,500 year over year to $52,400, making them the second most expensive powertrain after PHEVs.

ICE vehicles average $46,000 — about $8,000 lower — while traditional hybrids remain the most affordable option at $42,200.

“As the market adjusts to life without federal tax credits, manufacturers will need to rethink go-to-market strategies to balance affordability, profitability, and consumer demand in this new paradigm,” Jominy wrote.

EV Discounts

US automakers are still adjusting after several policy changes, including the expiration of the EV tax credit and the impact of tariffs on the overall market.

Along with these, Thomas King further noted that “evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year” also contribute to “some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns.”

J.D. Power expects discounts on EVs to average $11,689 in November, up $260 from November 2024 but down $928 from October 2025.

These figures highly contrast with estimates for non-EVs, which are projected at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

Several automakers have introduced new discounts and benefits to try to lower the impact of the consumer credit expiry.

These include offering the $7,500 discount — the same value as the credit — on the final pricing of the vehicle, as EV maker Lucid Motors has done.

General Motors and Ford also announced that they would “keep” offering the value to consumers buying electric vehicles, but then stepped back and began offering other discounts, such as Ford‘s 0% financing rate for contracts of up to 72 months.

Leasing

The scenario is also changing for leasing contracts, which EV makers like Rivian have depended on, since the price cap for the tax credit was higher for leases than for purchases.

To qualify for the tax credit when purchasing an electric vehicle, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) could not exceed $88,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles, such as sedans.

In November, leasing has declined 12% from a year ago, trending at 54%.

“Leasing remains a critical lever for EV adoption,” Tyson Jominy said, adding that it far outpaces leasing on ICE vehicles — at 20% — and hybrids — at 15%.

“While EV incentive spending has moderated compared to a year ago, the reliance on leasing and discounts underscores the challenges automakers face.”

Other Powertrains

J.D. Power expects a 5.2% decrease in overall vehicle sales this month in the US, with the total figures reaching below 1.26 million units.

Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.

Regular hybrids (HEV), however, are projected to rise by 3.6 percentage points, reaching a 14.5% market share.

Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are likely to grow as well, making up 77.5% of sales — an increase of 2.3 percentage points.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rivian_Charging_03.webp,N,,2025-11-21 23:58:40.615119

The SPEED Act restores common sense.","Lawmakers’ renewed focus on affordability is slowly coming into focus. It’s no secret that everything is more expensive, and energy is no exception. This month’s elections underscored the importance, and need, to reign in rising costs. When it comes to energy, a great way to create new jobs, make energy cheaper to produce and distribute, as well as unleash economic growth, is to reform and streamline the federal permitting process so that energy projects, ranging from power plants to transmission lines, come online and meet demand. Fortunately, the SPEED Act is progressing through the House of Representatives.

The SPEED Act primarily reforms the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process, a key procedural hurdle that often results in elongated delays for vital energy projects. This bill ensures NEPA reviews have consistent and predictable timelines, clarifies what is deemed a major Federal action to trigger a NEPA review, places reasonable judicial limitations on reviews, and simplifies the entire bureaucratic process.

The House Committee on Natural Resources passed the SPEED Act yesterday, a promising sign for the bill’s future. Several lawmakers highlighted the need to reform the permitting process and pass the SPEED Act during the committee markup:

Rep. Bruce Westerman (Arkansas): “The United States is unnervingly reliant on China for minerals critical to both high-tech military equipment and everyday civilian goods. Yet today, thanks in part to NEPA, it takes 29 years to get an American mine up and running. As committee members know, we have viable, domestic deposits of the critical minerals that we need. Permitting delays cannot be the reason why we fall behind our chief global rivals.”

Rep. Jeff Hurd (Colorado): “The federal NEPA environmental review process was never intended to be a climate policy, it was never intended to be a litigation strategy for stopping reasonable projects that promote economic growth. It was meant to ensure agencies look before they act, instead it has become a system that stalls projects and gives an advantage to foreign competitors, especially China. The SPEED Act restores common sense. It focuses reviews on real impacts, not speculative ones…. This is not about weakening environmental protections, it’s about ending unreasonable delays so that states can actually build what they need.”

Rep. Harriet Hageman: (Wyoming): “The SPEED Act is designed to ensure that we can build the infrastructure and develop the energy we need to power this country. It is project agnostic and one of the rare examples where Washington, D.C. is not selecting winners and losers, but rather making structural updates that bring benefits across every important sector that Americans rely on.

Americans for Prosperity is a strong supporter of this legislation and thanks the lawmakers driving this bill forward.

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration's trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar's Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

""First Solar's investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,"" said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. ""This is exactly how we advance President Trump's agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we're strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.""

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

""This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It's a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we're demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn't just a thesis, it's an operating reality.""

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

""This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,"" said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. ""Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.""

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country's leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world's largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

""This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It's a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we're demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn't just a thesis, it's an operating reality.""

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

""This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,"" said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. ""Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.""

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country's leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world's largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Is Revolution Wind safe from federal opposition?","A federal judge is weighing whether the Trump administration’s sweeping pause on offshore wind projects was lawful, raising renewed legal uncertainty around major clean-energy initiatives — including Revolution Wind, a significant offshore wind farm under construction off the Rhode Island coast that will power hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

In presiding over a lawsuit filed by a coalition of states, U.S. District Judge Patti Saris on Nov. 18 questioned whether agencies “could lawfully implement” a blanket ban simply because “the president told me to do it.”

Back on track after September ruling

The new court showdown comes a few months after another federal ruling allowed Revolution Wind to resume construction. In September, Judge Royce Lamberth granted a preliminary injunction that reversed a stop-work order and permitted the project to restart.

Charles Rothenberger, climate and energy attorney with Save the Sound, praised the earlier ruling and insisted the project is still on track.

“There are people on the water and on the docks working to finish the last dozen of those turbines before the project can be fully energized in the second quarter of 2026,” he said.

He acknowledged that winter could slow progress but noted delays are already built into the timeline.

“Because of the delay … with the onset of winter weather, some of that work will naturally slow down,” he said.

Benefits to consumers

Rothenberger argued that once completed, Revolution Wind — slated to deliver power to Connecticut and Rhode Island — will offer major advantages.

“Access to clean, renewable energy for about 350,000 homes … more than 1,000 jobs,” he said. “Offshore wind is really the solution to multiple problems we face here in New England.”

He highlighted its ability to address winter reliability issues in the electricity grid: “The generation profile is really ideally suited to address the winter reliability concerns … because of our reliance on natural gas.” He also pointed to analyses showing the project’s potential to lower wholesale energy prices and protect customers from volatile natural gas costs.

Is Revolution Wind safe from federal opposition?

When pressed on the risk of further political or legal interference, Rothenberger expressed cautious optimism.

“I wouldn’t want to jinx anything,” he said, “But … it’s clear … the only thing to be done is to finish assembling it and get it energized.”

He added that the project already holds all federal and state permits solidly in hand, suggesting the worst of the regulatory fights may be behind them.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb68d9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fab%2F88c70174433780b5dbe8dff7b07c%2F250825-newlondonwind-tra5037xx.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:27.036101

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

OREGON GOVERNOR DIRECTS STATE TO SPEED UP CLEAN ENERGY: Governor Tina Kotek issued an executive order that will speed up the process of building and connecting new clean energy generation to the electrical grid. This will help Oregon meet rising energy demand while lowering costs for consumers and reducing harmful climate pollution.

OLCV TAKE: Oregon League of Conservation Voters Executive Director Lindsey Scholten said, “The State Energy Strategy made it clear that electrification is essential to keeping our communities safe and resilient. The Governor’s Executive Order is a good first step in implementing these recommendations, putting our state on a path to reach our climate goals and ensure clean, affordable energy for Oregonians.”

PENNSYLVANIA COUNTY TO MAKE POLLUTERS PAY: The Allegheny County Council unanimously voted to increase permit fees for polluters. Revenue from these permits will support pollution monitoring and enforcement of clean air laws to improve public health.

CHISPA NV CALLS ON STATE LAWMAKERS TO RESTORE FAIR ENERGY RATES: After the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada voted to keep NV Energy’s controversial daily demand charge despite strong opposition from families and advocates, Chispa Nevada and partner organizations called on state lawmakers to intervene and restore fair, predictable rates for Nevadans.

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada Program Director Audrey Peral said, “We’re incredibly disappointed with the PUCN’s decision. We feel that someone needs to act and really protect us all, because utility monopolies are continuing to make millions of dollars while communities are struggling to survive.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTES ON DIRTY ENERGY AND ANTI-DEMOCRACY BILLS: This week, House Republicans advanced a slew of bills aimed at promoting dirty energy, weakening our democracy, and worsening the affordability crisis.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “After seven weeks of doing nothing to deliver affordability for families, House Republicans are prioritizing votes this week that give handouts to polluters instead of addressing skyrocketing costs across the country and continued threats to our democracy. From selling off our public lands to oil, gas, and coal executives to approving projects without evaluating impacts and limiting public input, these bills are corrupt polluter handouts that will likely raise energy costs across the country.

“At the same time, Congressional Republicans are trying to take away people’s voice and participation in our democracy. Taking away the Department of Energy’s required public interest determination before allowing more liquid methane gas (LNG) exports, illegitimately cancelling protections for public lands that were set up through a public process with public input, and overruling DC laws that were passed by our elected representatives, only tramples on our democratic processes and self-government. Instead of advancing giveaways for polluters, Congress should be taking action to ensure polluters pay their fair share of rising costs from climate change and harming our health, the Trump administration stops its ban on affordable clean energy, and our democratic processes and institutions remain strong.”

PRO-POLLUTER ‘SPEED ACT’ ADVANCES IN COMMITTEE: The House Natural Resources Committee marked up the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, moving to prop up Big Polluters at the expense of environmental protections and public input. Read more about LCV’s opposition to the SPEED Act, the PERMIT Act, and more about the benefits of NEPA.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “House Republicans have once again shown they are more interested in helping their fossil fuel billionaire buddies instead of working to lower utility costs for American families. The SPEED Act is another giveaway to Big Polluters that allows the Trump administration to continue its assault on clean energy while rigging the permitting process for harmful projects by cutting public input, gutting environmental protections, and blocking people’s day in court. Adequate staffing and resources delivered improvements in permitting timelines last year, and yet this bill does nothing to stop the indiscriminate firings of career civil servants or disregard for congressional direction on funding. We urge Congress to follow the lead of the members of Congress who opposed this bill in committee today and get serious about lowering utility costs by building clean, affordable energy that creates jobs and protects the health of our communities.”

SENATE VOTES TO SUPPORT METHANE POLLUTION LIMITS DELAY: The Senate voted down a Congressional Review Act resolution led by Senators Adam Schiff (CA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) that would have invalidated the EPA’s harmful and unlawful rule to delay compliance deadlines for the oil and gas industry to cut dangerous methane pollution.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote said, “This vote once again shows that the allegiance of Senate Republicans lies with big polluters and their profits, not the health of our families and communities. By greenlighting EPA’s unlawful delay of compliance deadlines for the oil and gas industry to cut dangerous methane pollution, these Senators have signed off on pumping more cancer-causing pollution into frontline communities, worsening our climate, and wasting money and our natural resources. We thank Senators Schiff and Whitehouse for leading the effort to reverse the EPA’s harmful action and standing up for our communities, and we will continue to fight alongside them for strong methane standards that protect public health and the environment.”

TRUMP ADMIN RELEASES RECKLESS 5-YEAR LEASE SALE PLAN FOR OFFSHORE DRILLING: The Trump administration released its reckless and dangerous draft five year plan opening 1.3 billion acres of waters for offshore oil and gas drilling. The plan would auction waters off the coast of Alaska and southern and central California and in the Gulf of Mexico for drilling.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “As extreme weather becomes more frequent and severe, the Trump administration is moving full steam ahead on its dangerous agenda to make our communities less safe by releasing a plan to allow offshore oil and gas leasing in several previously protected areas. This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs. As families face skyrocketing energy bills and extreme weather becomes more dangerous, we should be investing in affordable, fast, and reliable clean energy–not opening up our coasts to costly, dangerous drilling that threatens our health, safety, and future.”

TRUMP ADMIN RELEASES POLLUTED WATER RULE: EPA and the Department of the Army released a revised Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule restricting which bodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. This rule, better characterized as the “Polluted Water Rule,” would be devastating for our waters and communities, and is another attempt to dismantle the bedrock Clean Water Act.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote said, “The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies. In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon.

“The public overwhelmingly supports stronger protections for our waters, and contrary to this administration’s preference, do not think polluting industries should be left to police themselves. The Trump administration should abandon this attempt to ignore science and the law, and work to ensure everyone, no matter who they are or where they live, has access to the clean water they deserve.”

TRUMP ADMIN FORCES MICHIGAN COAL PLANT TO STAY OPEN: The Department of Energy issued a third order to force the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in Ottawa County, Michigan to stay open. The plant was set to close in May, but has been forced to restart by the Trump administration, adding over $80 million in costs that will be passed on to ratepayers. Michigan state lawmakers have introduced a resolution calling for an end to the Trump administration’s reckless order.

MLCV TAKE: Michigan League of Conservation Voters Federal Government Affairs Director Bentley Johnson said, “The decision to keep Campbell open comes at a time when costs for everything are up and Michigan families are having to make hard decisions of whether to pay their light bill or put food on the table. Despite promising to bring energy costs down, Trump’s policies are causing them to skyrocket and the impact is being felt right here in Michigan.”

Level playing field It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.","When Georges Antoun came to Louisiana from Lebanon in the early 1980s, he needed money.

The country was entering an oil crisis, and cities along the Gulf Coast — especially places like Lafayette that depended on oil and gas jobs — felt the hit first.

As families moved to larger cities like Houston in search of work, Antoun began offering a service: For a fee, he’d drive their moving trucks back to Louisiana.

It's no secret that Louisiana has long lost talent to its western neighbor and has sought ways to entice them back.

The opening of First Solar's $1.1 billion solar panel manufacturing facility near New Iberia has allowed Antoun, now the company's chief commercial officer, to have conversations with families who have chosen to return to Louisiana to work at the facility.

The 2.4 million-square-foot mega complex is one of the largest investments in the Acadiana region and is expected to provide more than 800 jobs by the end of 2025.

Two years in the making

When the site selection process began for First Solar to find its next manufacturing facility, leaders in Iberia Parish and Acadiana got to work.

There were at least 10 sites in the running to land billion-dollar project that would bring hundreds of jobs. Two of them were out of the country. When the Iberia Parish site made the cut for the final three, things got interesting.

“That’s when we really had to put on our championship jackets and really work hard,"" said Mike Tarantino, ppresident and CEO of the Iberia Industrial Development Foundation. ""We’re so happy First Solar chose us. We’re so excited to see this plant come to fruition.”

On Friday, First Solar’s leadership team along with local elected officials and other leaders celebrated the company’s inauguration at its New Iberia plant, opening its 2.4 million square foot building — now the largest facility under one roof in Louisiana — that represents its $1.1 billion investment in south Louisiana.

It marked the end of a two-year process since it was announced in August 2023. Now the company will employ 826 and offer an average compensation package of $90,000.

The opening is a huge win for the region and the state, said Millard Mulé, policy director for Gov. Jeff Landry. “It’s a huge win for our state’s workers, and it’s a huge win for Louisiana’s economy. First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.”

It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the United States. When it announced plans to locate in Iberia Parish, the news was that it would be its fifth facility in the country and have a payroll of at least $40 million.

The plant opened in July, months ahead of schedule. Last week it announced plans to open a similar plant in South Carolina, its ninth overall.

The company will produce its Series 7 modules using American materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio along with steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

Economic dividends

The Louisiana investment is already paying dividends, with Acadiana manufacturers like Noble Plastics announcing in September that it would undergo an $8.5 million expansion to supply the New Iberia location. Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.

""You feel the impact immediately, ""Antoun said. ""I'm very proud, given that I'm a Louisiana boy. ""

The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added. The state, known for its damaging hurricanes and flooding, at first made the board uneasy, but it had one thing going for it — a highly skilled, easily transferable workforce.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette and South Louisiana Community College were also eager to help win over the company, providing a curriculum and simulated training for new hires, and tapping the university for a large portion of its workforce.

""Pushback is normal,"" he said. ""Louisiana is a tough place to build. South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there. Flooding, tax-wise, insurance-wise. This took a bit of doing and bringing it here. But the company was committed to drive it in here.""

""(UL-Lafayette) produces a tremendous amount of engineers and technical degrees, and a lot of folks don't want to leave the area. They want to stay here.""

Level playing field

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.

“A level playing field — that’s all we need,” he said. “American workers can out-innovate and out-compete if given the opportunity. We're incredibly proud to inaugurate this facility as a symbol of American energy dominance and re-industrialization.”

The plant will also utilize artificial intelligence by using computer vision and deep learning to quickly detect defects in its products during production, officials said. Its technicians and operators can use AI tools to make operating adjustments and guide their decision making.

First Solar, which has opened facilities in other similar-sized markets, expected to employ 5,500 people by the end of next year and have invested $4.5 billion in American manufacturing.

“We’ve been able to be successful to go into communities, in some cases, that other companies have left,” Widmar said. “Our factory that we put in Alabama, there was a paper mill there. Those guys went to China. We went back into that community, revived it and now it’s thriving. That’s what we want to do.”

The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.

""You're going to see us throttle down, throttle up. We're trying to react to the market,"" Antoun said. ""We've been on a tremendous growth over the past 10 years. Now we're at a point where we need to understand what our friends in Washington will do and what certainties they will put.""

The company will also provide high-paying jobs averaging $80,000 to $90,000, totaling $75 million in annual labor income, according to data collected by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at UL.

Antoun also believes the company will likely continue its rapid growth as the largest solar panel manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere. Just seven years ago, the company could produce around 2.5 gigawatts of solar panels a year, compared to the 17.7 GW it expects to create once the South Carolina facility is operational.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for renewable energy well known over the years, going as far as sunsetting Biden-era solar tax credits earlier than they were set to expire. The decision killed dozens of early-stage utility-scale solar projects planned for Louisiana.

But Trump's marquee One Big Beautiful Bill has produced ""tailwinds"" for the 100% American-made company, Proenca said, adding that First Solar is one of the only solar companies listed on the White House's investment list, which shows domestic corporate investment.

""Can we survive without incentives? The answer is yes,"" Antoun said.

In an energy-hungry America, Antoun said, solar remains the cheapest and most quickly deployable form of energy.

""Everybody is looking for power as a country, as the U.S.,"" he said. ""We have no spare power. Is it solar? Is it natural gas? Is it coal? Is it nuke? Look, it's all of the above.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1b/11b94004-c940-59ab-a7d6-58bfcd64dd42/6920e0f72bd8d.image.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:39.286260

The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources.
“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs.
Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.

The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources. The measures mark another significant step toward cleaner air for all Coloradans.

“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs. “With these strategic actions, the state reaffirms its commitment to protecting the health of our residents and the environment for future generations to come.”

Ground-level ozone pollution is a harmful air pollutant that can affect lung health, particularly for children, seniors, and those with respiratory conditions. It forms at ground-level when pollutants known as “ozone precursors” react in heat and sunlight. Emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are ozone precursors. Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.

In March 2023, the Governor directed state agencies to develop new rules to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from upstream oil and gas operations by 30% in 2025 and 50% by 2030 in the parts of Colorado that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution, which are known as ozone nonattainment areas. Following this request, the commission approved new updates to several Colorado Air Quality Control Commission Regulations, targeting sectors emitting high levels of ozone pollution precursors. These include:

Regulation 7: Extending the nitrogen oxide intensity program, expanding leak detection and repair program requirements for oil and gas operations, including storage and transferring processes.

Regulation 11: Identifying more vehicles that emit high levels of ozone precursors.

Regulation 25: Limiting volatile organic compounds for coating materials in aerospace.

Regulation 26: Strengthening emissions controls for combustion equipment and industrial waste in northern Weld County.

The commission included many of the regulatory updates in changes to Colorado's State Implementation Plan. The plan outlines actions that Colorado is taking to reduce air pollution in the ozone nonattainment areas. Additionally, the updated plan allows for further technical analysis to support future policies reducing ground-level ozone.

The commission also revised administrative protocols and regulatory language. These changes will make ozone pollution-reducing programs, such as the federally required vehicle emissions testing program, sustainable over the long term, correct outdated language to align with current state and federal requirements, and revise modeling and emissions credit rules to make compliance easier.

The commission approved a strategic proposal to proactively reclassify portions of the state as nonattainment for the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone. The reclassification would impact a smaller section of northern Weld County. If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approves the voluntary reclassification request, this would enable the state to focus additional resources on reducing emissions without the burden of administrative tasks.

Colorado is committed to continuing its work on reducing emissions within its control. Learn more about the actions the state is taking to work towards meeting federal ozone pollution standards.

The closure comes after other communications revealed the company could not meet payroll.

The EV maker's parent company, Bollinger Innovations, delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index in October.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, is closing after a long slog of poor performance, never quite getting off the ground.

According to emails reviewed by the Detroit Free Press, sent by Bollinger's Human Resources Director, Helen Watson, the embattled EV maker's last day of business was Friday, Nov. 21.

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" the email from Watson said.

On Wednesday, Nov. 19, the Free Press reported that Bollinger was struggling to meet payroll. The EV maker currently has 59 claims of unpaid wages pending with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, a department spokesperson confirmed.

Days later, the company is shuttering operations.

Watson told employees in the email that David Michery, the CEO of Bollinger Innovations (Bollinger Motors' parent company), will ""make us whole with regards to the remaining monies"" that went unpaid as the company missed payroll for the last two pay periods.

""I am working on creating checks for the 10/31/2025 payroll and believe they will be in hand on Monday,"" Watson wrote. ""It is the end of an era but one you should all be very proud of.""

Bollinger Motors' website, as of late Nov. 21, still reflects the brand's commitment to building ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet.""

Bollinger Motors was founded in 2015 and built vehicles in Livonia, through Roush Industries, and is headquartered in Oak Park.

The company's site lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued over a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company exited the receivership in June.

At least six suppliers have taken legal action against Bollinger this year to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Michery, the CEO of Bollinger's parent company, took over as the leader of Bollinger Motors in June. Michery rebranded his own California-based EV start-up, Mullen Automotive, to the Bollinger name, pulling all brands under the ""Bollinger Innovations"" umbrella.

Now Bollinger Motors, the maker of the chassis trucks and SUV prototypes, is closed for good. Bollinger Innovations has not closed.

On Sept. 23, Bollinger Innovations announced via an online news release that it would no longer perform reverse stock splits, a tactic used to amalgamate several cheaper shares of a stock into one more valuable share of a stock, as a method of staying on the Nasdaq Composite stock market index. Bollinger Innovations had undergone at least six reverse stock splits during the last 12 months, according to company announcements.

The company delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index on Oct. 13 after dropping below the threshold of $1 per share.

The Free Press left messages on social media requesting comment from Michery. A phone number attached to Bollinger Innovations news releases delivered an automated message when called, indicating the phone line was not in operation.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/PDTF/87352974007-bollinger-screenshot-20251119-111400.png?crop=1104,621,x0,y0&width=1104&height=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 19:59:19.161198

New guidance from EPA promises more flexibility to begin certain project activities before receiving a New Source Review (NSR) permit for new industrial facilities and/or expansion of existing facilities.
These NSR permits are enforceable legal documents that typically determine what construction is allowed, what air emissions must be met, and how the source can be operated consistently with air quality requirements.
Environmental groups have sent letters to EPA arguing that this issue requires formal rulemaking rather than case-by-case guidance.
It is critical to stay up to date with the latest EPA guidance, review permit provisions, and attend to comprehensive recordkeeping.","Recent changes in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) permitting policies under the Clean Air Act are making waves across the construction industry and in environmental law. New guidance from EPA promises more flexibility to begin certain project activities before receiving a New Source Review (NSR) permit for new industrial facilities and/or expansion of existing facilities. These NSR permits are enforceable legal documents that typically determine what construction is allowed, what air emissions must be met, and how the source can be operated consistently with air quality requirements. These efforts are intended to remove barriers that stifle construction and, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated, “make America the AI capital of the world.”

The September 2 letter from EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Aaron Szabo, to Maricopa County Air Quality Department Director Philip McNeeley, confirms EPA’s intention to propose and finalize modification to the NSR regulations in 2026 to address modification of the definition of “begin actual construction.” In the meantime, Szabo suggests in the letter that EPA will advise on matters of interpretation of the term on a case-by-case basis:

“Consistent with the views expressed in the March 2020 Draft Guidance, the EPA continues to recognize that the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s regulation prohibits ‘the initiation of physical on-site construction on an emissions unit’ and that this does not prohibit initiation of physical on-site construction of those parts of a facility that do not qualify as an emission unit.”

EPA also signaled that its interpretation of “emission unit” will not be “overly broad.”

However, environmental groups argue EPA does not have the authority to allow substantial on-site work before preconstruction air permits for an entire facility are in place. Environmental groups have sent letters to EPA arguing that this issue requires formal rulemaking rather than case-by-case guidance. While this issue has not yet spurred litigation, it is possible environmental groups could file a petition for review or attempt to elicit persons with standing to enjoin projects from proceeding before preconstruction air permits have been issued.

Given the heightened scrutiny from environmental groups, construction projects should proceed cautiously. Projects must assist the regulatory agency in developing an administrative record that supports a regulatory conclusion that the proposed preconstruction activities are distinguishable from construction of the emission unit, capture device, etc. It is critical to stay up to date with the latest EPA guidance, review permit provisions, and attend to comprehensive recordkeeping. Doing so safeguards project timelines and budgets, preserves the reputations of project participants, and mitigates the risks of relying on administrative guidance before issuance of a NSR permit. Owners, developers, and contractors involved in construction projects should take care to participate in the rulemaking process on this issue when the opportunity arises to ensure EPA is made aware of the practical intricacies of preconstruction activities as they relate to the implementation of any administrative guidance or formal rulemaking.

If you are unsure of what activities you can legally conduct prior to the issuance of any preconstruction permits or if you need assistance navigating the permitting landscape, please reach out to the authors of this alert.",https://www.steptoe-johnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:48.770434

This week, House Republicans continued our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by passing legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets.

“New Yorkers know that Kathy Hochul’s failed bail reform has unleashed a crime wave across our state by emboldening violent criminals and putting law-abiding New Yorkers in harm’s way.
Kathy Hochul's failed bail reform has literally caused murders, assaults, rapes, and heinous crimes to be committed against law abiding New Yorkers.","Here’s a recap of what Republicans achieved on the House Floor this week:

Keeping Violent Criminals Off D.C.’s Streets ✅

Currently, the District of Columbia has a cashless bail policy that prohibits using cash bail as a condition for pre-trial release. This reckless policy allows soft-on-crime progressive judges to release dangerous criminals onto the streets of D.C. with only a promise to not re-offend and show up for their future court date, resulting in multiple arrests and putting public safety at risk.

We cannot allow dangerous criminals to roam the streets freely and threaten the safety of everyone in our nation’s capital while they await trial. It’s past time for D.C. to abandon its soft-on-crime policies and make sure those charged with committing violent crimes remain behind bars to ensure the safety of law-abidding Americans.

This week, House Republicans continued our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by passing legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets. Our bill amends the current D.C. Code to mandate the detention of individuals charged with violent and dangerous offenses and implement cash bail for crimes that threaten public safety, such as aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. This legislation codifies Executive Action taken by President Trump to clean up D.C. crime and make our nation’s capital safe again.

Rep. Elise Stefanik’s legislation, H.R. 5214, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, amends D.C.’s pre-trial release and detention processes to require mandatory pre-trial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes and for cash bail or bail bonds for defendants charged with certain crimes concerning public safety and order.

“New Yorkers know that Kathy Hochul’s failed bail reform has unleashed a crime wave across our state by emboldening violent criminals and putting law-abiding New Yorkers in harm’s way. Kathy Hochul's failed bail reform has literally caused murders, assaults, rapes, and heinous crimes to be committed against law abiding New Yorkers. As the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul continues to fuel her crime crisis and wage war on our corrections system by closing more prisons, she has made clear she will always side with criminals over law abiding New Yorkers,” said Rep. Stefanik. “Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought for the safety of New Yorkers and the support of our brave law enforcement. This week I proudly voted to end cashless bail in D.C which Congress has jurisdiction over.”

What Members Said:

Supporting Police Officers and Cleaning Up our Nation’s Capital ✅

While crime skyrocketed in D.C., Democrats went after the police working to protect the community instead of the criminals putting Americans at risk. The D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 allows police officers to be targeted by protestors, bans officers from watching body-camera footage when writing initial incident reports, demands a jury consider if an officer consulted with mental health, behavioral health, or social workers prior to use of deadly force, dismisses officers and police union representatives from the Police Complaints Board, and strips officers of collective bargaining rights regarding discipline.

Under the D.C. Council’s emergency legislative powers, these harmful policies have been in place since 2020; meanwhile, D.C. police staffing reached the half-century low as homicides rose to their highest number since 1997. Additionally, juvenile crime in the District has reached historic levels while truancy grows.

Congress has a duty to oversee the governance of D.C. and make sure the MPD is able to effectively fight crime and keep Washingtonians and visitors safe. President Trump has taken significant strides to clean up D.C. streets, and House Republicans are likewise committed to restoring law and order in the District. This week, we passed legislation to reverse dangerous anti-police measures in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 to deliver the support our law enforcement needs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde’s legislation, H.R. 5107, the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC (CLEAN DC) Act, repeals the D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 which placed harmful and burdensome requirements on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

“For years, the D.C. City Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2022 has prevented our men and women in blue from effectively protecting Americans in our nation’s capital, hindered the MPD’s ability to recruit and retain officers, and exacerbated Washington’s crime crisis,” said Rep. Clyde. “I’m incredibly pleased that my commonsense legislation to repeal this anti-police law passed with bipartisan support, and I look forward to a similar outcome in the Senate. By eliminating the D.C. Council’s misguided law, the CLEAN D.C. Act strengthens and codifies President Trump’s successful efforts to restore law and order in Washington. While Joe Biden foolishly vetoed my legislation in 2023, I look forward to advancing the CLEAN D.C. Act to President Trump’s desk for his signature to continue delivering on our shared goal of Making D.C. Safe Again.”

What Members Said:

Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism ✅

Socialism is one of the most destructive ideologies in world history, time and time again proving itself to be a failed experiment that only leads to communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships. More than 100 million people have been killed as a result of the mass murders and famines that accompany failed socialist states, including tens of millions of people during the Bolshevik Revolution, between 15 and 55 million people who died of starvation in the wake of famine caused by China’s Great Leap Forward, at least 3.5 million people who have starved in North Korea, and more.

Despite the proven dangers of socialism, America is seeing a troubling rise in the harmful ideology, especially with our youth – most recently culminating in the election of radical socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Since 2016, more Democrats have held positive views of socialism than of capitalism, with 66 percent of Democrats now viewing socialism favorably, while only 42 percent view capitalism favorably. Additionally, 62 percent of Americans between the ages 18 to 29 hold a favorable view of socialism, and 34 percent of communism.

Socialism and the abuses it leads to go against everything our Founding Fathers stood for. We cannot allow history to be ignored and the threat of socialism to grow unchallenged in America. House Republicans passed legislation that denounces the horrors of socialism and reaffirms our commitment to uphold the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness.

H. Con. Res. 58, introduced by Congresswoman Maria Salazar, describes the horrors perpetrated by socialist regimes, denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.

“Socialism is a lie. It has never delivered justice or equality, only fear, censorship, poverty, and broken nations. I represent thousands of families who fled their homelands because socialist regimes promised paradise and delivered prisons,” said Rep. Salazar. “Today, the House is sending a clear message: we will never allow socialism’s failed, destructive ideology to take root in the United States. America must remain the beacon of freedom that exposes socialism’s lies and defends the God-given rights of every individual.”",https://www.majorityleader.gov/images/majorityleader-meta.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 21:00:46.441842

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations.
Toyota West Virginia assembles more than one million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles annually and represents a $3.3 billion investment, the company said.

Toyota Missouri: $57.1 Million, 57 Jobs Toyota’s casting plant in Troy, Missouri, will add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles.","Toyota’s U.S. manufacturing presence is expanding again to meet growing demand for hybrid vehicles, company officials stated in a press release. As a part of Toyota’s recent commitment to invest up to $10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, the company announced a $912 million investment and 252 new jobs across five manufacturing plants to increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to its production lineup.

This investment in Toyota’s plants in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri further builds on the company’s ongoing commitment to reinvesting profits in its U.S. operations, noted the release.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Toyota’s State-by-State Investments

Toyota West Virginia: $453 Million, 80 Jobs

Toyota’s Buffalo, West Virginia, plant will add 80 jobs to increase assembly of 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. The expansion, which will begin production in 2027, also includes new shift patterns for greater efficiency. Toyota West Virginia assembles more than one million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles annually and represents a $3.3 billion investment, the company said.

Toyota Kentucky: $204.4 Million, 82 Jobs

Located in Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota’s largest plant globally will add 82 jobs and install an all-new machining line for 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines by 2027. Toyota says the powertrain facility can assemble up to 700,000 units annually. Toyota Kentucky employs nearly 10,000 team members and represents an investment exceeding $11 billion.

Toyota Mississippi: $125 Million

Toyota’s Blue Springs, Mississippi, plant will add the hybrid-electric Corolla, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the U.S. The plant employs 2,400 people and represents a $1.3 billion investment.

Toyota Tennessee: $71.4 Million, 33 Jobs

Toyota’s casting plant in Jackson, Tennessee, will add 33 jobs to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases and housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles. The investment includes three all-new production lines and will increase production capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually. Production on the new lines will start in 2027 and 2028. The plant represents a $497 million investment.

Toyota Missouri: $57.1 Million, 57 Jobs

Toyota’s casting plant in Troy, Missouri, will add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles. The new line, which will start production in 2027, will increase plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually and bring the total investment to $629 million.

Toyota’s Commitment to the US

Toyota says this investment supports its broader goal to invest up to $10 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing. Currently, Toyota assembles about half of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., with North American manufacturing facilities assembling more than three-quarters (76%) of the vehicles it sells in the U.S.

Toyota’s multi-pathway powertrain approach continues to drive steady growth in electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-ins and all-electric, which now account for nearly 50% of the company’s U.S. sales, officials stated.

“We’re proud of our plant’s continued growth and honored to help lead Toyota’s transition into a mobility company,” said Alivia Luikart, team member, Toyota West Virginia. “Our future is bright, and it’s rewarding to know that our company has faith in our ability and trusts our team to drive Toyota forward.”

Toyota’s Driving Possibilities Initiative

Beyond its manufacturing investments, Toyota says that it is also actively preparing the workforce of the future. The Toyota USA Foundation recently launched Driving Possibilities, a $110 million initiative to support pre-K through K-12 education and beyond. The long-term program aims to close educational gaps through innovative, hands-on STEM learning while addressing the essential needs of students and families.",https://theshopmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tech-looking-at-camera-in-Toyota-hyprid-production-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 21:59:19.026651

First, the editorial highlights Fanco’s plan to reprocess spent nuclear fuel on-site.
The closest analogue is a West Valley, New York, facility that reprocessed commercial spent fuel and operated for only six years.
Moreover, for the economics of reprocessing to pencil out, Indiana would likely need to import spent fuel from other states.","I share George Gemelas’ commitment to abundant, reliable electricity while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But his enthusiasm for a “closed-loop” small modular reactor (or SMR) complex requires a more careful look (“George Gemelas: Indiana just leveled up as leader in nuclear power,” Forefront, Nov. 14). Indiana is being invited to take on risks for an industry whose promises are unproven.

First, the editorial highlights Fanco’s plan to reprocess spent nuclear fuel on-site. This is unprecedented in the USA. The closest analogue is a West Valley, New York, facility that reprocessed commercial spent fuel and operated for only six years. The site has been in cleanup for nearly half a century and remains one of the most complex nuclear remediation projects in the country. Indiana officials should visit West Valley before assuming reprocessing is straightforward or low impact.

Second, Gemelas endorses a strategy of burning more natural gas while hoping new reactors arrive in the 2030s. Natural gas emits about a pound of CO2-equivalent for every 2 kWh generated, worsening the climate crisis now while gambling on technology that may or may not be ready later. If SMRs fall behind schedule or fail to perform, what is Indiana’s Plan B?

Third, even with reprocessing, long-lived high-level nuclear waste remains. The United States has no deep geological repository, and none will be available for decades. That means any high-level waste created here will stay in Indiana indefinitely. Moreover, for the economics of reprocessing to pencil out, Indiana would likely need to import spent fuel from other states. Will this be acceptable to the host community and the state?

Fourth, the plan for six SMRs (enough to power 1.5 million homes) creates a significant resilience challenge. Concentrating so much generation in one location introduces a major point of failure. If the plant goes off-line, half the state could lose power.

Finally, large energy “parks” inevitably attract large consumers such as data centers, increasing demand and potentially requiring yet more power plants. If Indiana needs power, consider weatherization and solar first. If it really wants nuclear, why not consider proven, commercial-scale designs rather than experimental ones?

Indiana deserves a full, transparent evaluation of the benefits, risks and alternatives, not just optimistic projections.",https://www.ibj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/og-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:39.484697
,EPA,2025-11-21 22:54:53+00:00,"Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.",TSCA PFAS Reporting: Implications of EPA's New Statutory Interpretation on Articles,Lynn L. Bergeson,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/tsca-pfas-reporting-implications-of-epas-new-statutory-interpretation-on-articles/,"At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule.
Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers.
Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule.
Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections.
In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles.","Headlines regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) most recent proposed update to the one-time per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) have been dominated by the rule’s new exemptions and the significant narrowing of responsibility and burden that industry stakeholders will face if the rule becomes final. But, buried in the preambular text — Unit III.A.2 to be precise — are a few paragraphs that caught our attention: a proposed interpretation that EPA lacks statutory authority to require reporting by those who import PFAS in articles.

EPA now states that the law is “best read as excluding articles and targeting the reporting requirement to manufacturers of the PFAS themselves.” EPA rationalizes that Congress “could have said so” if it desired the reporting requirements to extend to those who import articles containing PFAS. In EPA’s words: “[w]here Congress omits expansive modifiers, they should not be inferred.” It is worth mentioning that the argument itself is not new; EPA received some public comment to this effect on the original 2021 proposed rule. In the 2023 final rule and response to comments document, EPA disagreed and defended its authority, citing the decades-long interpretation that “manufacture of a chemical substance” under TSCA includes import of an article containing the chemical substance.

More than five years of regulatory development activity have transpired since Congress enacted the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that added TSCA Section 8(a)(7) and directed EPA to undertake rulemaking to collect more information on PFAS. EPA’s estimated burdens with respect to articles importers in the 2021 proposed rule drew significant criticism, prompting EPA to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel in 2022, update its economic analysis to inform the 2023 final rule, and develop numerous guidance materials to assist articles importers with compliance responsibilities. Stakeholders were correct to note that EPA has excluded articles from various other regulatory contexts, including chemical data reporting (CDR) under TSCA Section 8(a) and premanufacture notice review of new chemicals. When EPA Administrator Zeldin announced in 2025 that EPA would implement the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements “smartly” and “without overburdening small businesses and article importers,” many in the TSCA community expected some regulatory relief. The proposed rule, however, takes it even one step further.

As indicated in Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.’s recent analysis of the proposed rule, we found EPA’s new position — that it previously exceeded its own statutory authority in requiring articles importers to report under TSCA — to be quite notable. And while EPA requested feedback on the argument, it also concurrently proposed to exempt articles importers, citing TSCA Section 8(a)(5) and arguing that such entities are less likely to have responsive information, effectively doubling down on its effort to exclude articles importers from scope. We remind readers that in the 2023 final rule, EPA estimated that only 10 percent of small articles importers would have information to report on PFAS in imported articles; the remaining 90 percent would undergo due diligence and compliance burdens only to determine they lack responsive information. Whether the data that might be reported justify the (likely futile) effort of the 90 percent is a legitimate area of disagreement and one that this Administration has decided is not worth the burden on small businesses.

At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule. Future would-be challengers to this rule will have to convince a court both that (1) EPA has statutory authority to require reporting from articles importers, and (2) EPA’s application of discretion under TSCA Section 8(a)(5) to exempt articles importers was inappropriate. Considering this, we would not expect EPA to collect information on how PFAS might be entering the United States through imported articles any time soon. Similarly, given the data-driven nature of rulemaking, any future regulatory efforts on PFAS under TSCA are not likely to focus on exposures from imported articles either.

Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers. Although the discussion in the proposed rule is framed narrowly (i.e., only in the context of the specific language in TSCA Section 8(a)(7)), the underlying rationale used by EPA could be applied to other instances in TSCA that refer to “manufacture of a chemical substance” without a corresponding reference to “articles.” Applying EPA’s new reasoning, for example, one could argue that Congress never intended EPA’s existing chemical risk evaluations to consider import of articles containing a chemical as a “condition of use.” Congress could have mentioned “articles” — but did not — when it defined “conditions of use” in the 2016 amendments to govern the scope of existing chemical reviews. Congress also did not include expansive modifiers like “contain” or “including imported articles” when it charged EPA to regulate “manufacture…of a chemical substance” that presents an unreasonable risk under TSCA Section 6(a). Although there are specific mentions of “article” in TSCA Section 3 definitions of “process” and “distribute in commerce,” and in specific other aspects of TSCA Sections 5 and 6, the word “article” does not appear in TSCA’s definition of “manufacture” — the statutory term encompassing import of chemical substances into the United States.

Of course, such a position would not be without controversy. Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule. For example, the statutory definition of “chemical substance” in Section 3 does not generally exclude articles, and the specific exclusion for some articles in that definition (e.g., firearms) could imply that Congress contemplated the term “chemical substance” otherwise to be inclusive of chemicals contained in articles. Likewise, other provisions in the law, e.g., TSCA Sections 5(a)(5) and 6(a)(3), give EPA explicit authority to protect against risk and require warnings (respectively) for chemicals in articles. TSCA Section 6(c) includes some specific limitations on regulation of chemicals in articles (e.g., replacement parts), which arguably would not be necessary if Congress did not intend to convey statutory authority to address chemicals in articles in different ways in different sections of the statute.

Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections. In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles. Any changes in EPA’s statutory interpretations are worth keeping an eye on and could have profound implications regarding the scope and reach of future TSCA actions.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature_EPA_building.png,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:20.551301

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Both of you have added newsletters in recent years focused on state politics.","Local news is a tough business these days, with journalists routinely laid off (including some this month at the company that owns The (Raleigh) News & Observer) and small-town newspapers closing up shop.

But North Carolina’s journalism scene does have success stories, including two locally owned media companies that are seeing growth.

David Woronoff owns The Pilot, a thriving newspaper in Southern Pines, and magazines including Business North Carolina and Walter. Kyle Villemain started The Assembly in 2021, and it’s since grown to a staff of 43 people producing in-depth stories on all things North Carolina.

Both companies are adding to the state’s political news coverage (each has a politics newsletter for paid subscribers), and they’re expanding into underserved areas of the state.

Woronoff recently launched a new magazine called EastBound, covering communities east of Interstate 95, and Villemain has added a newsroom in Greensboro and a newsletter covering Cary and western Wake County.

Both joined this week's episode of the WUNC Politics Podcast to discuss their publications and the state of the news media in North Carolina.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What's allowed you to grow instead of shrink?

Woronoff: ""So many of the problems that our industry faces are self-imposed, and you could lay it at the feet of private equity ownership of news organizations, where the ownership is disengaged from the local community. Ours is locally and independently owned, and I believe that is the key to our success.""

Villemain: ""I also think that people respond when you put a really good product out there, when you put good reporting out there, whether it just really speaks to what they see in their community, if it speaks to what they see in their business, if it makes them feel more informed and more curious about the state — and it's just really good. People have a good eye for quality, and I think the news business has oftentimes not put out as high quality of a product as they think they are, and people respond by not engaging.""

I've been tracking the increase in news deserts and some of the more rural pockets of the state. I'm curious to what extent your organizations' models may be able to be replicated in other places.

Woronoff: ""As much as I'd like to say, 'oh yes, you could just pick ours up and drop it in Roanoke Rapids, or Laurinburg or Rockingham,' it's not that simple. We are blessed with a wonderfully vibrant local business community, and I think you have to have that. If you have a lot of corporately owned retail enterprises, it's a much harder sales environment.""

Villemain: ""I think there's at least a dozen markets across the state that can build substantial reporting teams on the ground. There's a lot of space for more growth from us, from others across North Carolina. I don't have a solution for every county, but there are a lot of mid-sized metros across North Carolina that don't have many full-time reporters, and that's a darn good place for entrepreneurs and existing outlets to start by saying, 'how do we build a three, four or five-person team that can give this county or city a thing that they don't have right now?'""

Both of you have added newsletters in recent years focused on state politics. Where have you seen unmet needs in political coverage that you've been able to fill?

Villemain: ""There's tons of gaps in political coverage, and there are great politics reporters out there, but there aren't enough of them, and there aren't enough doing deep backstories on complicated questions. We're not here to do the 'what happened today?' story — there are folks out there doing that. We are here to do the 'why did that happen and what's coming next?'""

Woronoff: ""We are the outlet that's going to tell you what happened today or yesterday or tomorrow. We're not doing the long-form journalism. ...

The company’s $1.1 billion, fully vertically integrated facility spans 2.4 million square feet, or about 11 times the size of the stadium’s main arena.

The factory began production quietly in July, a few months ahead of schedule, and employs more than 700 people. First Solar expects that number to hit 826 by the end of the year. Once it’s fully online, the site will add 3.5 GW of annual manufacturing capacity. That brings the company’s total US footprint to 14 GW in 2026 and 17.7 GW in 2027, when its newly announced South Carolina plant is anticipated to come online.

The Louisiana plant produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using US-made materials — glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel from Mississippi, which is fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

The new factory leans heavily on AI, from computer vision that spots defects on the line to deep learning tools that help technicians make real‑time adjustments.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry says the investment is already a win for the region, bringing in “hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses.” A new economic impact analysis from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette projects that the factory will boost Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4% in its first full year at capacity. The average manufacturing compensation package comes in at around $90,000, more than triple the parish’s per capita income.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar framed the new facility as a major step for US clean energy manufacturing: “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

This site joins what’s already the largest solar manufacturing and R&D footprint in the Western Hemisphere: three factories in Ohio, one in Alabama, and R&D centers in Ohio and California. Just last week, First Solar announced a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore more Series 6 module work. By the end of 2026, the company expects to directly employ more than 5,500 people across the US.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight.
Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad.
Individual Member Oversight Powers In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees.
Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members.","Several disputes have arisen in the 119th Congress surrounding access by Members of Congress to federal buildings. On several occasions, Members have been denied entry to various agency offices, and at least one Member was forcibly removed from an agency press conference in a federal building. A group of Members sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after they were refused access to immigration facilities, and, in a separate incident, one Member has been indicted for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred while attempting to inspect an ICE facility.

These controversies—which, though not novel, appear to be occurring with more frequency—seem to stem not only from differing interpretations of federal law by the executive and legislative branches but also from an interbranch disagreement over a Member's role in overseeing executive activities. The executive branch has at times asserted that agencies retain authority to control access to their buildings and that individual Members of Congress generally ""do not have the authority to conduct oversight"" except through an authorized committee investigation. Some Members, on the other hand, have argued for a legal right to access federal property that stems from federal statute and their individualized constitutional authority both to inform themselves on legislative matters and conduct oversight of the executive's implementation of federal law.

This Sidebar addresses this disagreement by discussing legal principles that govern the exercise of oversight by individual Members. Members of both chambers and both parties have long engaged in their own efforts to inform themselves of agency activity and confirm that a given executive agency is implementing the law in a way that comports with that Member's view of the statutory powers that Congress has entrusted to that agency. The courts have also recognized, in various contexts, that investigating and overseeing the executive branch is part of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight. There are few federal laws or chamber rules that directly and explicitly empower Members to act unilaterally to obtain information from the executive branch and perhaps one lawthat explicitly governs Member access to federal facilities for oversight purposes. (In that case, the provision applies only to certain Department of Homeland Security immigration centers.) Instead, House and Senate rules and federal statutes that delegateformal investigatory and oversight authority generally do so to committees and committee chairs. While either chamber could vest each of its Members with compulsory investigative tools—for example, by providing all Members with the power to issue subpoenas or establishing a broad-based right of access to federal property—neither the House nor the Senate has explicitly done so. As a result, although individual Members possess an implicit constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch and inform themselves of matters of legislative importance, they do not appear to have easy access to the tools that may allow them to overcome an agency's resistance to their information-gathering efforts.

Congressional Oversight Powers and Limits

As analyzed in greater detail in other CRS products, both the House and Senate have an implied constitutional power to investigate matters relating to their legislative functions—a power that includes conducting oversight of the executive branch. The Supreme Court has described this power as ""broad"" and one that ""encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes."" To effectively perform its legislative responsibilities, the Court has recognizedthat Congress must know whether an agency's functions are ""being properly discharged or . . . neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether [agency officials are] performing or neglecting their duties.""

Each chamber has delegatedthis constitutional ""power of inquiry,"" including the tools necessary to gather information, to its standing committees through House or Senate rules. Under these rules, committees may conduct investigations, hold hearings, call witnesses, take depositions, and issue and enforce subpoenas, and under federal statute, committees are to use their powers and tools to ""review and study, on a continuing basis,"" the implementation of law by federal agencies.

Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and it therefore generally does not conduct the type of physical search that, by comparison, is typical of an executive branch criminal investigation. Still, Congress gathers information necessary to inform and support its various legislative functions in many ways. For example, though not explicitly referenced in House or Senate rules, site visits and inspections of federal property have long been one tool in Congress's oversight toolbox. This practice likely derives from a combination of Congress's implicit oversight powers and its explicit constitutional authority to ""make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting . . . Property belonging to the United States."" As described in a recent filingby a group of Members denied access to ICE facilities, examples of ""on the ground oversight"" can be traced back to investigations by the Continental Congress and were a prominent part of the investigation into wartime waste during World War II conducted by the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (Truman Committee). Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad. Members undertook similar investigative activities during the Civil War, when Members of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Civil War inspected ""Camp Convalescent"" in Alexandria, VA, following allegations of unacceptable conditions at that military hospital. In-person site visits, of both government and private property, remain a regular feature of modern congressional investigations.

In addition to this practice, courts have also recognized field investigations and inspections as a component of congressional fact-finding. In McSurely v McClellan, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) announced that it had ""no doubt that information gathering,"" by either ""field work"" or ""field investigations"" by a committee Member or his staff, ""is essential to informed deliberation over proposed legislation"" and that ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct.""

The House and Senate have not, however, provided their committees with limitless investigative power. Committees may only use compulsory tools that have been given to them by their parent chamber, and then only when investigating matters within the committee's delegated jurisdiction—or, put another way, they are ""restricted to the missions delegated to them."" In practice, Congress's constitutional powers of investigation and oversight are typically carried out by committees under the powers and restraints provided by House and Senate rules.

Individual Member Oversight Powers

In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees. An individual Member (other than a committee chair if delegated that authority by the parent chamber or by the rules of their committee) may not unilaterally convene an official committee hearing, initiate an official committee investigation, issue a subpoena, or seek enforcement of a subpoena through contempt.

Nevertheless, these specific and formal powers represent a small portion of what may be considered congressional ""oversight."" Every Member of Congress has the ability, as ""an officer of the union, deriving his powers and qualifications from the Constitution,"" to leverage their position to influence agency action or gather information necessary to do their job. Also, though the Constitution does not vest the legislative power ""in any one individual,"" the ""action of the body as a whole"" requires the consent of ""the aggregate of the members who compose the body."" As explainedby the D.C. Circuit, ""[a]ll Members have a constitutionally recognized status entitling them to share in general congressional powers and responsibilities, many of them requiring access to executive information."" Each individual Member therefore participates in the exercise of Congress's legislative and investigative powers. It would appear that the same can be said for the exercise of committee power: though investigative jurisdiction and authorities have been delegated to committees, each Member of the committee shares in that power, and ""each is entitled to request such information from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a legislator.""

Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions

While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members. For example, some provisions of federal law require agencies to disclose specific types of information ""upon request of any Member of Congress."" Another law, 5 U.S.C. § 2954, requires agencies to comply with requests for information made by seven Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform or five members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Various agency regulations similarly recognize an individual Member's right of access to certain types of information, and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, though noting that individual Members have generally not been delegated investigative powers, nevertheless has reasoned that Members' requests should be given ""due weight and sympathetic consideration"" out of ""respect for the legislative functions of individual members.""

Relevant to many of the ongoing disputes, Congress has also used its power of the purse to support Member oversight activities. Since 2019, Congress has repeatedly enacted an appropriations provision that affirms the right of Members to physically inspect certain immigration facilities for oversight purposes. The initial law prohibited the use of appropriated funds to ""prevent a Member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house alien minors."" Congress later expandedthat law to prohibit the use of funds to deny Members access to ""any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens."" The current appropriations restriction also explicitly provides that ""[n]othing in this section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice"" of their intent to enter such a facility, though DHS may require that congressional staff provide the agency with 24 hours' notice.

Enforcement of Oversight Requests

Ultimately, the primary distinction between the exercise of investigative powers by the House or Senate (through its committees) and individual Members is that committees have the power and tools (albeit with limitations) to overcome resistance to their oversight efforts and enforce their demands for information. Committees can compel compliance with their requests by issuing subpoenas and enforcing those subpoenas (with the approval of the parent chamber) either in court or through criminal contempt of Congress referrals. Members, on the other hand, generally cannot utilize these mechanisms. Even when acting pursuant to statutory powers, Members have often struggled to enforce their rights. While Members may request information from an agency and exert various forms of pressure to increase the likelihood of compliance with their requests, they generally have not been able to legally compel an agency, in court or otherwise, to disclose information that the agency is otherwise reluctant to produce. As described by the D.C. Circuit: ""disclosure of information can only be compelled by authority of Congress, its committees or subcommittees, not solely by individual members . . . . Election to the Congress does not give an individual subpoena power over whatever information he may happen to be interested in.""

Whether the difficulties that Members have experienced in enforcing other oversight rights may also be apparent in field investigations may be answered by the pending litigation brought by individual Members of Congress who were denied access to ICE facilities. That case includes the added complexity that it is at least partly founded on the appropriations provision discussed above, which is phrased as a prohibition on the use of funds rather than an explicit grant of authority to individual Members. One federal district court has stated that, as a result of the provision, Members are ""statutorily authorized to enter and inspect"" covered facilities ""to conduct oversight.""

Even with its greater authority, a committee acting pursuant to an authorized investigation may still have some difficulty enforcing a request for access to government property because the typical enforcement tools may not be available in that context. The subpoena is a committee's traditional means of compulsion, but subpoenas generally only come in two forms: subpoenas ad testificandum, or demands for testimony, and subpoenas duces tecum, or demands for records or other evidence. While congressional committees have attempted to use subpoenas in a variety of ways—for example, to prevent the removal of life support or to compel a witness to sign a document that would provide the Congress with access to an overseas bank account—it is not clear how a subpoena could be used to gain physical access to a site. Securing such access, therefore, may require the use of other forms of legislative leverage or litigating any constitutional power or statutory right in court.

Informal Member Fact-Finding and the Speech or Debate Clause

While it is generally recognized that conducting oversight of executive branch activities is one of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress as described above, judicial decisions interpreting the legal protections that the Speech or Debate Clause (Clause) affords Members in exercising that oversight responsibility have injected some confusion into this area of law.

The Clause largely immunizes Members from criminal and civil liability predicated on their ""legislative acts."" The types of actions that the Clause protects go well beyond formal ""Speech or Debate"" in the halls of Congress to include any action that is an ""integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes"" through which Congress implements ""matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.""

The Supreme Court has held that investigative and oversight actions sanctioned by either the House or Senate or a congressional committee are the type of activities that receive the protections of the Clause. As a result, courts have interpreted actions taken by individual Members in the course of an authorized congressional investigation (for example at hearings, in issuing subpoenas, or pursuing contempt) as protected ""legislative acts.""

Some courts have been less receptive to interpreting the Clause to protect informal investigative and oversight actions undertaken by individual Members outside of authorized committee investigations. While these interactions are generally viewed as ""official"" and ""legitimate,"" they have not always been viewed as ""legislative"" for purposes of the Clause. The Supreme Court has saidthat efforts to influence how the executive branch implements or administers the laws enacted by Congress (a common and legitimate oversight activity) are not ""integral"" to the legislative function and not protected by the Clause, at least when conducted ""informally"" by an individual Member. As stated by the Supreme Court: ""Members of Congress are constantly in touch with the Executive Branch of the Government and with administrative agencies—they may cajole, and exhort with respect to the administration of a federal statute—but such conduct, though generally done, is not protected legislative activity.""

There is also some disagreement among the courts as to whether a Member's efforts to gather information from an agency necessary to assist in their legislative duties (as opposed to seeking to influence agency conduct) is protected legislative activity. Some courts do not view informal actions by individual Members as ""integral to the legislative process"" for purposes of the Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, for example, has held that ""informal information gathering—either personally by a member of Congress or by congressional aides""—is not protected legislative activity. That court, however, acknowledged that information gathering ""is a proper congressional function and, when conducted by a committee, should be treated just as voting and debating legislation.""

That said, most courts have held that this type of informal fact-finding is a protected legislative act, regardless of whether that fact-finding is undertaken as part of an authorized committee investigation. The D.C. Circuit, for example, has articulatedthat ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct and thus should be within the ambit of [the Clause's] privilege so that congressmen are able to discharge their constitutional duties properly."" In another case, United States v. Biaggi, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that ""legislative factfinding activity conducted"" by an individual Member during a trip ""to inspect and visit"" state agencies in Florida in preparation for a congressional hearing was protected legislative activity. This recognition of the importance of legislative fact-finding by individual Members is consistent with the position generally taken by Members that, as constitutionally elected officers of the legislative branch, they may engage in oversight and investigations and are entitled to access necessary information.

Similarly, in McSurely, the D.C. Circuit recognized Member and staff ""field work"" and ""field investigations"" as protected legislative activities. At the same time, the court also clarifiedthat ""a Member of Congress or congressional employee is not free to use every conceivable means to obtain investigatory materials without fear of criminal prosecution or civil suit."" In that case, a Senate committee staff member traveled to Kentucky to view, collect, and transport back to Washington, DC, information that allegedly had been unlawfully obtained from an individual by state authorities and was subject to a court order of confidentiality due to Fourth Amendment concerns. Though acknowledging the committee staffer was engaged in informal fact-finding, the court nevertheless held that ""the employment of unlawful means to implement an otherwise proper legislative objective is simply not 'essential to legislating'"" and therefore was not protected by the Clause.

Most recently, in a federal criminal prosecution of a sitting Member of Congress, the Department of Justice acknowledged, and the federal district court agreed, that the Member's oversight and fact-finding inspection of a federal immigration facility was a protected legislative act. In that case, however, the court found that a physical altercation with law enforcement that took place ""during a brief time frame before the oversight inspection began"" was ultimately not a protected legislative act. That case remains ongoing.

While these cases are useful in understanding the scope of legislative power, especially absent cases dealing directly with individual Member oversight, the Clause acts primarily as a shield against intrusion by other branches into legislative acts: it is a protection; not a source of authority. For this reason, Speech or Debate Clause principles have played a significant role in recent executive branch efforts to either investigate or prosecute conduct that Members have described as information gathering—including the government's attempt, as referenced above, to prosecute a Member for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred during an oversight visit to an ICE facility.

Whether informal fact-finding activity is entitled to Speech or Debate Clause protections does not dispositively determine whether such activity is within a Member's authority. The fact that a certain activity may not qualify as legislative for purposes of the Clause does not necessarily mean that activity is unauthorized. The Court has made clear that some unprotected acts, though not deemed legislative, may still be within a Member's official responsibilities. The reverse is also true: the fact that a certain activity is considered legislative does not mean that it is authorized. Unauthorized acts—even some criminal acts—can still be protected legislative acts under the Clause.

Conclusion

Oversight of the executive branch is an essential aspect of the legislative function. While Congress has provided many of the compulsory investigative tools that support its oversight efforts to committees, individual Members nevertheless appear to retain the ability to conduct their own investigations and gather their own information, including through field investigations and site visits. Still, there are significant distinctions between committee investigations and individual Member investigations. Members have limited means available to enforce their particular investigative requests and, under the Speech or Debate Clause, may not always receive immunity for their otherwise legitimate investigative actions.",https://www.congress.gov/img/opengraph1200by630.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:06.787443

It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.
“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental.
Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities.","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (CA-26) released the following statement after the Trump administration announced plans to allow new oil and gas drilling off the California Coast for the first time in decades.

“The Trump administration has made its priorities unmistakably clear: rolling back protections, dismantling safeguards, and putting the interests of wealthy donors and powerful corporations before the health, safety, and future of the American people. That includes dragging our nation back to a time when rivers caught fire, smog choked our cities, and California’s iconic coastline was wide open to offshore oil and gas drilling, and we know all too well what that means.

“Oil spills have caused some of the worst environmental catastrophes in our nation’s history. While the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill occurred just north of California’s 26th Congressional District, its devastation is part of our region’s collective memory. That disaster was so profound that it transformed how our government oversees environmental protection for the offshore energy industry. It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.

“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental. Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities. It endangers local economies that rely on clean water and healthy ecosystems, including tourism, fishing, outdoor recreation, and the jobs that come with them. It also threatens the backbone of Ventura County’s $2 billion agricultural economy. Our farmers and farmworkers depend on clean water, healthy soil, and stable ecosystems to grow the crops that feed our country.

“An offshore spill could contaminate irrigation sources, damage coastal farmland, and jeopardize thousands of jobs across California’s Central Coast, and these harms are not borne equally. Low-income communities, communities of color, and the workers who power our agricultural and coastal economies, like Oxnard, the largest city in my district and one of the larger coastal cities in California, suffer first and worst from pollution, toxic exposure, and environmental degradation.

“Environmental justice demands that we prevent new harms — not repeat the failures of the past. At a time when the U.S. is already the world’s leading producer of oil and gas, when major oil companies are raking in record profits, and when most federal acres leased to industry sit unused, there is no justification for putting California’s coast back on the chopping block — except to serve corporate interests.

“Let me be absolutely clear: my Democratic colleagues and I stand united. We are committed to confronting this administration’s assault on our environment and standing up to the corporate interests trying to write our nation’s energy policy.

“We will fight back, not quietly, not halfway, but with the full force of our values and our conviction, because our coast, our communities, and our climate are worth every ounce of that fight.”

New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said.
Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together.
Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills.
“It was a process failure, it was a transparency failure, it was a democracy failure,” Rubio said.","Two southern New Mexico state representatives on Thursday evening told their constituents that they view Project Jupiter, the massive data center for which elected county leaders approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds, as a transparency failure that “sidelined” the community.

Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) spoke at a Thursday event hosted by the nonprofit organization New Mexico Water Advocates and expressed apprehensions that Project Jupiter’s plans to generate natural gas and tap into the region’s troubled water utility will exacerbate regional pollution and strain a water system that’s already pushed to the limit.

Rubio noted that she has seen several recent headlines questioning whether the nation is on the brink of an artificial intelligence bubble and characterized the decision to approve $165 billion for an OpenAI and Oracle data center as a “gamble.”

Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

“When the industry itself is signaling instability…it’s reckless for public institutions to lock themselves into these long-term subsidies and abatements and these water commitments. New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said. “For New Mexicans, there has been this long history of being told that the next big thing is what’s going to save us, whether it has been Spaceport, whether it was Virgin Galactic, Facebook, film incentives pitched as these permanent engines…now it’s Project Jupiter.”

Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together. They also question whether the project’s $360 million payment in lieu of taxes — spread out over 30 years — is a fair return for $165 billion.

“When I first heard that the payment in lieu of taxes was going to be $360 million, I assumed that was annually,” Lara Cadena, who also serves as vice chair on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee, said. “To see that our county commission signed a deal to receive so little, I was just stunned.”

Critics take issue with the data center’s energy source, in particular. Plans call for a natural gas generating “microgrid,” a system that can solely rely on its own power rather than drawing from an existing grid. Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills. But critics say the 2025 law that governs microgrids appears to exempt them from complying with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act — which requires that utilities use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% renewable energy by 2040 — until 2045, when it would be required to use fully renewable energy.

Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislative language in question, has previously disputed that characterization to Source New Mexico and insisted that the development must comply with every aspect of the clean energy law.

The costs of what was going to go into a data center need to be more transparent.
In Ohio, they passed a law requiring data center companies to pay for a high percentage of the power they’re using.
So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them.
Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to.","Tell me more about how you started focusing on data centers.

So, in Fairfax County, in 2020 or 2021, people were pursuing the construction of an indoor ski facility on a landfill. From a climate perspective, to build something that would need to be cooled 24/7 for indoor skiing seemed like a very bad proposal in terms of energy usage. And for what kind of gain?

Then our friends at the Sierra Club were saying, indoor ski slopes? Bad, yes. But data centers? Way, way worse. Those aren’t cooling to support snow but are cooling much larger areas on a much larger scale, dwarfing the area of that one ski slope. This was around the time the Prince William Digital Gateway was showing up – they were saying all these acres of agricultural lands and single-family housing zones were about to be rezoned. This was a big deal, and Sierra Club led the way in opening our eyes to this. The rezoning ultimately passed. The data centers were sued and the people who filed the lawsuit won, but pre-planning for the centers is still allowed to take place.

The way we think about the impacts of data centers, besides the loss of natural lands and the amount of energy that’s going to be needed to power these things, has been diesel generators. These are the things that are backup generation and the camel’s nose under the tent is trying to get them to be primary power.

Now I want to ask you a provocative question: is there any middle ground between letting these projects be built unfettered and outright bans on their development?

We have no regulation today. From our standpoint, these things are coming, they’re here. We know a lot more now than we did in 2022. As we make decisions about how and where to build these facilities we all need – I mean we’re using one right now. I use a data center all day at work. Teams conferencing. ChatGPT to answer a question. We need these. So if we’re going to build them, let’s not give a pass to some of the world’s largest and richest companies. Let’s ask them to put the guardrails on to protect our residences and our infrastructure to make sure they’re as sustainable as possible.

Okay, so what are the guardrails then?

The costs of what was going to go into a data center need to be more transparent. We need to bring accountability to the forefront right away as they’re being built.

In Ohio, they passed a law requiring data center companies to pay for a high percentage of the power they’re using. That cut a significant number of the projects in Ohio. This industry is so speculative and a land grab and a rush to be first to get the most.

You have this dichotomy of land values for residences being inundated, while land values for developers are skyrocketing. We have an affordability crisis going on and we are all on the hook for paying for the infrastructure to power these things.

So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them. Let’s get rid of some of the incentives for power users. We don’t need to be encouraging the loss of state revenue, either – we’re leaving money on the table to bring these facilities here.

Lastly, our readers love to get hyperlocal. I know you’re intently focused on Fairfax County right now which has been a big part of the data center boom in Virginia – what’s happening there?

There are a couple things that have happened over the course of this past year. Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to. The big thing with that one is, you have to have a special exception if you build within a mile of a Metro station. When you think about good land use and building a data center within a walkable distance of a Metro, that’s eye-openingly poor land use policy and a missed opportunity for transit-oriented development. It doesn’t mean they can’t be built near one but you have to get a special exception.

Some things can’t be regulated at the local level. Like generators. That’s in the hands of the state.

Last night, we had a public hearing at the Fairfax County board level for our policy plan – our comprehensive plan providing guidance for developers who want to get a special exception or rezoning. It is not law. It is not required. It is a visionary document that helps us get to better. They’ve added a section for data centers in that. In May, staff put forward something pretty good, making sure data centers met a minimum level of efficiency. But our chairman of the county board said it went above and beyond our zoning ordinance and said he didn’t think it was appropriate, so staff rewrote that section and stripped out a lot of the specificity and higher standards that were in that document.

At the hearing, they deferred a decision, listening to the public but not having a discussion at the board level. They’ve left the record open through December 9th.

As we chronicle time and time again in The Fight, residents in farming communities are fighting back aggressively – protesting, petitioning, suing and yelling loudly. Things have gotten so tense that some are refusing to let representatives for Piedmont’s developer, PSEG, onto their properties, and a court battle is currently underway over giving the company federal marshal protection amid threats from landowners.

Exacerbating the situation is a quirk we don’t often deal with in The Fight. Unlike energy generation projects, which are usually subject to local review, transmission sits entirely under the purview of Maryland’s Public Service Commission, a five-member board consisting entirely of Democrats appointed by current Governor Wes Moore – a rumored candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. It’s going to be months before the PSC formally considers the Piedmont project, and it likely won’t issue a decision until 2027 – a date convenient for Moore, as it’s right after he’s up for re-election. Moore last month expressed “concerns” about the project’s development process, but has brushed aside calls to take a personal position on whether it should ultimately be built.

Enter a potential Trump card that could force Moore’s hand. In early October, commissioners and state legislators representing Carroll County – one of the farm-heavy counties in Piedmont’s path – sent Trump a letter requesting that he intervene in the case before the commission. The letter followed previous examples of Trump coming in to kill planned projects, including the Grain Belt Express transmission line and a Tennessee Valley Authority gas plant in Tennessee that was relocated after lobbying from a country rock musician.

One of the letter’s lead signatories was Kenneth Kiler, president of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners, who told me this lobbying effort will soon expand beyond Trump to the Agriculture and Energy Departments. He’s hoping regulators weigh in before PJM, the regional grid operator overseeing Mid-Atlantic states. “We’re hoping they go to PJM and say, ‘You’re supposed to be managing the grid, and if you were properly managing the grid you wouldn’t need to build a transmission line through a state you’re not giving power to.’”

Part of the reason why these efforts are expanding, though, is that it’s been more than a month since they sent their letter, and they’ve heard nothing but radio silence from the White House.

“My worry is that I think President Trump likes and sees the need for data centers. They take a lot of water and a lot of electric [power],” Kiler, a Republican, told me in an interview. “He’s conservative, he values property rights, but I’m not sure that he’s not wanting data centers so badly that he feels this request is justified.”

Kiler told me the plan to kill the transmission line centers hinges on delaying development long enough that interest rates, inflation and rising demand for electricity make it too painful and inconvenient to build it through his resentful community. It’s easy to believe the federal government flexing its muscle here would help with that, either by drawing out the decision-making or employing some other as yet unforeseen stall tactic. “That’s why we’re doing this second letter to the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy asking them for help. I think they may be more sympathetic than the president,” Kiler said.

At the moment, Kiler thinks the odds of Piedmont’s construction come down to a coin flip – 50-50. “They’re running straight through us for data centers. We want this project stopped, and we’ll fight as well as we can, but it just seems like ultimately they’re going to do it,” he confessed to me.

Thus is the predicament of the rural Marylander. On the one hand, Kiler’s situation represents a great opportunity for a GOP president to come in and stand with his base against a would-be presidential candidate. On the other, data center development and artificial intelligence represent one of the president’s few economic bright spots, and he has dedicated copious policy attention to expanding growth in this precise avenue of the tech sector. It’s hard to imagine something less “energy dominance” than killing a transmission line.

WASHINGTON – Today, in coordination with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing its first quarterly public update detailing progress made towards implementing a permanent, 100% solution to the Tijuana River sewage crisis afflicting millions of Americans in Southern California. Today’s public update marks another milestone in implementing the historic Memorandum of Understanding EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra signed in Mexico City in July 2025.

“The Trump Administration committed to delivering an urgent and permanent 100% solution to the millions of people afflicted by this crisis, and it is critical that we are transparent with the public about ongoing projects as well as the status of upcoming projects. Our mission will not be accomplished until we reach the 100% solution,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “So far, we have successfully implemented this MOU well ahead of the projected timeline. We are committed to maintaining full transparency regarding both our current initiatives and the progress of future projects, ensuring the public stays informed about our ongoing efforts and planned developments. Safeguarding public health and environmental integrity stands as EPA's foremost responsibility, and every American deserves confidence in the safety of the air they inhale and the recreational areas they enjoy.”

“President Trump, EPA Administrator Zeldin, and the USIBWC are making real progress on a 100% solution to permanently eliminate American exposure to Mexican sewage from the Tijuana River,” said USIBWC Commissioner Chad McIntosh. “As we accelerate our infrastructure improvements at our San Diego plant, we will continue to monitor Mexico's progress to make sure they also urgently complete the work they agreed to do. This information will be shared with our stakeholders who support our commitment to finally solve the Tijuana River sewage crisis.”

Section 1(b) of the MOU requires the United States and Mexico to issue clear, coordinated, and at least quarterly updates to the public. This quarterly public update details the historic progress both nations have made towards fully and faithfully executing the MOU, including:

USIBWC completing a 10 million gallons per day (mgd) interim expansion of the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP);

Mexico initiating the construction of the First Phase of the Tijuana River Gates, a collection pipes project, with Mexican state and federal funds;

A U.S.-Mexico binational working group announcing timelines for key Minute 328 projects had been compressed by an additional 9 months;

USIBWC completing a nanobubble ozonation pilot project for the Tijuana River and starting to plan for an accelerated 50 mgd expansion of SBIWTP;

EPA and SEMARNAT developing strategies for operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and accounts; and

U.S. and Mexican Sections of the IBWC entering final negotiations for a new treaty “Minute.”

The MOU established a framework for permanent resolution through three critical priorities crucial to achieving a 100% solution to the transboundary pollution crisis:

Securing Mexico's Financial Commitments

Accelerating Project Timelines

Adding Other Necessary Projects that Factor in Future Population Growth in the Tijuana River Valley

Future projects and timelines include Mexico allocating the remaining Minute 328 funds as part of Mexico’s 2026-2027 budgets, including half (USD$46M) in 2026 and half (USD$47M) in 2027, to facilitate completion of the remaining Minute 328 projects by December 31, 2027, or sooner, in accordance with the following project priority schedule:

Construction in Calendar Year 2026:

Rehabilitation of the Insurgentes Collector;

Rehabilitation of PB Matadero and Laureles Pump Station 2;

Rehabilitation of Poniente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Oriente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Collector Carranza; and

Backup power supply for PB1.

Construction in Calendar Year 2027:

Upgrades to the Arturo Herrera and La Morita WWTPs;

International Collector Phase II;

Rehabilitation of the Antiguo Force Main

Lift station and force main from Sainz Canyon to Arturo Herrera; and

Enclose the open channel from PB1 to SAB WWTP.

December 31, 2027 is the deadline to complete all Minute 328 projects.

Administrator Zeldin made it clear when he signed this agreement that the only way to achieve this desired end goal is to have a plan that takes into account all three of these key pillars. Sacrificing one of them would mean the “100%” solution would not be reached.

Since signing this MOU in July, the Trump Administration has made historic progress on implementing the agreement. In August, EPA and IBWC announced the completion of a 10 mgd expansion of the SBIWTP, which will significantly reduce wastewater flowing into the Tijuana River and help eliminate foul smells that have long plagued San Diego area residents. This project was initially projected to take two years, but the Trump Administration completed it in 100 days. The U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is working closely with our local and Mexican partners as we enter the rainy season in the San Diego-Tijuana area. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to treat sewage from Tijuana at full capacity while we protect its infrastructure from excess sediment and trash that come with stormwater.

This public update provides further details on Mexico’s progress on meeting commitments the country agreed to in signing the MOU.

The next milestone will be the signing of a new “Minute” by the end of 2025. As the public update notes, the U.S. and Mexico sections of the IBWC are finalizing negotiations.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:43.285749

The plan would ensure the continued operation of the U.P.’s 13 Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) generators. Without imminent legislative intervention, the generators will soon be shut down due to new green energy mandates, leading to massive energy bill hikes for residents and businesses alike.

“The Senate must do the right thing and pass the U.P. energy protection plan before it’s too late. Without these RICE generators, the U.P. faces a collapse in every facet of daily life. Energy bills will skyrocket, leading businesses to close. When people lose jobs, they will most certainly leave. That mass exodus will leave schools and broader communities as shells of their former selves. Without reliable energy production, the U.P. will become a ghost peninsula.

“The Michigan Public Service Commission has even cited the effectiveness of the RICE units working in conjunction with a renewable energy portfolio due to the short time it takes the plants to ramp up and generate energy, helping to quickly make up for any energy shortfall.

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies.","The debate over future economic development in Lansing continues with far-reaching implications for business — a conversation lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer publicly said they expected to address before the end of the year, after passing the state budget.

The Detroit Regional Chamber continues to meet with and provide input to the leadership of both legislative chambers and the Governor’s office.

Where the issue stands: The leading economic development concept being discussed is a payroll tax credit. The House Republicans and Senate Democrats have each introduced their own versions. The basis of their proposals stem from the “Good Jobs for Michigan” package passed under then-Gov. Rick Snyder, but which has since expired.

As talks continue, the size and scope of both the House and Senate proposals remain in question and may not include a focus on large-scale projects like previous business incentives, such as the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund.

Why it matters: Global competition is ramping up with the onset of AI, digitalization, and automation, which are reshaping every industry. Site selectors analyze many factors when determining where to locate their next expansion, including the business climate, talent pool, and economic development incentives. With the expiration of SOAR at the end of 2025, Michigan needs to look at new forms of long-term, sustainable economic development incentives to compete for jobs and investment from other states and countries.

What it is: The Senate Democrats’ version of this payroll tax credit, called “More Jobs for Michigan” and introduced by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), creates a withholding tax capture that diverts 100% of employee income taxes to the employer. Additionally, it offers a retention credit for jobs that were at risk of leaving if the employer had not made the investment in the state.

How it works: To qualify for the credit, the employer must be generating 25 or more jobs and must be at 175% of the Detroit Region’s median wage, or have 250 or more jobs at 150%. Currently, 175% of the Region’s wage is about $90,000, and 150% is about $77,000. This package selects jobs that it would qualify as “good jobs,” preferring white-collar jobs in engineering and semiconductors over blue-collar assembly line work.

What they’re saying: “The focus is on looking at high-paying e-jobs and what we can do to incentivize those,” Singh said. “My package also takes a look at how you retain jobs, and especially in this environment with the tariffs and so forth. Having a retention strategy for companies that are based here in Michigan makes a lot of sense to me.”

What it is: A payroll tax credit called “Real Jobs for Michigan,” introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), creates a new income tax capture program for companies that create new full-time jobs paying 150% of the regional median wage, which is about $77,000 in the Detroit Region, the highest in the state, and as low as $63,000 in the Northeast Region.

How it works: The program is capped at $50 million annually through 2036, with $10 million allocated for businesses with fewer than 100 employees, $15 million allocated for businesses with between 100 and 999 employees, and $25 million allocated for businesses with more than 1,000 employees.

What they’re saying: “The biggest benefit to this is it’s not corporate welfare,” Hoadley said. “It’s not upfront taxpayer money. It is sincerely performance incentives that go right to job creators in this state.”

What it is: The House Republicans’ legislation aims to refinance the state’s remaining $1.62 billion MEGA obligation by extending the payment schedule from five years to ten years. The House package repeals the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) and eliminates the MEGA tax credits, which were negotiated with previous Governors and the state’s largest employers to retain critical employment numbers in the state.

Why it matters: MEGA credits have been utilized during critical periods in Michigan’s economy, notably at the end of the 20th century and during the Great Recession, when companies were considering relocating out of Michigan or offshore. Those businesses that negotiated their MEGA credits made a commitment to the state that they would retain those jobs for Michiganders in exchange for the incentive.

What they’re saying: “We’re not walking away from the [MEGA] commitment,” Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), the cosponsor of the legislation, said. “We’re simply going to restructure that and try to get that out in 10 payments over the next 10 years.”

What it is: Transformational brownfield plans are sales and use tax exemptions for developers of transformational projects on sites that would otherwise never have been redeveloped. The incentives are based on the project’s outcome and provide no upfront funding to developers.

Why it matters: Transformational brownfields have been around since 2017 and were essential in building Hudson’s Detroit. Without a level of incentive for redeveloping sites, vacant and polluted sites would remain undeveloped and leave urban cores with visible stains. The statewide cap was originally set at $800 million and then raised to $1.6 billion in 2023. The cap is $30 million away from being hit again, but multiple projects are being proposed, including the revitalization and partial demolition of the Renaissance Center property, which will easily exceed this.

What they’re saying: “This is a program that helped take our city from bankruptcy to a Top 50 place to visit in the world, and is enabling the same kind of transformation from west to east,” said Jared Fleisher, incoming Chief Executive Officer of Bedrock.

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies. The House Republicans have introduced legislation to disband the MEDC, which Whitmer has promised to veto if it were ever to clear the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Why it matters: The MEDC is the chief statewide entity charged with promoting economic growth in Michigan and does essential work to attract and retain businesses as well as promote the state and tourism.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lansing-aerial-feature.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:18.598251

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.
""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.
""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving.","There are well-known poster children for the transition to clean technologies. Norway, for its embrace of electric cars, Australia for rooftop solar and China for its colossal renewables industrial revolution.

But there are others that you might not have heard as much about.

Nepal, the landlocked Himalayan country, where 76 per cent of new cars are electric. Or Pakistan, where a homegrown solar boom has sprung up in response to rising energy prices.

Unshackled from established fossil-fuel industries and outdated technologies, these countries show how the global south is starting to move faster in the renewables transition than wealthier nations such as Australia. These shifts aren't being driven by climate motives, but rather energy security and economics.

In fact, the world is at a tipping point where renewable energy and electric cars are becoming so affordable that countries are leapfrogging the era of fossil fuels to go straight to green solutions, according to Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at global think tank Ember.

""The traditional way that people think about technology revolutions is they think that the rich countries do it first and then the technology makes it to the poor countries, which is what happened with the internet, for example,"" he says.

China as the centre of change

These developments would have been hard to fathom a decade ago.

China's rapid shift to renewables hasn't just transformed its own economy and started to eat into fossil fuel emissions at home; it's also building out that manufacturing capacity in other countries.

According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, since 2022 Chinese investments overseas have surged past $US220 billion ($340 billion) in manufacturing projects across batteries, solar, wind, electric cars and green hydrogen.

These investments are on top of the renewables and electric car products made in China and sold internationally.

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.

While these exports are going to every region, the benefits are most striking in their immediate neighbourhood, according to Mr Bond.

""A lot of the electrification stories are China-adjacent. What you're seeing — as so often in technology revolutions — is countries near the centre of change are moving quicker. We have a real story of Asian electrification going on,"" he says.

The problem with fossil fuels is that not everyone has them, unlike sunshine and wind. Countries that don't have them are dependent on expensive, and sometimes volatile, imports.

Some 80 per cent of the world lives in countries that import coal, gas, petrol and diesel to power their lives, whereas 92 per cent of countries have the potential to generate renewable energy more than 10 times their current demand, Mr Bond says.

""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.

""People will harness their own energy. What's changed is that the price has come down so much that it's become feasible.""

The potential for cheap, abundant and locally-grown renewable energy, coupled with the opportunity to unshackle from imported fossil fuels, has seen emerging markets starting to transition faster than the global north.

Think of it like going straight to mobile phones instead of getting a landline connected first.

Wesley Morgan, a climate diplomacy academic at UNSW and fellow at the Climate Council, says this is a game-changer for global development and bringing access to electricity everywhere.

""Energy poverty is obviously still a thing in many parts of the developing world, but rather than going via … large fossil-fuel infrastructure like coal-fired power plants and then shifting to renewables, the economics now mean that developing countries can just leapfrog straight to renewables,"" he says.

Around the world, the clean energy transition is taking off in emerging markets.

Pakistan's sudden spike in solar in recent years, without any specific government policies or incentives driving it, has puzzled the world. The country has increased its solar capacity fivefold since 2022, and solar is now Pakistan's largest source of energy, ranking it among the top 20 countries globally for solar capacity.

In Africa, solar imports from China have risen by 60 per cent in the past year alone, according to analysis from Ember.

In Nepal, the dependence on imported oil via India was the catalyst for its EV boom.

In 2015, India implemented an unofficial oil blockade, grinding much of Nepal's transport to a halt and forcing the country to innovate, according to Reihana Mohideen, an electrical engineer at the University of Melbourne who focuses on the energy transition.

""Fuel tankers stopped arriving. Vital supplies were cut off. Prices skyrocketed. People queued for days at petrol stations. Black market rates soared. Public transport ground to a halt and long periods of blackout on top of existing blackout conditions,"" she said.

""So under those conditions, Nepal decided to explore a different course and look at electric vehicles. And the government played a really important role here [with] policy and planning.""

The Nepalese government introduced a target of having 90 per cent of new cars sold as electric by 2030 and this year it already reached 76 per cent.

By comparison, in Australia, battery-electric cars make up about 9 per cent of new car sales, rising to 12 per cent when hybrids are included.

Last year, the Ethiopian government's ban on combustion cars led to a spike in EV sales. The country spends more than $US4.5 billion importing fuel every year.

For small, island countries dotted across the Pacific, renewables reduce dependence on expensive diesel imports for power generators, according to Dr Mohideen.

""Solar plays a very important role because the systems can be smaller, they're modular, they're cheaper. Globally, the average prices for solar are cheaper than for fossil fuels,"" she says.

This is another key benefit of renewable systems, especially solar: developing regions can electrify without building large infrastructure. It doesn't even necessarily require government intervention or programs.

""This is a story we're kind of seeing now happening all over the place, people … import solar panels from China, you stick it on the back of a moped, and you carry it into the countryside, and you just put it up,"" Mr Bond says.

He says not having to adapt older energy systems — as is the case in Australia —makes it easier for emerging economies.

""If you're Kenya or Vietnam or Paraguay and your energy use per capita is relatively low, you don't have a huge entrenched fossil fuel system, and therefore you actually can build your electricity system right first time,"" Mr Bond says.

Another leap forward in this space has been the cost of batteries.

""Solar has been great, but you can't store it. And now you can store it cheaply with cheap batteries. This combination of solar plus batteries it's just creating a very different environment everywhere across the world,"" Mr Bond says.

""And the combination of the two is really what will break the logjam of change.""

India, not following the path of China, critical for the climate

For the emerging economies of the global south, the imperative to invest in renewables isn't to address climate change, as many of them have negligible emissions now. However, these regions would otherwise have the biggest emissions growth in the coming decades.

Their goal is to improve living standards, and the world's climate future will heavily depend on whether that can be done without the emissions toll that established economies such as the US or Australia have had.

""Now we have these big economies like China, like India, like Brazil, like Indonesia. And we really need those economies to be rapidly shifting to renewables if we're going to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis,"" Dr Morgan says.

Take India, for example, which has the world’s biggest population and is undergoing rapid economic development.

""If that is a fossil fuel-powered development, then we cannot come close to meeting our shared climate goals. So we really need India to be shifting to do what China is doing now, not what China has done over the last 30 years.""

There are already positive signs. India's per-capita emissions are lower than China's when it reached a similar level of GDP.

""India is not going down the Chinese path. If they were … Indian coal use per capita would already be two or three times higher than it is today,"" Mr Bond says.

""The reason … is not necessarily because of the global warming issues, simply because they've got another alternative — they've got the solar option.""

Where does this leave us today with COP?

As COP30 draws to a close, a lot of focus has been on the big emitters and the absence of the United States.

Corrêa do Lago, this year's COP president, stirred mixed reactions when he called out wealthy nations at the start of the summit.

""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving. It is not just this year — it has been moving for years, but it did not have the exposure that it has now,"" he told reporters in Belém.

Dr Morgan says there has always been tension between wealthy countries and the global south, with the expectation that developed countries needed to cut their emissions first.

""Essentially, the idea is that rich countries are supposed to move first, cutting their emissions and even more that they're supposed to provide finance to developing countries to help them with their energy transition and later coping with the impacts and adapting to climate change,"" he says.

""What [they] want to see is polluting nations paying for the loss and damage caused by their pollution, and also helping to provide climate finance to help with adaptation.""

This year's COP was dubbed an ""implementation COP"" because the focus has not been on reaching an agreement but instead on making sure countries are delivering on their existing commitments.

For Mr Bond that is fundamentally changing the role of governments in climate action.

""The function of governments was to spark this change. And now that they've done that, they need to get out of the way, actually, and allow it to happen,"" he says.

But for Dr Mohideen, governments are still critical for ensuring the transition is as smooth and equitable as possible.

""In a lot of countries … there's a gap between policies that exist and what's happening on the ground in terms of new renewable energy systems and programs being rolled out,"" she says.

“Political will is necessary to develop strong policy.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a078f7cb8feb59b517b87a7d16af05cd?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2132&cropW=3791&xPos=0&yPos=197&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:24.708017

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.","What is the future of renewables in New Hampshire, and how can citizens help make it happen?

The future of renewable energy in New Hampshire will depend on community collaboration, smarter energy management and policy changes that support local projects, according to speakers at a Community Conversation on Wednesday hosted by the Monadnock Center for History and Culture and the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript.

Speakers said residents can support renewable energy by enrolling in demand response programs, using smart thermostats, supporting warrant articles for municipal projects, and advocating for policy changes such as higher net metering caps.

The panel featured Gabe Chelius, a circuit rider for Clean Energy New Hampshire; Jennifer Runyon of Eversource’s Demand Response Team; and Dan Weeks, vice president of business development for ReVision Energy.

Chelius said his organization helps municipalities and small businesses identify, plan and finance energy-saving and renewable-energy projects, and connects them with contractors, grant opportunities and model warrant articles. He said that some recent projects will generate substantial long-term savings for small businesses.

When asked by Monadnock Center for History and Culture Director Michelle Stahl about help specifically for nonprofits, Chelius admitted that there is not a lot of help for that sector in terms of grant funding, calling it the “biggest gap” in the funding opportunities that Clean Energy New Hampshire tracks.

“There simply aren’t enough programs to help them,” Chelius said. “It’s a huge issue; there’s a massive void.”

Runyon spoke about the purpose of the Demand Response Team, which she said was about taking demand off the grid during peak hours. She said that the entire grid is sized to meet its peak demand, even though it does not need that capacity most of the time.

“And so, if the peak demand keeps growing, we have to keep growing the grid,” Runyon explained.

Eversource’s voluntary demand response program allows the utility to make minor adjustments to participating residents’ smart thermostats or home battery systems during peak hours, typically early evenings in the summer.

“One person doing that is not going to save a lot of energy, but when you have 100,000, which demand response does, it makes a difference,” Runyon said.

Runyon said participation at scale reduces stress on the grid and can limit costly upgrades. Residents who enroll get a stipend — $50 for smart thermostats and $3,000 for eligible battery systems. Runyon said the company buys back battery power in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but not yet in New Hampshire, though the stipend is calculated to cover the average price of the electricity generated.

Weeks said New Hampshire trails neighboring states in solar adoption due to state policies.

“So it’s not geography, it’s not climate — it’s policy,” Weeks said.

One way to open up new solar projects is to increase the net metering cap for solar power generation for all systems. Weeks pointed to the state’s 1-megawatt cap on community solar projects for residential and commercial users. Larger systems up to 5 megawatts are allowed only for municipalities and school districts. Legislative efforts to raise those caps are underway.

Weeks also noted that the federal 30 percent solar investment tax credit, which has helped reduce the upfront cost of installations, expires at the end of the year, likely slowing small-scale solar development.

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website.
Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.
“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” Widmar said.","NEW IBERIA, La. (KLFY) — First Solar, Inc. today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish.

The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor-based solar cells. These cells are connected into larger panels, which can be used in various applications from small devices like calculators to large-scale utility solar farms.

Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The facility, which officials claim has no dependencies on Chinese supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority, the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity.

Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish, according to First Solar CEO Mark Widmar.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Demand from U.S. data centers is expected to reach 606 TWh by 2030, a drastic increase from 147 TWh in 2023.
SEIA said that solar and storage are the fastest energy resources to deploy and the most capable of meeting the scale of electricity demand growth.
Developing a utility-scale solar project typically takes just 1.4 years, and batteries 1.7 years, significantly faster than other energy technologies, it said.
SEIA emphasizes that swift federal action is necessary to ensure the U.S. can power the AI innovations of tomorrow.","The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), representing over 1,200 companies and 280,000 workers in the U.S. solar and storage industry, has formally submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Request for Information (RFI) regarding rapidly expanding grid capacity.

SEIA argues that while the U.S. must sustain its AI dominance, achieving this requires affordable, reliable energy, a goal currently stymied by “onerous and unstable permitting policies and insufficient transmission capacity.”

Soaring demand, failing infrastructure

After decades of flat power demand, the grid is seeing significant increases in load growth, primarily from data centers and AI infrastructure. Demand from U.S. data centers is expected to reach 606 TWh by 2030, a drastic increase from 147 TWh in 2023.

The existing grid is ill-equipped for this surge, said SEIA. Over 70% of transmission and distribution assets are past the midpoint of their 50-year life expectancy. Furthermore, the rate of new transmission construction has dramatically dropped from an average of 1,700 miles per year in the early 2010s to just 350 miles between 2020 and 2023.

These issues, coupled with supply chain constraints for crucial equipment like transformers, with lead times of up to 144 weeks, are contributing to shrinking reserve margins and potential electricity supply shortfalls warned by grid operators like PJM and MISO.

SEIA said that solar and storage are the fastest energy resources to deploy and the most capable of meeting the scale of electricity demand growth. Developing a utility-scale solar project typically takes just 1.4 years, and batteries 1.7 years, significantly faster than other energy technologies, it said.

This rapid deployment is supported by a robust domestic supply chain; domestic solar module production tripled in 2024, and U.S. factories can now produce enough finished solar modules to meet nearly all domestic demand. Over $47 billion in manufacturing investments have been committed across 41 states, said the report.

However, the current permitting regime is creating significant risk. SEIA analysis finds that the completion of over 71 GW of solar and 42 GW of storage capacity, representing 74% of all capacity under development scheduled for 2026 to 2030, is at risk due to recent permitting policies. SEIA claims the current “moratorium” on permitting is accelerating a resource adequacy problem.

Call to action for the DOE

To mitigate these risks, SEIA is urging the DOE to utilize existing programs to encourage transmission investment, such as the Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP) and the Loan Programs Office (LPO). The association also recommends the DOE coordinate with federal and state agencies to standardize load forecasting and expedite permits for late-stage projects near new loads.

Natural gas cannot fill the gap, as these projects face their own delays, cost volatility, and supply chain issues, said the report. SEIA emphasizes that swift federal action is necessary to ensure the U.S. can power the AI innovations of tomorrow.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-356036-1200x789.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:33.201409

Facility forecast to raise Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4% in first full year of operations at capacity

Largest American solar manufacturer expects almost 18 GW of domestic production capacity in 2027

TEMPE, AZ. – First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year. Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“First Solar’s investment in Iberia Parish represents the kind of forward-looking growth that reinforces Louisiana’s leadership in energy and advanced manufacturing,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By pairing innovation with our state’s long-standing energy expertise and world-class workforce, this project creates lasting opportunities for Louisiana and bolsters American energy security.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said. “We are grateful for First Solar’s commitment and investment in our community, and we are proud to welcome their contribution to our growing energy portfolio. We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

“First Solar’s inauguration marks an incredible milestone for Iberia Parish and the entire Acadiana region,” One Acadiana President & CEO Troy Wayman said. “We’re proud to celebrate alongside both our state and local partners at Louisiana Economic Development and Iberia Industrial Development Foundation as we see this investment come to life — bringing quality jobs, new economic activity, and continued momentum for our manufacturing and energy sectors.”

The Trump administration is bankrolling the restart of two shuttered nuclear plants in hopes of reviving the industry. Those endeavors are moving along — but without federal funding, plans to build new large nuclear reactors haven’t made much progress yet.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office announced that it had both offered — and finalized — a $1 billion loan to help Constellation Energy restart Unit 1 at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

While Three Mile Island may make you think of nuclear disaster due to the partial meltdown of the plant’s Unit 2 back in 1979, that part of the facility has been dormant ever since. Unit 1, meanwhile, operated for decades without any major incident before it was shut down in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation said in July 2024 that the unit remained in ​“pretty good shape” and was ​“technically feasible” to restart.

Just a few months later, Constellation got its chance to do so. Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation to buy power from Unit 1, with hopes of getting the newly renamed Crane Clean Energy Center operating again by 2028. At the time, Constellation said it would likely spend $1.6 billion on the restart. This new federal loan will put a big dent in that cost.

The Loan Programs Office is also supporting the restart of Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Plant, which shuttered in 2022. The $1.5 billion loan was initiated under the Biden administration, and President Donald Trump’s DOE has continued paying it out this year. The plant received its first delivery of fuel in October and aims to start generating power before the year ends.

While large nuclear restarts are rolling along, new construction doesn’t have much progress to show. Construction of the last major nuclear project in the U.S. — Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle — went billions of dollars over budget and took years longer than expected. It’s become a cautionary tale for risk-averse utilities, who have yet to answer Trump’s call for a nuclear buildout, E&E News reports.

Still, the Trump administration is trying to will that nuclear renaissance into existence: This week it reaffirmed its commitment to an $80 billion plan to finance the construction of up to 10 new large nuclear reactors, first announced in late October.

It’s an ambitious goal that could create the nuclear expansion the Trump administration says it wants. But it still faces a big barrier: the administration itself. Trump officials have spent the last year undermining trust in federal financing by reneging on billions of dollars in grants, loans, and even permits for clean-energy projects. Those moves could make it difficult to convince companies to commit to expensive, years-long construction projects that will surely span administrations.

Ohio county takes on renewables ban

Ohio is a hot spot for local renewable-energy bans, but one county may pave the way for change.

A state law allows Ohio counties to bar significant solar and wind development in all or some of their townships. More than three dozen counties have done so, and Richland County is among them, with commissioners moving this summer to ban projects in 11 of its 18 townships.

Richland County residents started pushing back almost immediately, Canary Media’s Kathiann M. Kowalski reports. Gathering more than 3,300 valid signatures, they’ve ensured a referendum on the ban will be on the ballot this May, allowing every voter to weigh in on the future of clean energy in their backyard.

As COP30 closes, final deal remains unsettled

The United Nations’ COP30 conference comes to a close today, but participating nations still haven’t reached a final agreement to scale up their climate commitments. On Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the eventual deal must be ​“concrete on funding and adaptation, credible on emission cuts, and bankable on finance.”

As they do at every COP, nations disagreed over how far to take the conference-ending agreement. Climate-adaptation funding became a top issue, as countries on the front lines of climate change pushed to triple an annual adaptation fund $120 billion. More than 80 countries also called for the COP30 deal to include a road map for transitioning off coal, oil, and natural gas, scaling up 2023’s nonbinding agreement that nations begin moving away from fossil fuels.

,EPA,2025-11-21 19:08:31+00:00,JD Supra,EPA Proposes Major Changes to TSCA § 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule | JD Supra,Not Available,,,,,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/epa-proposes-major-changes-to-tsca-8-a-8443397/,"This rule is the direct result of a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2020, which required EPA to require reporting by PFAS manufacturers.
Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule.
Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard.
The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule.
In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months.","On October 11, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a final rule pursuant to section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) imposing a one-time reporting obligation on entities that manufactured (including imported) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at any time between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022, to the extent the information is “known or reasonably ascertainable.” “Manufacture” is defined to mean manufacture (including import) “for a commercial purpose.” Information required to be reported includes company and plant site information, chemical-specific information, categories of use, manufactured amounts, by-product reporting, environmental and health effects, worker exposure data, and disposal data; reporting is required on a chemical-specific basis and for each “site” where the chemical is manufactured/imported. This rule is the direct result of a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2020, which required EPA to require reporting by PFAS manufacturers. EPA therefore did not have flexibility with respect to whether to finalize the rule; they did, however, have discretion with respect to the scope of the rule, including whether to apply exemptions found in other TSCA contexts (for example, exemptions for article importers, the manufacture of by-products and impurities, and manufacture for research and development (R&D) purposes). Despite overwhelming public comment regarding the need for such exemptions, EPA declined to apply any of these exemptions in the 2023 final rule.

Application to “Chemical Substances”; Exclusion of FDA-Regulated Substances – The PFAS reporting rule applies to “chemical substances,” which is defined by TSCA § 3 to exclude “any food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device (as such terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device.” As a general matter, the rule’s direct impact on companies working under FDA oversight, including those in the drug, biologics, food, medical device, and cosmetics sectors, may be relatively limited. Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule. For example, applicability of the exemption is less clear when PFAS are produced (or PFAS/PFAS-containing articles are imported) for multiple end uses.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard. Data reported under the rule (unless covered by a valid and timely confidential business information (CBI) claim) will be publicly available and available to competitors, advocacy groups, and plaintiffs’ attorneys.

The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window

EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule. Specifically, in a November 13, 2025 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA announced that it is proposing to exempt the following “manufacture” from the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activity under the rule:

Import of PFAS in articles

PFAS in mixtures or articles below 0.1% (a “de minimis” exemption)

Manufacture of PFAS as by-products, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates and

Manufacture (including import) of PFAS in small quantities for R&D purposes (specifically, in such “quantities of a chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured, imported, or processed solely for research and development that are not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes”)

EPA has also proposed changing the reporting window. Currently, the reporting window is currently set to open April 13, 2026; most reporting entities have 6 months to report, except that small manufacturers that are required to report only because of their import of PFAS-containing articles have a full year. In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months. (Because, under the proposal, article importers would not be required to report, there would be no need for a longer reporting window for small manufacturer article importers.)

Next Steps and Looking Ahead

EPA will accept comments on the proposal through December 29, 2025. Companies should evaluate potential obligations under the existing rule and whether the proposed revisions align with operational and strategic priorities; consider submitting comments to individually or through industry associations to ensure relevant stakeholder perspectives are reflected in the administrative record.

The TSCA PFAS reporting rulemaking highlights the breadth of federal PFAS oversight, as well as the growing intersection between EPA’s PFAS-focused initiatives and the FDA’s ongoing oversight of chemicals and materials used in food and medical products. Parallel monitoring of both agencies’ regulatory initiatives is essential to effectively manage compliance, supply chain transparency, and associated liability considerations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 15:02:06.313819

This major investment, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, will enable the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to replace aging coaches with new hybrid diesel-electric motor coaches – strengthening the City’s transit network and improving air quality for communities across San Francisco.

“Thanks to Democrats’ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, San Francisco continues to modernize our transportation system while combating the climate crisis,” Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said. “This funding will help replace aging coaches with cleaner, more reliable buses—delivering safer commutes, reducing pollution and increasing economic opportunities for working families across the Bay Area. Our progress stands as a reminder of what a productive Democratic Congress can deliver.""

“I am thrilled San Francisco earned federal funding to help modernize its essential public transit system, which clocked over 150 million passenger trips last year,” said Congressman Kevin Mullin. “Public transit is the backbone of our economy and people across America rely on it to get to work, school and home. Democrats led passage of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because we know that when we invest in cleaner, more efficient transportation, we protect public health, mitigate environmental impacts, and create a more enjoyable experience for riders.”

“Modern, reliable buses are essential to keeping San Francisco moving. This federal investment strengthens our ability to provide excellent service today while accelerating the agency’s efforts to avoid costly breakdowns and loss of service,"" said SFMTA Director of Transportation Julie Kirschbaum. ""We thank the Department of Transportation for supporting reliable public transit, especially at a time when our financial outlook is unpredictable.”

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency will receive $39,800,000 for new hybrid diesel-electric motor coaches that will replace a portion of its aging fleet. These improvements will help reduce maintenance costs, increase system reliability and enhance service across San Francisco and northern San Mateo County while supporting California's long-term climate goals.

Following a letter of support for the project from Speaker Emerita Pelosi to Federal Transit Administration Executive Director Matthew Welbes, this award was granted through a competitive national selection process under the Low-or-No-Emission Program and the Bus and Bus Facilities Program – both created and expanded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.",http://pelosi.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pelosi.house.gov/files/featured_image/Speaker%20Emerita%20Full%20Screen.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 16:01:36.792637

The recording and slides of this presentation will be sent to everyone who's registered, for this event after the event concludes, so you will have access to those. If you have any questions, please feel free to drop them in the Q and A window, and we'll do our best to address all of them over the course of the presentation today. With that, we'll start introductions. I can quickly introduce myself. My name is Amy Yoon. I am part of Crux's Stock Capital Markets investor coverage team here at Crux. So I've actually met many of you already who registered for the webinar. And I'm very excited to share what we've been able to observe in the market for the first half of the year what we anticipate for the remainder of twenty twenty five and beyond. I will now hand it over to Katie Bays and Charlotte Caldwell, our marketing and business team for their introductions. Great. Charlotte, why don't you go first and then I'll jump in and start the presentation. Sounds good. Hi, everyone. I'm Charlotte Caldwell. I'm an analyst on the market intelligence team with Katie. I started at Crux about six months ago and very excited to hopefully share some helpful takeaways from our market intelligence report. Great. And I'm Katie Bays. I lead Crux's market intelligence practice, and I've been with the company since twenty twenty three. Let's get into the data. So I wanted to start with kind of a snapshot of where Crux's data comes from. This is such a common question that we get from lenders and from everybody. What is our data representative of? Crux has been surveying the tax credit market and the tax equity markets over the course of the last two and a half years. We have a database that sits at currently forty billion dollars of completed tax credit transactions, and it covers essentially every major tax credit category, more than a dozen different technology types. And this is where so much of our data is rooted. We, of course, we do have a marketplace on Crux. We have done more than one hundred and twenty transactions since our company began to operate, but the data that we have from our own activity is heavily supplemented by the data that we get from market participants such as yourselves. So we do consider the database to be relatively market representative. And for folks who have come to utilize and rely on this data, hopefully, you have found it to be so and that it's been helpful to your process. Let's get into our mid year market intelligence report and some of the core takeaways from that. You'll find a quick outline of our discussion topics on the screen here. We're going to start by touching on policy. Policy has, of course, been extremely dynamic in twenty twenty five and continues to be. We'll talk through the latest state of play with respect to key policy issues. We'll share some takeaways from the tax credit market in the first half of twenty twenty five and some of the key drivers of growth that we've observed in that market. Then we'll talk through pricing. Pricing is one of the most significant commercial terms in a tax credit transaction. It's one of the factors that we watch really closely, and so we will share general pricing dynamics, trends, and rules that we've observed. I'll then hand it back to Charlotte to talk about the tax credit insurance market. She's recently published a paper unpacking the nature of tax credit insurance at present, and we'll cover some of the core findings from that research. Then finally, we'll talk a little bit about what we've seen in the second half of this year so far and take questions at the end. With that, I want to encourage everybody to use, if you have questions, use WSIA's Q and A feature. There's a question mark inside of a talking bubble, and so you can submit questions there. As we receive them, we will certainly answer them, try to leave some time at the end to make sure that we can do that. Without further ado, let's jump into the policy. I think just as a table setting comment, as everyone is largely aware, this summer, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed Congress. It enacted a variety of changes. Maybe just as important were the things that the bill did not change. So while the bill did restrict the use of tax credits for wind and solar facilities that either begin construction after July fourth of next year or enter service after twenty twenty seven. It retained tax credits for most other technologies, and importantly transferability was retained for all different varieties of tax credits to which it had previously applied. Then there was one small tax credit category which was actually added to the transferability category. So generally speaking, even though there are these new restrictions placed wind and solar, the industry was largely, I think, untouched in the short term by some of the policy changes that were enacted in the context of the tax bill. There were some important changes to how the tax credits will be accessible in the future related to the foreign entity of concern rules, and we'll talk about that in greater depth. Importantly, we get to keep a lot of the familiar aspects of the core ITC and PTC tax code, the safe harbor function, the use of start construction to establish the right to safe harbor credits. In many ways, the tax regime has continued to exist largely similar format after the one big beautiful bill. But let's talk about kind of the core difference that I think a lot of folks in the market are processing, which is Fiat. So foreign entity of concern, set of rules that had previously applied to electric vehicles, which have been expanded now to apply to a variety of other tax credits, significantly the Section 48EITC and the Section 45Y PTC, as well as Section 45X advanced manufacturing PTCs amongst others, but those kind of being the most significantly affected. The implementation of the FIOQ rules really begins next year. There are different pillars of FIOC, which we'll talk through, but the implementation dates for those different pillars are non uniform. There are some considerations around when which provisions begin to kick in. We'll talk through that. Let's actually skip to the next slide and we can just kind of jump into it. So of the three pillars, the first pillar that we're going to discuss here is effective control. So the effective control provision intends to look at whether or not there are contracts that a company has entered, which are subject to fiat, which means that they're either entered after July fourth of twenty twenty five, or they have payments that persist after July fourth of twenty twenty five. Those contracts will be reviewed and evaluated from the point of view of whether or not those contracts confer effective control onto a prohibited foreign entity or a specified foreign entity. So that's the specified foreign entity could be a Chinese company owned by the Chinese government, but it could also be a Chinese individual, national company domiciled in China. So it's a bit more of a wide ranging definition. And the question here is in terms of which provisions effectively confer control onto those entities. Crux, Charlotte and I specifically have undertaken a process with a group of about five dozen manufacturers and companies that are building projects to evaluate their state of readiness with respect to implementing fiat. This is a core issue that companies are well down the path of trying to review their contracts and determine whether there are effective control clauses in there and then renegotiate those contracts to remove those clauses. But there's a lot of uncertainty. I think as folks will know, the Treasury has not issued any guidance related to the implementation of FIOQ yet, so which provisions in contracts and which contracts one must review is kind of an unknown question at this time, so that creates a certain amount of uncertainty and risk in the short term. Not a whole lot of time to figure this out. The phase in dates or the dates in which this provision applies are pretty much across the board, twenty twenty six for all parties. Even those projects that began construction in twenty twenty five or twenty four, it's more specifically twenty twenty five, projects that began construction this year but enter service next year will still be subject to the effective control provisions. Let's go to the next. Ownership is another critical test. There's two categories of ownership that the ownership rules look at: they look at the specified foreign entity, which is sort of a broad category, and then they also look at foreign influence entities or entities that are significantly owned by specified foreign entities. So, again, many companies have undertaken processes to try to evaluate whether or not their ownership flags against these ownership rules, but these rules as well kick in starting next year. So again, projects and tax credits that are generated within calendar year twenty twenty six, if they are among the categories that are listed on the screen here, the tech neutral ITC and PTC, 45X, Q, U, and Z, any of those tax credits will need to satisfy ownership rules in order to be qualified to generate tax credits. Let's go to the next. And then this is the supply chain. So material assistance is the third pillar of Fiat. I think this is actually one of the pillars that is best understood by folks in the market and and folks generally regard as one of the more, if not manageable or navigable, because all of Fiat is pretty complicated, at least one of the areas where you've got the clear sort of roadmap of what you are looking at. But in a general sense, companies need to satisfy that no more than a specified percentage of the costs incurred in the construction of that facility were incurred to certain foreign entities, specified foreign entities. The test here is a cost base. Companies have the option of using the domestic content safe harbor tables as a proxy for overall facility cost apportionment. And that that is, I think, as we understand, is generally what many companies are doing. The applicability of these rules is also a little bit delayed relative to the last two. Material assistance does not apply to facilities that began construction in twenty twenty five. It will apply to users of the 45Y, 48E tax credits that begin construction in twenty twenty six or later. It also applies to any 45X eligible tax credits that are generated beginning in twenty twenty six. There's a bit of a staggered implementation timeline for material assistance, but that broadly speaking is the three main pillars of FIOC. I know that we started our presentation with the most complicated thing, but I wanted to make sure we got this information out there. If folks have questions, feel free to ask them. Let's move on to the safe harbor quickly and then we can kind of dive into our market commentary. Wanted to just touch on again very quickly the safe harbor dates that have been somewhat updated in the aftermath of the one big beautiful bill. IRS's folks will be aware did release new safe harbor rules. Any facility that began construction prior to September second of this year can apply the legacy safe harbor regime. That means using the five percent cost test or the physical work test. Any facility that began construction September second or later has to comply with the new set of rules, which are substantially similar, but restrict the use of the five percent safe harbor to facilities that are smaller than one point five megawatts. We wanted to plot out kind of what the hypothetical combined beginning of construction, continuous construction, safe harbor windows accommodate, and it is essentially this that facilities have to begin construction, presuming they begin construction after that September second date, begin construction by July fourth of twenty twenty six, and then have to enter service essentially by either the end of December twenty twenty nine or the end of December two thousand thirty, subject to when they began construction to earn the tax credits that they have safe harbored into. There are caveats to that. The continuous construction test is not absolute. Companies can present that they've made continuous effort outside of that four year window of time, but the most straightforward application of the continuous construction test is the four year continuity safe harbor. That's what this figure is intended to represent. Then we'll go to the next slide very quickly, Charlotte. Just as a synthesis, this sort of outlines all of the rules related to the beginning of construction requirements. For anyone who needs that refresher, this slide is here. It's a bit of a desk reference, and as Amy said, we will distribute this material to everybody on the line as well. Let's go on to the next, Charlotte. I'll hand it over to you to run through some of our initial findings. Thanks, Katie. Okay. So the next section is kind of synthesizing, a bunch of different takeaways from the market, but the overall takeaway is that we saw significant growth in the first half of this year. So Crux's market data shows that the total value of tax credit sales exceeded twenty billion dollars in the first half of this year. So this this figure here in the light blue, you have first half of twenty twenty four, dark blue is first half of twenty twenty five. The first two columns are showing previous year vintages transacting in the current year. So that would be twenty twenty three vintages transacting in twenty twenty four. Twenty twenty four is transacting in twenty twenty five. And those have risen up to five point seven billion dollars in the first half of this year from two point five billion dollars last year, which is a significant growth. And then we also saw a significant growth in the current year category as well. So that's the next two columns. Those rose to twelve point three billion dollars from nine billion dollars And again, this growth is happening in spite of policy. So there was so much underlying momentum in the market that it was able to continue growing despite the policy uncertainty that characterized the first half of this year that Katie kind of covered in the last section. And, again, that's just due to a high number of historic investment decisions that have supported the continued growth in tax credit supply that we've seen over the past few years. And we also are seeing a bit of growth on the forward side as well. So that's the four columns on the right. So some buyers are taking positions on credits that will be generated in twenty twenty six and beyond, but you can see the overall volume is not nearly as high as the other two categories, and the increase year over year isn't as dramatic. And then this slide kind of zooms out a little bit. We have data from the Clean Investment Monitor showing total investment in energy and manufacturing, and that's stabilized at about thirty five billion dollars a quarter, which is elevated relative to the period before twenty twenty three. So as there's been lots of headwinds and public project cancellations in the market, this is just showing that there's still a large amount of capital deployment and strong market fundamentals. And one of the areas of growth that we've seen is in transfers out of tax equity structures specifically. So in general, for all tax equity commitments in twenty twenty five, we're estimating an increase to thirty two to thirty five billion dollars from twenty nine billion dollars last year. And, again, a big source of that growth is those transfers out of tax equity structures. So that's represented by the yellow on this figure, and we're expecting those to almost double from seven billion dollars to eleven to thirteen billion dollars this year. And then this figure here shows kind of a different cut of the same, you know, breaking down by financing structure across different technology types. And there's some interesting patterns that you can see. So utility scale solar has the highest access to TE at about seventy two percent. A lot of that is due to the track record of the developers that are developing these utility scale solar projects. And then smaller, more distributed technologies like CNI or community solar rely on TE much less often at only about twenty percent. And that's due to a combination of potentially some of these developers not having the same track record as utility scale, but also a lot of these projects are merchant or partially merchant. And typically, TE investors prefer fully contracted projects. So this is showing that for certain tech types, tax equity is limited, but transferability has introduced these creative capital solutions that are allowing these companies that historically couldn't access tax equity to utilize the benefits of working with an investor to achieve a step up and monetize their tax credits more efficiently. So in other words, the reason the financing structure matters is because structures that involve bringing on an investor allow an ITC entity to achieve a step up, whereas in a direct transfer, they're calculating that, off of the cost segregation report. So they're just able to monetize their tax credits more efficiently and calculate their step up based off fair market value rather than the cost seg report. And then another takeaway that we have seen is that storage and solar plus storage grew rapidly in in the beginning of this year. So they went from a combined nine percent in the beginning of twenty twenty four to twenty six percent of the market share in the beginning of twenty twenty five. And there's a couple of different factors that are playing into that. So we've seen technology improvements and cost improvements for batteries, which just makes it easier to incorporate them into facilities. But we've also seen increased demand for reliable and dispatchable energy, especially from data centers. On the flip side, we saw tax credits from wind facilities decline pretty substantially. So those went from thirty three percent to nine point five percent. And that's just exemplifying that the benefits of the market aren't seen equally across different participants, whether that be different technology types or investment grade sellers versus non investment grade sellers, which we'll talk about in a second when when Katie goes over pricing. And then finally, we're just seeing that the market is diversifying. So not only did we see storage and solar plus storage increase, but nuclear and advanced manufacturing are also up year over year. So those went from, combined less than twenty percent of the market to more than fifty percent of the market. And that's just one of the things that we we do expect this to continue and continue to see more diversified technology types enter the market. Right. And with that, I will pass it to Katie to cover pricing. Great. Thank you, Charlotte. All right. The broad takeaway here is that we have historically observed relatively strong pricing in the tax credit market. Let's go to the next slide. The trajectory in general for twenty twenty five has been sort of a downward trajectory on price. It's not a uniform experience across the market. One of the things that we've endeavored to do in this, the portion of the analysis here is to really bifurcate between the investment grade and non investment grade sponsors. Just to spend a second talking about who that is. Investment grade sponsor in our definition is really anybody who can convey an investment grade indemnity, and so that'll typically be a utility company, but it will also include situations where we know, there's a tax equity partner who is conveying a bank level indemnity along with a credit, even though the underlying sponsor in that deal is not themselves. Investment grade, those guys are generally observing and experiencing a slightly different market than everybody else. What we have on the screen here is a sort of very broad strokes average pricing for investment tax credits based upon those two designations. Historically, we've seen ITC's transact at ninety two point five cents. That's been a pretty persistent annual average between twenty twenty three, twenty twenty four. But then getting into twenty twenty five, what we found was that the market really bifurcated. There's always been a moderate premium for an IG seller, maybe a penny, but that percentage of that premium has really blown out to more like a three cent increase over the non IGE seller. So for our investment grade group, we generally saw pricing in the neighborhood of around ninety four cents, very strong. As far as ITC pricing goes, That would be sort of the, I would say the seventy fifth percentile of the market, sort of the top end of the ITC pricing. Then we have our of our everybody else, the non investment grade category. And for those sponsors, we actually observed a pretty significant decrease in pricing, around ninety one cents on average across all deal sizes, technology. So just again, at the ITC category as a whole. The divergence on the PTC side was observable, but not as significant. So we'll get into that a little bit more here in a sec. But this is, I think, generally, I think important table setting context in terms of what kinds of pricing we've observed in twenty twenty five. And just to get into the why, there are a couple of factors. One is obviously the policy uncertainty that hung over the market in the first half. There was a lot of back and forth between tax credit buyers and sellers over the indemnity package, the nature of the indemnity, particularly in the context of changes in law, retroactive changes in law. The sellers that could essentially respond to that uncertainty by providing an investment grade indemnity that, you know, the buyer will be made whole if there is a retroactive change in law, which fortunately there was not, but it was certainly a worry for parts of twenty twenty five. Think those folks experienced a more liquid dynamic market. People that could not offer that or had to kind of adjudicate that issue in the context of tax credit insurance, I think generally saw less liquidity. And so As we've gone into twenty twenty five or the second half of the year, we'll talk about this more, this dynamic has continued to hold and maybe become even a little bit more exaggerated. Let's go to the next. It's a very busy slide. I know it's probably harder to read on the screen, but for folks who will receive the deck, can go back and reference. This is very detailed data. What we have here is the distribution of average prices across the three major solar type categories based upon deal size. There's a couple of things here to note. One is that we do generally observe a positive correlation between deal size and price. Larger deals achieve certain economies of scale, generally transact at higher prices for buyers who want to transact in that, you know, several hundred million to, you know, maybe a billion dollar tax credit category, the quantum of savings that they can achieve, even at relatively high, you know, ninety four, ninety six level pricing is still pretty large. So the juice is well worth the squeeze. Smaller deals have a variety of other impediments. So when you get to the other end of the market deals under ten million dollars Charlotte will unpack that in greater detail in the context of insurance, but that's where you tend to see the lowest pricing in the market. That deal size relationship continues to hold as we have historically observed. The other things that we noticed are, of course, we have historically utility scale solar deals tended to transact at higher prices, investment grade utility scale sponsors got particularly high prices and price was very convergent. Really across all deal sizes, you're generally seeing pretty consistent pricing between say like ninety three and ninety six cents. For those non IG sponsors, pricing's a little bit lower, but still relatively high in the context of all of the other solar categories. We get into distributed solar. That's where we've actually seen some year over year movement in terms of where pricing kind of has softened and where it hasn't. C and I solar last year was the lowest priced segment of the solar market. We did not see that this year. We actually saw that resi solar dropped below C and I on average pricing for most categories. So we generally have seen, you know, relatively low pricing across all the distributed categories, but that resi was the lowest, followed by C and I being then a little bit higher. A lot of variation across deal sizes for both of those types, but we, you know, again, kind of have seen that those two categories price below utility scale and generally transact with a little less liquidity. Let's go to the next. So one of our other kind of major tech types, the wind production tax credits, this really forms a good example of the higher priced part of the market. Wind PTCs are generally pretty liquid, transact in a pretty liquid market. As Charlotte noted, we've seen a bit of a decline in terms of the overall market concentration of wind PTCs. We're seeing more of them transact on a long term strip basis, not on a spot basis. The general kind of trajectory of pricing is what you see on the screen here. There is a bit of a gulf between the non investment grade and investment grade win PTC sellers, but I think this is representative of really a category of the market where you do have a lot of investment grade participants, and the non IG group is a little bit thinner. We don't actually have as much data for that group here. Let's go to the next. Then the advanced manufacturing PTCs, just to kind of go to the other side of the market, we've got these two really established categories, solar and wind, and then we've got the sort of new category, which is the advanced manufacturing section 45X PTC. Wanted to show what we're seeing in terms of average pricing there as well. 45X PTCs have transacted at pretty high prices. We've seen some recent weakness in that, so in the third and the fourth quarter of this year, I would say the average prices declined somewhat relative to what you see on the screen, But as a general matter, we do tend to see 45X transact at relatively high prices. Charlotte will cover, I think, little bit more on what the prevalence of insurance is for this group. But we do see, we'll typically not see insurance very frequently on most PTC deals. We do see insurance on 45X deals more often. I think with that, maybe we want to take a moment and answer a couple of questions. Amy, I do see a few. Yeah, thank you, Katie. It looks like we've shared a lot of data across technologies and even how 45X compares to some of the mature solar tax credits. Is there any data that we can share on the pricing gap for perhaps 45Q or 45V in comparison to solar tax credits? Yeah. So I think that what we are seeing, we haven't seen a ton of 45Y. We have seen a couple of deals, but it's not been a super abundant part of the market. I would say that what we typically see is in terms of the newer 45Q is not new, but in terms of some of the newer PTC technologies, it is not uncommon that you will see pricing in the 80s, let's say maybe the higher 80s for a lot of those tax credits. Then what we have seen, I think 45Q, it's been just a little bit higher, probably closer to ninety or ninety two cents gross. Although I should say all the prices that we are sharing are gross prices paid by the buyer. There are transaction costs, are typically paid by the seller that reduce net pricing to the seller, but that would, I think generally be where we have seen those credits transact. They're not at the level of like a wind PTC or even 45X, but they are relatively strong pricing. There's good indication of market demand, I would say for all of the fuels production tax credits, particularly 45Q, very in demand, 45Z, the new clean fuels PTC has also been very in demand. There are unique insurance considerations for both, but there is a market for both of those credits and pricing I think has generally been relatively strong, if not at the level of a wind PTC. Does that make sense? Yeah, super helpful. As we cover pricing data, I think the next part of the data looks at how market participants are really allocating risk through insurance. For those of you who want to learn more, we actually just published our first insurance white pig bearer, which has been reviewed by all major insurance companies. And this is downloadable on our website, cruxclimate dot com, for further details. So with that, I'll hand it over to Charlotte, who will be covering our data on insurance. Awesome. Thanks, Amy. Okay. So in general, from, like, the widest view, there wasn't a huge change year over year in the percent of ITCs and PTCs obtaining insurance. So sixty to seventy percent of ITC deals have insurance, where twenty two to twenty three percent of PTCs have insurance. And again, ITCs have more inherent risks. So that's why they're just insured at a higher percentage, a high percent of the time. But in general, it's a very dynamic market that is tightening. So we've seen a lot of the input costs into insurance increase. So minimum fees are rising. Underwriting fees are rising. Those have gone from fifty to ninety thousand dollars to closer to a hundred thousand dollars or more. And then we've also heard that portfolios are often even more expensive because they can be seen as more complicated to underwrite and insure. And as Amy mentioned, we we get into a decent amount more detail on that in our insurance guide, so definitely take a look at that if you're interested. And we have heard that the higher cost of insurance is at least partially driven by some claims that have been made against transferable tax credit policies issued in the last couple of years. So, again, just lending to that tightening market. And so this slide is looking at the premium that we're seeing either for investment grade sellers or sellers that obtain insurance. So there are two different types of indemnities that we see in deals, either the seller's investment grade or they're obtaining insurance. In other words, companies transacting with without insurance are investment grade. If you are an investment grade and you're getting insurance, you're and sorry. If you are an investment grade, you're getting insurance and or you're transacting at a lower price. So the premium is pretty similar for these two. You can see it's right at about three cents, but that's not to say that your baseline price will be the same for, if you're an investment grade seller or if you're obtaining insurance. So on average, you'll transact at a higher price, about three cents, but it's not necessarily going to be the same price as an investment grade seller would see. So in short, insurance is worth it. You're still being compensated. There is a benefit, a quantitative benefit for this, but there's also a qualitative benefit as well. You're gonna see increased liquidity. There's just not a whole lot of risk appetite on the buyer side, so they're really looking for ways to kind of shift that risk and indemnify these deals. And the next few slides, I'll go through relatively quickly, but they're just kind of showing the percentage of insurance coverage across deal size, and then we'll also look at tech tech type quickly as well. So Katie mentioned earlier, typically smaller deals are not not as likely to be insured. So about twenty percent of deals under ten million dollars obtain insurance in our dataset. Usually, insurance is just too expensive as a share of the overall deal. And then that percentage jumped significantly in the ten to twenty million dollar deal size range. It declines a little bit after that. Just a lot of those larger deals tend to be more likely to be coming from investment grade sellers. But in general, insurance is most common in deals from ten to a hundred and fifty million dollars. And then for tech type, I think looking at solar specifically does a good job of kind of highlighting some of the trends. So looking at utility scale solar, about twenty five percent of these deals have insurance, and that's almost a one to one breakdown of the non investment grade sellers versus the investment grade sellers. So that's just reiterating my earlier point that if you're investment grade, you're not obtaining insurance. If you're non investment grade, you're much more likely to obtain insurance. And then on the flip side, we see resi solar is insured over ninety percent of the time. Most I think virtually all of the listings in our dataset were coming from non investment grade sellers. So the ratio is kinda flipped there, and we're seeing most of these deals obtain insurance. And it's also interesting to look at this as a time series. So this is showing advanced manufacturing, the percentage of deals obtaining insurance over time. So you can see that's fallen from eighty percent and somewhat stabilized around forty percent. And that's just showing that buyers are becoming more comfortable with this tax credit and requiring insurance less less than they were historically. And then here we have some data on the coverage levels. So coverage typically ranges from a hundred to a hundred and forty percent of the nominal value of the credits to account for all of the losses. Solar, with the exception of resi solar, so that first dot there showing the average coverage in blue and then the range, that is one of the more standardized, averaging just slightly over one hundred percent. Whereas residential solar, can see as a much wider range. And that's because of the portfolio approach here. Partial insurance is more common just because there's not gonna be one weather related event that would take out the entire portfolio. So not as necessary to have a high insurance coverage. And then we see a a pretty wide range as well for storage, and that's because of the kind of different deal structures that we see there that can vary significantly between fully merchant all the way up to fully contracted. And then finally, biogas averaged the highest at about a hundred and thirty five percent, and that's just reflecting the risk appetite of buyers for these tax credits. Great. Thanks, Charlotte. It seems like our data indicates that that's the case, but we've had lenders who indicated that insurance costs rose up to two fifty bps recently, which is significantly affecting their deal economics. Would you say that there are still material benefits to getting insurance then? Yes. I think you're still seeing an average three cent higher bid. It's pretty clear in the data that it is still worth it. And there's just not the buyer appetite for non investment grade uninsured deals. So that's still driving the need for sellers to obtain insurance. Okay. And then secondly, I know we've talked about Fiat and some regulatory changes that we experienced this year. Is change in law or Fiat going to be part of this growing list of exclusions or, you know, is insurance taking on Fiat risk? As of right now, we're not seeing insurers take on fee up risk. I think after there's more guidance, we may see that start to be more of the case. But yeah, we haven't seen that materialize yet. Great. Now let's talk about outlook. We just published our third quarter report and we'll be sharing our twenty twenty five annual report on February twenty fourth of next year. But let's talk about the outlook and how these trends combined with policy shifts are shaping market conditions for the rest of the year and beyond. Katie? Yeah, sounds good. All right, well, we'll get into kind of our first big takeaway here is that, you know, a lot of energy and time was spent, I think, following the one big beautiful bill from the point of view of, you know, what was it going to mean for tax credits? I think in the near term, the biggest impact on the market is actually really related to what does it mean for tax credit buyers? What we've observed is that a lot of corporate taxpayers There was a huge amount of change that the bill enacted to corporate tax liabilities and how corporations are going to calculate their tax capacity. We have about three hundred active buyers on Crux. We sought data from our buyer segment on whether or not they anticipated changes to their overall tax liability from the one big beautiful bill. About seventy three percent of them said that they did, and then about sixty percent of them said that that would in turn influence the amount of tax credits that they intended to buy. Those significant parts of the market. Our presumption is that corporate tax receipts for twenty twenty five will be down between twenty and thirty percent. All of that to say the tax appetite of the most important tax credit buyer segment has significantly been reduced by some of the tax law change. If we go to the next slide, that has really in turn influenced the volume of activity and deal activity in the market. We have historically observed that as the year goes on, total market volume and the amount of deal activity that is conducted on a quarterly basis that generally rises over the course of the year with the first quarter being the slowest, the fourth quarter being the busiest. That really is not what we're seeing at present. It was not what we saw in the third quarter. There was significant softness in the market in the third quarter with a lot of buyers really, you know, whether or not they will have tax capacity for twenty twenty five, really being engaged in just trying to figure out what the tax law changes mean for them. It's not so much that buyers have all had their tax liabilities wiped out. It's more that the changes in the tax law are really complicated and it takes time for buyers to work their way through that. I think one of the things we are now hearing from buyers is that maybe they did have reduction from bonus depreciation, R and E expensing, things like that, but they are triggering the corporate alternative minimum tax so that their tax liability is being basically adjusted up by the CIMT, which presents another opportunity for those buyers to kind of come back to the tax credit market. So there's a lot of kind of push and pull factors here. The taxpayer is working their way through that, and we would expect to see in the fourth quarter a pretty significant increase in total market volume. The other kind of important caveat here if you're a lender, right, is kind of time is pretty fluid if you're the taxpayer, if you're the buyer in this market. There is no hard and fast timing pressure as to why you have to transact in calendar year twenty twenty five. Buyers that want to take the credit for the tax credits on their quarterly estimated payments certainly do have some incentive to do so then to transact earlier, but that you have to kind of recognize that that benefit exists within the context of a lot of broader uncertainty around what that tax liability is likely to be at the end of the day, right? So There's a push and a pull. We do expect to see a significant amount of volume transact of twenty twenty five tax credits transacting in calendar year twenty twenty six. I think Charlotte shared a few minutes ago that we saw just under six billion dollars of twenty twenty four vintage tax credits transacting this year. It should be a pretty active, sizable part of the market next year as well. For folks that have different kinds of lending arrangements with projects that contemplate particular milestone payments or the sale of tax credits as a particular consideration, just kind of understanding that the market right now, I think, feels a lack of urgency to transact eventually as buyers retain additional confidence in what their tax appetite is, we would expect to see that dynamism return. We are beginning to see it now, just acknowledging though that there's something like seven weeks before the end of the year, so not a whole lot of time. Let's go to our last slide here. The last slide is a forecast. We get this question pretty often, which is basically how much did the One Big Beautiful Bill reduce the overall tax capacity of the market, or how much tax credit generation is going to be affected by changes in the law. The blue line on this chart shows what our forecast was before passage of the O triple B, we essentially would have forecast that the market would continue to grow in total size up to about twenty twenty seven, kind of peaking at about sixty eight billion dollars of tax credits generated, and then declining gently thereafter. When we take out the wind and solar facilities that would no longer be eligible after twenty twenty seven, and particularly into the later parts of this decade, what we see is, of course, a reduction, but we wanted to kind of model a couple scenarios. One is that, we are sort of seeing the incentive to bolster or to upsize the storage component of a facility. We're seeing that incentive is more heavily weighted now because those storage components are retaining access to tax credits, so your ability to recover investments in shared infrastructure, for instance, between a solar and storage facility, might make that an attractive thing to increase as a share of the overall facility mix. What we try to do is model a couple scenarios, one where you just take out your solar and wind projects that are not eligible, sort of first order effect. The other scenario where we sort of increase the share of deployment of the marginally eligible or the facilities that retain eligibility. What we see in both scenarios is that the market does shrink a little bit relative to our pre OB3 case, but not by a huge amount. We generally project a relatively flat year over year market, kind of in the low to mid fifty billion dollar a year level, going through the end of the decade, kind of settling right around fifty billion or forty eight billion in those two scenarios. So that it's generally a pretty positive story. I think the fact that, you know, before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, you're looking at a market for roughly twenty billion dollars a year of total tax credit generation. We're really seeing something that's in excess of two times that through the end of the decade. It's a relatively strong market even in spite of those changes. With that, Amy, let me hand it back to you. We can take any of the last questions that we've gotten here. Yeah, sounds great. Thank you, Katie. We have a couple of questions, actually mostly on fiat as we anticipated. Katie, the first question is, what kinds of clean energy projects are viewed most risky with regards to fiat and tech credit eligibility? The second question also regarding fiat is, are there any important diligence points or deliverables for lenders to ensure the projects that they lend to don't inadvertently trigger a fiat risk, given what you shared on effective control? Yeah, so let's start with the first. I think the conventional wisdom right now is that, the US reshoring of supply chains for wind are most mature. The supply chain, if you're developing a wind facility, is typically a de minimis level of China exposure in that, It's kind of the safest aspect of the complex. Secondarily, I think we've seen a huge amount of solar manufacturing that's been reshorred such that at this point, I think the majority of solar projects are also in relatively good shape. The principal risk really in Fiat kind of centers around the battery storage side of the industry. There are a couple of major manufacturers of battery cells and components, particularly BID and cattle that are also big suppliers into the US. Accounting for, that's not an immediate problem. It doesn't necessarily mean that a facility cannot qualify for Fiat, but it does require you to be really careful about that material assistance cost ratio calculation to make sure that the components of the facility that were sourced from a Chinese supplier are not in excess of the thresholds that are articulated by that part of the rule. Those are a couple of, I think, points that are good rules of thumb right now. I think if you speak to a lot of developers, and again, we do have some data on Fiat compliance that we'll be sharing broadly on December eighth is our intended publication date for that information. What you'll generally see is actually that folks, I think, seem to have pretty sound concrete plans as to how they're planning to comply with PHYOC. Probably the biggest question, the biggest area of uncertainty is actually more on the 45X side. That's an area of the market where you do have some entities with Chinese ownership. They've generally, I think, sought to dissolve that Chinese ownership or liquidate that aspect of their ownership so that they don't have that problem going into twenty twenty six. Some facilities may not achieve that quite by December thirty first of this year, but generally speaking, 45X, I think, is the canary in the mind shaft in terms of which parts of the tax credit ecosystem have the most to work through and sort of the least amount of time to do it. Then remind me the other question I think was related to insurance or? Diligence. Diligence. Okay. In the absence of guidance, I should just say, we do expect some regulatory guidance from Treasury within the next couple of weeks. It won't be dispositive, it won't be comprehensive, but it will provide some perhaps initial insight into where IRS intends to go with the FIAC implementation. We're looking for more fulsome guidance from IRS probably in the first quarter of next year, but those milestones will settle, I think, some of the outstanding questions around diligence. Right now, we are seeing is folks are sort of taking a more is more approach. You're looking at supplier certifications. You're counting on your suppliers to make attestations and to source certifications from their suppliers, to put together a comprehensive diligence package. In a practical sense, what we are really seeing for lenders, and especially for tax equity investors, is a near term focus on legacy Section forty eight and Section forty five tax credits. What you're trying to do is you're trying to approach parts of the market where that fiat risk is extremely limited. Fiat does not apply to legacy forty eight and forty five tax credits, so those get a clear kind of advantage in the diligence process. Then the other piece that we're seeing is situations where US based ownership is obvious, the supply chain is really clear, and you can just sort of practically satisfy yourself that the fiat risk is not gonna be thrown over on the project. Those are the kinds of situations that I think people are approaching first and then we're waiting for greater standardization on what are the necessary diligence items after guidance has been released. Thank you, Katie. I think we actually have one more question. The question is, why is it so hard to invest in resi or C and I solar projects? I can answer this. I'd say at a high level, it's challenging relative to TLR scale solar portfolios from a diligence and funding perspective. So when you're comparing a one hundred megawatt utility scale portfolio with two fifty megawatt each versus a one hundred megawatt resi or C and I with five to ten megawatt each within that portfolio, the diligence undertaken is exactly the same. So it becomes extremely cumbersome to undertake that exercise from a diligence perspective. In resi, I would say also a series of bankruptcies we had in the space with SunPower, Sunnova also affected generally investor sentiment overall. And also some lenders in the resi space historically have really struggled with getting individuals as the off taker and don't view an aggregated portfolio with individuals with FICO scores as positively, just relative to an investment grade utility as an off taker, for example. I think from a funding perspective as well, there are specific funding conditions in the credit agreement. So if you'd have to get an IE certificate or a Norse de Borrowing or Lien Waivers for each of these projects to fund, again, it becomes a very cumbersome process. That said, despite the market noise at Crux, we've been continuing to support resi and C and I solar developers finance their projects at various stages. And we've been able to observe lender appetite continue to exist in this space. Of course, it really comes down to very quality sponsors with quality projects. And of course, investors and lenders being very, very selective to finding investment opportunities in the space. But I would say those are probably some of the kind of key risks that we've been able to observe, in the resi and C and I market, recently.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e46c9ca980cf228bbbbf55/6920c8e2c2fc8e847976489a_Manufacturing%2004.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:28.209332

Joliet, Illinois – An $87 million loan will help transition the city’s drinking water supply from a stressed and unsustainable aquifer.
Prospective borrowers can apply for and receive WIFIA loans at nearly any stage of project completion.","On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the availability of $6.5 billion in Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) funding for water systems, with an additional $550 million available to states. The agency also announced the approval of five WIFIA new loans.

On the available funding, EPA said interested entities can apply through WIFIA’s rolling application process.

The first WIFIA Notice of Funding Availability was issued during President Donald Trump’s first term. This funding represents the 9th round of financing with $6.5 billion available. Through a separate Notice of Funding Availability, $550 million is available to state infrastructure financing authorities through the SWIFIA program. EPA is currently accepting letters of interest for both.

For this new round of funding, EPA said it identified the following as priority areas that will advance it’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, including:

Ensuring safe drinking water and addressing pollution in our nation’s waterbodies;

Unleashing American energy dominance;

Advancing cooperative federalism by supporting local, regional, and state water priorities;

Supporting innovation in the water sector; and

Promoting economic growth and furthering America’s industrial resurgence.

“EPA’s WIFIA program provides a win-win for communities and American taxpayers,” said EPA’s Assistant Administrator for Water Jessica Kramer. “Communities use these competitive loans to upgrade water infrastructure to benefit residents and businesses while loan payments reimburse the U.S. Treasury.”

New Loans Approved

EPA also announced the following loans have been approved and said it will work with the recipients to formally close loan agreements.

Fort Worth, Texas – A $347 million loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes.

Pflugerville, Texas – A $176 million WIFIA loan will support multiple projects modernizing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in this growing city. Work will include design and construction of a new wastewater treatment plant, expansion and consolidation of wastewater collection systems, and water main rehabilitation. This is the second WIFIA loan to the City of Pflugerville.

Joliet, Illinois – An $87 million loan will help transition the city’s drinking water supply from a stressed and unsustainable aquifer. Projects will include upgrading the distribution system to reduce water loss as the city prepares to begin using water from Lake Michigan. This is the third WIFIA loan for the City of Joliet under an agreement that will provide a total of $395 million in financing.

Ashland, Oregon – A $73 million WIFIA loan will help build a new drinking water treatment plant to provide a safer and more resilient supply of clean drinking water to this small, rural community.

Wilton Manors, Florida – A $28 million WIFIA loan will reduce the risk of pipeline failures, minimize water loss, and improve system reliability, particularly during emergencies such as storm events. Projects include replacing water mains, rehabilitating and replacing wastewater lift stations and force mains, and improving stormwater drainage systems.

About WIFIA

Established in 2014, the WIFIA program is an EPA-operated bank that provides supplemental, flexible, low-cost credit assistance to public and private borrowers for all types of drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects. WIFIA offers long-term loans that can be combined with State Revolving Fund assistance, municipal bonds, and federal and state grants. They can help communities deliver more critical water infrastructure projects for a lower cost with less impact on rate payers.

Like a bank, the WIFIA program has funding available on an ongoing basis. This allows prospective borrowers to request financing on their schedule. Prospective borrowers can apply for and receive WIFIA loans at nearly any stage of project completion.

However, the Department of Energy has unilaterally reneged on congressionally mandated spending by cutting federal funds from hundreds of projects. In May, DOE announced the cancellation of 24 awards for clean energy demonstrations – including carbon capture and industrial demonstrations – totaling more than $3.7 billion in awards. Then, in early October, DOE announced the termination of 321 awards for energy projects worth approximately $7.56 billion in obligations, largely impacting states and congressional districts represented by Democrats. Subsequently, it was reported that an even larger DOE cut list – with about 300 additional projects, including many in states and districts represented by Republicans – was circulating on Capitol Hill and among advocates.

Locally, these cuts will have devastating impacts on communities and private sector businesses, eliminating jobs and economic opportunities.

They would also impact nearly every state across the U.S. Each project represents local jobs and economic development, partnerships, upstream and downstream supply chains with their own private investments, and up to 50% non-federal cost share from project partners.

The high cost of retreat: What happens when federal commitment to energy innovation falters

Congress has provided strong bipartisan authorizations and appropriations for federal funding programs that advance energy innovation, designating the Department of Energy (DOE) with a key role to support technology advancement from research and development to demonstration and commercialization. The Energy Policy Act of 2020, Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS Act), and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) all received bipartisan support and set in place grants and loans to bridge the financing gap that private lenders and companies alone cannot support. This type of federal support is vital to bring more energy solutions to market, boost U.S. competitiveness, and maintain global energy leadership.

In May and early October, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced it was canceling billions of dollars in awards to hundreds of projects funded by this bipartisan legislation, particularly BIL, and recent reporting indicates additional project cuts are likely underway. Cutting these project awards not only violates Congress’ clear direction to DOE to fund energy innovation across a variety of technologies; it undercuts the administration’s stated goal of energy dominance, negatively impacting American businesses and both national and local economies.

DOE’s role and partnership is critical to bridging the financing gap to build domestic energy security and reliability and compete in global markets. Many emerging energy infrastructure technologies face bankability challenges that prevent private investment and stunt technology development. To overcome these challenges, government investment has and will be essential to get these technologies to market.

Withdrawing this federal funding would not only undermine our global leadership in energy, but also negatively impact communities and drive uncertainty across multiple industries of national importance. The effects of withdrawing federal funding – from job loss, local economic development impacts, cascading effects up and down supply chains, and a long-term erosion of trust in bipartisan federal financial incentives – risks the viability of future investments directed by the federal government and threatens local economic prosperity.

DOE announced cuts and additional cuts being considered

DOE issued its Secretarial Policy on Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance in May 2025. This policy establishes the following criteria for reviewing projects: 1) financially sound and economically viable, 2) aligned with national and economic security interests, and 3) consistent with federal law and this administration’s policies and priorities and program goals and priorities. These criteria run counter to the bipartisan legislation directing DOE to bridge the funding gap for innovative energy technologies as these technologies are not yet economically viable for commercial lenders and require DOE support to advance to commercialization. The criteria also run counter to how federal funding is established and executed: Congress passes legislation to direct the policies and funding, which federal agencies must carry out.

DOE proposes to terminate federal investment cost-share in over 650 projects totaling over $23 billion

DOE is now considering pulling billions of congressionally-directed investment from research and development (R&D) to large-scale demonstrations necessary to move technologies toward commercialization. These awarded investments span a variety of cutting-edge energy technologies – including carbon capture and storage, nuclear energy, next-generation geothermal, grid and transmission infrastructure, and natural gas technologies – that support stated administration priorities like reducing electricity costs, onshoring manufacturing, and industrial innovation.

Project awardees potentially impacted include hundreds of U.S.-based companies, organizations, and state and local governments across the country – including auto giants General Motors, Volvo, and Harley Davidson, as well as major oil and gas companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil. Also at risk are projects among the $5+ trillion in new investments touted this year by the White House. For example, GE Vernova announced plans to invest $600 million in U.S. manufacturing over the next two years, creating more than 1,500 new jobs. This includes a $50+ million project to expand gas turbine manufacturing in Schenectady, NY – a project DOE would be walking away from. DOE would also be rescinding federal cost-share from other private sector partners making massive investments in the U.S., including TS Conductor Corporation, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Diageo, FirstEnergy Corp., Westinghouse, General Motors, and Kraft Heinz.

A number of these cost-share investments date back to the first Trump administration and have benefited from years of bipartisan support as they’ve progressed from research and development to pilot and demonstration. DOE would be rescinding its share of investment in a number of first-of-a-kind pilot and demonstration projects before they get the real bang for their buck, which comes from shepherding technology advancements to commercialization and enabling private sector deployment. That is the return on investment that Congress directed and that American taxpayers benefit from. Millions, if not billions, of previous federal investments that supported these projects in earlier R&D project stages could be wasted if DOE walks away from project partners that are finally at the demonstration stage.

This move, along with its lack of transparency, risks the integrity of DOE’s longstanding project development pipeline.

The impacts of announced cuts and additional cuts being considered

Announced cuts and additional cuts being considered would impact nearly every state across the U.S. Each project represents local jobs and economic development, partnerships, upstream and downstream supply chains with their own private investments, and up to 50% non-federal cost share from project partners. Altogether, the economic impact is far greater than the amount of stated federal investment to be canceled.

The most-impacted states2 by federal investments (combining announced cuts and additional cuts being considered) include:

California — $3.6 billion

Texas — $1.6 billion

Illinois —$1.1 billion

Indiana — $854 million

Michigan —$846 million

Louisiana — $705 million

Colorado — $653 million

Georgia — $624 million

North Carolina — $591 million

Minnesota — $555 million

From projects to cut emissions from the industrial and transportation sectors to projects that would reduce methane emissions and air pollution, the impacts of DOE cuts touch a wide range of projects that propel American innovation and competitiveness.

Industrial Innovation

U.S. manufacturing, including heavy industrial sectors, is essential for economic security – and innovation in these sectors is critical to enabling future growth of U.S. manufacturing on a global scale.

U.S. manufacturing directly employs more than 12.8 million workers3 and for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, there is an approximate 264% return in cumulative impact to the overall U.S. economy.4 Industrial sectors like the U.S. chemical manufacturing and petroleum refining sectors contribute ~8%5 of U.S. GDP and are exposed to global trade dynamics, making up 9% of U.S. exports.6 Goods with lower carbon intensities are best positioned to win future market share for manufacturers with an export-oriented market, as many foreign markets develop mechanisms to explicitly account for carbon intensity of imported goods.7

Innovative industrial demonstration projects supported by the federal government are a foundation for future private sector investment, as follow-on projects will be less risky and costly for the private sector. Demonstration projects are essential for validating innovative technologies’ operational and commercial viability at scale. Large complex infrastructure projects, such as carbon capture projects, typically require two to six commercial-scale demonstrations of the technology to prove their effectiveness and reduce cost through a process known as “learning by doing.”8 Industrial demonstration projects drive innovations in production processes, heat delivery, alternative fuels and feedstocks including hydrogen, carbon management, and product recycling. These innovations will lead to reductions in capital and operating costs. They will also increase U.S. industrial technology export competitiveness, leading to cutting edge technologies being licensed abroad bringing benefits to U.S. companies.

U.S. companies want to innovate and reduce their emissions in partnership with DOE, as exemplified by the overwhelming interest in DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which was 10 times oversubscribed. Through the IDP, DOE received over 400 concept papers from U.S. companies requesting over $60B in federal funding matched with ~$100B in private cost share. The application and negotiations process resulted in 33 first-of-a-kind projects across 20+ states with $6B in federal funding, matched by $14B in private cost share.9

The announced and additional considered cuts to the IDP include 21 projects with ~$3.5B of obligated federal cost share across multiple sectors and technologies. These indiscriminate cancellations undermine the intent of the IDP to increase manufacturing competitiveness, increase U.S. industrial technology export competitiveness, achieve emissions reduction in industrial sectors, and build shared prosperity for American workers and communities through job creation and local partnerships. The cuts to the Mitchell Cement Plant Decarbonization Project are an especially detrimental example of the lapse of federal-private relationships, as the DOE has been working closely with the Indiana facility.10 The latest award was the fourth related to this project, which has a history of DOE funding since at least 2022.11 U.S. cement plants will have trouble meeting net-zero without CCS due to their process emissions, and the Mitchell project was a prime example of one facility leading the charge. Other proposed project cancellations, such as Dow’s $95M award to capture by-product CO2 from their ethylene oxide operations in Freeport, Texas to produce electrolyte solvents was aimed to strengthen the domestic battery supply chain and reduce reliance on China.12 Canceling these projects hurts America’s ability to compete on a global scale.

Additional industrial-focused DOE-funded projects outside of the IDP were also impacted by the recent funding cuts. These include projects from the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) like the testing of a novel carbon capture technology on blast furnace gas at U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thompson Works in Pennsylvania, a facility that the federal government has a vested interest in through its “Golden Share.”13

Businesses also require a level of certainty throughout the entire project development process, from project conception to final investment decision, construction, and startup. Because DOE is now canceling previously awarded projects, the private sector may be less willing to participate in future federal partnership opportunities to achieve any administration’s goals, given a perception of increased political risk.

Carbon Management

U.S. investment in CCS and DAC commercial pilots and demonstrations is essential for maintaining national competitiveness in export markets as global demand for low-carbon products grows. Other countries, including China, Canada, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and members of the European Union, are making major investments in DAC, CCS, and carbon utilization to secure advantages in low-carbon trade. Limited federal investment can help bring new CCUS applications to market by reducing risk for first-of-a-kind projects that would not otherwise advance. Public-private partnerships for commercial pilots and demonstrations are therefore critical for building investor confidence and creating market conditions where follow-on projects can attract private capital without federal support. Recent bipartisan funding decisions have placed the United States on a path to lead in these technologies and in related economic and workforce development. Reducing these investments now would unnecessarily jeopardize that progress.

In recent years, federally funded research and investment have helped launch a new wave of carbon management pilots and demonstrations in key industrial sectors, including refining, chemicals, steam methane reforming, steel, and cement. These projects can accelerate the wider deployment of commercial CCS, particularly in export-oriented states such as Louisiana and Texas and drive new investment and job creation. To date, more than 270 publicly announced carbon management projects across the country represent more than $77.5 billion in capital expenditure. For these commercial investments to succeed and continue generating economic benefits, including from demand for low-emission industrial products abroad, the United States should prioritize the funding already committed to major pilot and demonstration projects.

Federal investment in CarbonSAFE projects derisks carbon management for private sector investment by performing the complex and costly work of characterizing storage reservoirs, analyzing core and seismic data, and preparing Class VI applications. Because carbon capture and storage operate as a three-part value chain consisting of capture, transport, and storage, the sector faces a chicken-and-egg problem in which none of these links can function without the others. Building out storage capacity first is the key step that allows the rest of the system to scale. DOE’s announced cuts and additional cuts being considered to several CarbonSAFE and storage-focused grant awards weakens the foundation for large-scale carbon management in the United States. Most of the affected projects were in regions that are essential for deployment, including in Louisiana, where four projects were cut, the Southeast, where an additional four projects were canceled, and the Illinois Basin.

The latest project cuts could set back innovation across several novel and emerging industries that the United States has pioneered, such as DAC. Carbon removal is a growing global industry; without federal support, project developers will deploy first-of-a-kind projects in other countries. In fact, U.S.-based startup Carbon Capture Inc. has already decided to relocate the company’s first commercial DAC pilot project from Arizona to Canada due to better incentives and a more stable regulatory environment. The project is expected to go online by the end of October, and at full capacity, it will be Canada’s biggest operating system of its kind.

One of the funding cuts is for a DAC hub powered by next-generation geothermal energy. Next-generation geothermal is an exciting new technology with enormous potential to meet growing U.S. energy demand, including for DAC. Canceling this project would hamper the rollout of DAC as well as the rollout of next-generation geothermal. According to the Carbon Business Council, rolling back U.S. investment in DAC Hubs puts 130,000+ jobs at risk, billions lost, and idle factories, while other countries seize the industry leadership opportunity.

Despite the administration’s stated priorities on coal and natural gas, these rollbacks include promised investments in carbon capture technology that would improve local air quality during the operation of coal and natural gas resources. Funding cuts include coal-sector demonstrations, FEED studies, pilots, and a planned CO2 trunkline, wiping out U.S. innovation testbeds for integrated capture, transport, and storage on coal flue gas. These include the large-scale pilot and integrated FEED at Wyoming’s Dry Fork Station, a FEED study at the Four Corners Generation plant in Navajo Nation, funding for Wyoming’s Integrated Test Center, a test-bed for carbon capture innovation, the Edwardsport IGCC FEED in Indiana, and regional CO2 trunkline planning Trail of the Chiefs, which would have connected multiple emitters in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming to geologic storage sites. The additional cuts being considered also include DOE funding for Project Tundra, a major retrofit at the Milton R. Young station. The Wyoming funding cut is notable because the state legislature has also maintained its coal carbon‑capture mandate, enacted in 2020 as HB0200.

Cutting these U.S. demonstrations and pilots may push capture developers to validate equipment abroad, like at the test center in Mongstad Norway, rather than at U.S. facilities with American workers and operating under U.S. conditions.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a necessary input for many essential industrial processes, including crude oil refining, clean steel manufacturing, and fertilizer production. It also has important applications as a feedstock and/or fuel in aviation and marine shipping. Catalyzing the hydrogen industry promotes domestic energy security, independence, and reliability via an all-of-the-above approach to energy production and development. Federal funding incentivizes domestic hydrogen production, innovation, and delivery from a variety of sources, including nuclear energy, renewable power, and natural gas with carbon capture. Promoting hydrogen production maintains the U.S. as a global market leader, especially while other countries are increasingly seeking new energy sources. Moreover, the U.S. can lean on existing infrastructure like pipelines that are already built out in the Gulf Coast. The U.S. is on its way to a self-sufficient hydrogen industry which will strengthen the economy and create good-paying jobs, but more investment is needed to continue to spur innovation.

The announced cuts and additional considered cuts destabilize the burgeoning hydrogen economy. The proposed cuts include eliminating all of the awards by the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program as well as 76 other hydrogen projects that support the buildout of a domestic hydrogen industry. These projects represent over $821 million of obligated federal funding for: hydrogen production pathway research and scaling; fuel cell technology innovation; hydrogen storage, transport, and infrastructure; hydrogen vehicles and mobility applications; and industrial hydrogen use and decarbonization. The DOE cuts threaten to stall the momentum needed to build a competitive, self-sustaining domestic hydrogen industry. These projects are critical to advancing technology readiness, commercialization, and workforce development across the entire hydrogen value chain. Their funding cuts would significantly undercut progress in decreasing costs, accelerating market deployment, and building a skilled workforce – precisely what is needed to attract private capital and build market confidence. Sectors such as steel, refining, chemicals, and heavy-duty transportation stand to be most affected: without continued public investment, these hard-to-abate sectors lose near-term decarbonization opportunities made possible using hydrogen.

A full cancellation of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program would rescind almost $7B of federal funding from innovative clean energy projects, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of private investment nationwide. The hubs program was a bipartisan initiative passed in a bipartisan law; cutting the support now would be antithetical to the administration’s stated goals to bolster domestic energy production and American competitiveness and would undermine the development of the domestic hydrogen industry. The U.S. will risk its leadership position on the global stage, both in terms of exporting a variety of transportation fuels that rely on hydrogen as a feedstock and ceding leadership in technological development as other countries continue to fund and make progress on a variety of hydrogen production pathways and end uses.

Methane Pollution Reduction

The oil and gas sector is the largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions in the U.S. Federal financial and technical assistance for methane pollution reduction prevents loss of valuable energy resources, decreases human and ecosystem exposure to harmful pollutants, strengthens industry competitiveness in the global market, and creates good jobs.

Announced and additional considered cuts include awards to projects that were selected as part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP). Through MERP, Congress authorized DOE and EPA to leverage their joint expertise in advancing methane mitigation technologies by providing financial and technical assistance to help oil and natural gas operators implement cost-effective solutions to implement innovative methane emissions reduction technologies. These funded projects would have spurred innovation in the U.S. methane mitigation sector while creating jobs and reducing emissions of methane and other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants like benzene from the oil and gas sector. The projects would have also reduced emissions from oil and natural gas infrastructure in or near overburdened communities where people live, work, and go to school, creating clear air quality benefits for those communities and the industry alike.

Other methane-related projects that were cut pre-date MERP and were already partially funded. These are ongoing projects, and many are midway through data collection and analysis. These projects supported technology and inventory development to understand methane emission sources and mitigation opportunities while also creating jobs. The funding cuts threaten all these benefits, creating uncertainty for both the communities surrounding oil and gas development and the industry itself at a time when companies are asking for more certainty.

Near-Term Energy Infrastructure

DOE’s investments in solar, wind, and grid upgrades, and associated community engagement, community benefits, and workforce programs, are a key component to promoting affordability, resilience, and reduced pollution in the near term, and to spurring innovation that will pay future dividends. Announced cuts and additional cuts being considered in each of those areas will harm communities and the environment and reduce future American competitiveness.

Solar and Wind

Federal investment in solar energy has reduced energy costs for consumers and enhanced American economic competitiveness: as DOE itself notes, without DOE’s involvement, the average solar photovoltaic (PV) module production cost per watt would have been $5.27 in 2008 rather than $1.92. Solar’s affordability-in large part a product of targeted federal investment-contributes to the technology’s decade-long installation growth.

The next generation of solar innovation funding awards announced cuts and additional cuts being considered includes many instances of research, development, and deployment that would have continued to drive down the cost of solar energy and support domestic manufacturing, including awards of nearly $3 million to Silfab Solar Cells’ Washington production facility to scale a new high-performance silicon module technology; nearly $5 million to Silfab Solar Cells’ South Carolina production facility to demonstrate efficiencies in next-generation solar cells; and $6.4 million to Swift Solar to improve efficiencies in different climate zones. Funding for wind technology innovation was also hard-hit, with commensurate consequences for energy affordability, American manufacturing and economic competitiveness. Multiple million-dollar-plus investments in agrivoltaics-the dual use of solar generation and agriculture, which can provide an important revenue stream for farmers while reducing solar land use requirements-have also been cut or are reportedly at risk of being cut by DOE.

DOE’s announced cuts and additional considered cuts include funding to projects to improve community engagement, investigate community benefits mechanisms, and evaluate solar siting practices-all essential avenues to deploying energy infrastructure in communities across the country. These projects included $2.3 million awarded to the Solar & Storage Industries Institute to research community acceptance of large-scale solar projects, nearly $2 million awarded to Princeton University to reimagine community benefits mechanisms for large-scale solar projects with an eye toward promoting community-driven and equitable benefits, and nearly $2.5 million awarded to the University of Pennsylvania to gain insights into the drivers of community support or opposition. CATF’s research has found that community engagement, when done well, can build lasting relationships, reduce permitting timelines and litigation risk, and ensure that projects deliver real benefits to the people most affected by them. This research into how developers and communities work productively together to achieve positive outcomes is an essential component of energy deployment.

Grid Resiliency

A stronger, more resilient grid is a precursor for the next chapter of American economic growth. As new demand sources, including data centers for artificial intelligence, come online and new energy sources are deployed to meet that load growth, targeted federal investment can deliver high returns on investment. Deployment of grid modernization technologies, rebuilding and reconductoring lines to enhance capacity, and other direct grid infrastructure upgrades will improve reliability, maximize existing assets, and improve affordability while reducing the need to build greenfield infrastructure. These efforts can quickly and cost-effectively create additional grid capacity and interconnect new resources to locations served by existing infrastructure, particularly when more interconnection capacity will be needed to serve projected load increases in the near term. Deployment of grid modernization technologies, rebuilding and reconductoring lines to enhance capacity, and other direct grid infrastructure upgrades will improve reliability, maximize existing assets, and improve affordability while reducing the need to build greenfield infrastructure. These efforts can quickly and cost-effectively create additional grid capacity and interconnect new resources to locations served by existing infrastructure, particularly when more interconnection capacity will be needed to serve projected load increases in the near term.

DOE’s announced and additional considered cuts to grid related investments directly reduce efforts that would strengthen grid reliability, efficiency, and resiliency. For example, cuts include a $50 million grant to Minnesota Power to modernize its high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system to meet future energy needs while increasing the reliability and resilience of the regional grid. GDO’s cuts included investments in a number of programs that would develop advanced management for distributed energy resources (DERs) such as energy storage, solar systems, and chargers. These distributed and demand-side resources can be some of the most cost-effective and quickly deployed resources that provide both energy and capacity to maintain resource adequacy and other grid services. The benefits of DERs, aggregated into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), have been demonstrated in several studies, including the Department of Energy’s VPP Liftoff report, which estimates that 30-60 GW of VPP capacity operated on the grid in 2023. Additionally, according to a recent Brattle report, the cost-effective load flexibility potential in New York is estimated to reach 3 GW by 2030, or 11% of the New York power system’s summer peak.

Microgrids and energy resilience hubs can provide significant grid reliability and resilience benefits to communities whole, especially during periods of grid disruption from severe weather or disasters. The primary purpose of many of the DOE projects was to improve resilience to extreme weather events, including for rural and remote communities. Among the cuts was a $17.3 million grant to Jamestown, NY, for a microgrid system that would ensure energy is delivered to public services, the hospital, designated emergency shelters, schools, and other businesses. These projects are intended to decrease risk of blackouts and brownouts and contribute to grid stability. Microgrids can also be designed to strengthen grid reliability and resilience through smart grid technologies.

Grid Planning

Well-planned transmission that more broadly supports connecting low-cost generation resources with load centers can reduce rates and improve affordability, reduce grid congestion and improve system efficiency, and build connections between regions that allow electricity to be transmitted during emergencies. Unfortunately, our national grid today is disjointed with multiple regional operators and transmission planning that is solely conducted at state and regional levels. While states and regions are often eager to collaborate with each other and explore these opportunities, collective action problems and differences in governance between states and regions can hinder much-needed progress in connecting our grid. Federal investment can provide the resources necessary to support cooperation, planning, and coordination across regions to help overcome these challenges. Yet, funding to projects that support regional planning and deployment, such as the Minnesota Commerce Department/JTIQ project, are among those announced cuts and additional cuts being considered by DOE. Cancellation of awards to support collaborative grid projects not only hinders the development of lines identified proactively between regions but also disincentivizes further regional collaboration efforts. Cancellations like this only serve to maintain a grid unprepared to address the demands of the 21st century.

Transportation

DOE’s transportation-related programs are central to reducing air pollution and decarbonizing the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The recent $3 billion in funding cuts to innovative transportation projects would jeopardize progress across a broad portfolio of investments that accelerate zero-emission mobility, including producing low-carbon fuels, building EV charging and freight corridors, electrifying heavy-duty and public transit fleets, modernizing ports and airports, and training the skilled workforce needed to deploy these systems. In addition to bolstering domestic transportation infrastructure, these investments would underpin U.S. innovation capacity and industrial competitiveness in rapidly emerging global markets for clean transportation technologies and fuels. One of the funding projects being targeted would support a John Deere-led effort in Illinois to develop charging systems for zero-emission off-road equipment ($2 million); another would help Blue Bird retool an existing factory in Georgia to produce zero-emission school buses ($80 million); and another would support converting a GM vehicle assembly facility in Michigan for EV production ($500 million).

The list of considered cuts also includes the Orsted Star e-Methanol project ($99 million) in Texas and the M2X Energy low-carbon methanol project ($6 million) in North Dakota, both aimed at producing clean methanol for marine fuel to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate segments of global transport. These initiatives are critical for demonstrating scalable, low-carbon liquid fuel pathways that can displace fossil bunker fuel and strengthen U.S. leadership in the modernization and decarbonization of the maritime industry, a sector where international regulations and private shipping commitments are already driving rapid change. Defunding such projects would not only slow technological progress but also erode investor confidence and cede competitive ground to other nations investing heavily in low-carbon fuel innovation. By halting demonstration and deployment efforts just as they begin to scale, these cuts would delay near-term emissions reductions, weaken domestic supply chains that are poised to become globally competitive, and risk fragmenting regional planning efforts essential to long-term energy and economic security.

Conclusion

DOE’s role in energy innovation is necessary to bridge the financing gap for innovative energy technologies. Existing investments add to U.S. energy security and global competitiveness while adding billions of economic investment across the country, supporting local supply chains, jobs, and communities. These investments also represent bipartisan demand for the deployment of innovative energy technologies, which will support many American industries, including industrial manufacturing, power, and transportation.

Industries need certainty in federal investments if they are to expend the private costs necessary to bring more energy options to market. Canceling DOE’s financial commitments to these projects would inject more market uncertainty while going against congressional direction and the administration’s priorities to enhance energy reliability and security. DOE should maintain its existing commitments.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/21092116/EnergyTransmission_HeroFeature_1b.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:00.159121

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop. When combined with new EV battery manufacturing, such as the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C., the state remains in the top four nationally for investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries.

Making clean energy work post-IRA

Amittay said the Inflation Reduction Act and its associated tax credits drove much of the growth that year. “Plenty of this growth would have happened regardless of the policy landscape.”

“Renewable generation continues to be a notch above the economy statewide,” he said. “What’s really kind of head and shoulders above statewide growth is storage and grid.”

That includes folks such as Charlotte-based Heimdall Power’s president, Brita Formato, who presented about her new powerline “neuron” during an E2 event last week in Charlotte. The device provides real-time data to utilities about their transmission line capacity:

“Using the infrastructure that we already have will bridge us to that 7-10 years that we need to build out the grid,” Formato said. In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.

Looking ahead, Amittay said he expects growth to continue, albeit more slowly.

“What we’re doing is leaving some potential for jobs on the table,” said Amittay, referring to changes in federal policy during the last year. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminated or greatly restricted federal incentives for solar installations and manufacturing.

The initiative was developed in partnership with the International Sanitary Supply Association (ISSA), whose standards and expertise have shaped the program’s curriculum and training framework. Students completing the two-semester program will receive industry-recognized, ISSA-endorsed Basic Certified Cleaning Technician and Advanced Certified Cleaning Technician credentials, demonstrating their knowledge of cleaning standards, best practices, and protocols.

Nunez recently received a $54,000 donation from the Port of New Orleans (Port NOLA), HDR, Inc., Evans-Graves Engineers, Inc., and the Advocacy Partners to support the implementation of the program. The generous donation will help fund curriculum development, instructional materials, and facility enhancements that will allow the college to provide high-quality, industry-aligned training.

“The Environmental Services Technician program represents an important expansion of our workforce mission,” said Dr. Tina Tinney, Chancellor of Nunez Community College. “Through the generosity of Port NOLA, HDR, Evans-Graves, and the Advocacy Partners, as well as with the expertise of ISSA, this unique program offers a pathway not only to employment, but to purpose. It prepares our region’s students for impactful employment while driving economic prosperity and community well-being.”

Uplifting Underserved Students

Nationwide, the unemployment rate for individuals with a disability was twice that of those with no disability in 2024 (U.S. Department of Labor). In an effort to close that gap locally, the Environmental Services Technician program will serve as a bridge to opportunity for special education students in St. Bernard Parish Public Schools, providing hands-on experience and employable skills.

The first cohort of Environmental Services Technician students consists of dual-enrolled, special education students from Chalmette High School. Upon graduation, these students will be prepared to work in environmental services departments across healthcare, education, and commercial facilities.

In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.","A version of this article first appeared in WFAE’s Climate Newsletter. Sign up here to receive weekly climate news straight to your inbox.

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop. When combined with new EV battery manufacturing, such as the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C., the state remains in the top four nationally for investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries.

Making clean energy work post-IRA

Amittay said the Inflation Reduction Act and its associated tax credits drove much of the growth that year. “Plenty of this growth would have happened regardless of the policy landscape.”

“Renewable generation continues to be a notch above the economy statewide,” he said. “What’s really kind of head and shoulders above statewide growth is storage and grid.”

That includes folks such as Charlotte-based Heimdall Power’s president, Brita Formato, who presented about her new powerline “neuron” during an E2 event last week in Charlotte. The device provides real-time data to utilities about their transmission line capacity:

“Using the infrastructure that we already have will bridge us to that 7-10 years that we need to build out the grid,” Formato said. In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.

Looking ahead, Amittay said he expects growth to continue, albeit more slowly.

“What we’re doing is leaving some potential for jobs on the table,” said Amittay, referring to changes in federal policy during the last year. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminated or greatly restricted federal incentives for solar installations and manufacturing.

This new political landscape has made renewable energy businesses in particular more sensitive to state and local changes. During this past legislative session, lawmakers removed a key carbon pollution reduction target and took aim at a tax abatement for utility-scale solar projects. Meanwhile, other initiatives, such as Duke Energy’s PowerPair and Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, have helped buoy rooftop solar sales into the first quarter of 2026.

The battery maker has formulated a preliminary plan to restart its Jianxiawo mine by early December, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The company has asked suppliers and partners to ready equipment, chemicals and workers, they said, as well as notifying the refiners that draw feedstock from the mine.

CATL’s preparations aren’t a guarantee that the mine will get regulatory approval. The people said the company’s schedule could be subject to change, and that they’re still awaiting sign-off from the authorities.

CATL didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments. Calls to the natural resources departments of both Yichun city and Jiangxi province, where the mine is situated, went unanswered.

The fate of Jianxiawo, owned by the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, has fixated the industry in recent months. Production at the mine was suspended in August after CATL failed to get an extension on an expired permit.

The mine is expected to account for about 3% of global lithium production. The supply uncertainty, at a time of tighter government scrutiny of the sector, has fueled heightened volatility in prices of the battery metal. Earlier this month, CATL was told how much it should pay for the mining rights, a crucial step in the process that would allow Jianxiawo to restart.

The lithium industry has struggled with a global glut, exacerbated by slowing demand for EVs, although prices have been boosted in recent weeks as the market becomes more confident in demand prospects from the energy storage sector.

The most-active lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange has jumped over 10% this month, topping 100,000 yuan ($14,000) a ton earlier this week. Bullish sentiment intensified after Ganfeng Lithium Group Co.’s chairman predicted prices could reach as much as 200,000 yuan next year, if demand grows more than 30%.

New York, N.Y. - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump's leadership.

This progress includes announcing a proposed rule today that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of ""pressure testing"" Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

""We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,"" said EPA Administrator Zeldin.

The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, known as the San Pedro Port Complex, handle 40 percent of all container cargo entering the US and, according to the Los Angeles Times, are the single largest source of smog-forming pollution in Southern California, releasing more emissions than the region’s six million cars each day. Approved by SCAQMD on November 7, the framework includes substantial enforcement provisions, with penalties ranging from USD50,000 to USD200,000 per violation. Those funds will be directed toward projects benefiting communities near the ports. The agreement outlines a phased approach to achieving zero-emission operations, covering multiple equipment types by May 2027, with finalized plans for all categories to be in place by the end of 2029. These commitments build on the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP), a collaboration between the ports that since 2005 has guided them to reduce their emissions of diesel particulate matter by 90 percent, nitrogen oxides by 68 percent, and sulfur oxides by 98 percent.

North American manufacturers cut orders of raw materials amid weak supply chain conditions. Manufacturers in North America significantly reduced their purchases of raw materials and intermediate goods in October, according to the latest data from the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. The Index registered at -0.33 globally in October, showing that supply chain capacity is not being fully utilized. In North America, the Index fell to its lowest level since March: -0.45. This decline reportedly suggests a possible slowdown in production within North America, reflecting a global environment characterized by underutilized supply chains. Chinese factories are also reducing input buying, the Index reported, increasing spare capacity across Asia’s suppliers. Based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses worldwide, the Volatility Index tracks demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs. The next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index will be in December.

Navigating US congressional inquiries: Key considerations for non-US companies. United States congressional inquiries have become an important instrument to shape policy agendas, test industry practices, influence public opinion, and apply pressure on industries and companies seen as politically relevant. Non-US companies can face unexpected obstacles in these matters due to a number of factors, including cross-border considerations, conflicting laws, and cultural differences. Our alert looks at practical challenges non-US companies may face in congressional inquiries and provides strategic considerations.

US releases 2025 list of critical minerals, adding ten new ones. On October 7, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published the final 2025 List of Critical Minerals in the Federal Register, adding ten new minerals to expand the 2022 list to 60 commodities. The new entries are boron, copper, lead, metallurgical coal, phosphate, potash, rhenium, silicon, silver, and uranium. These minerals were added to address supply chain vulnerabilities for industries like electronics, steelmaking, agriculture, renewable energy, nuclear power, and national defense. Last year, the US imported 80 percent of the rare earth elements it used. The expansion of the list reflects a strategic effort to bolster domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign sources for minerals essential to national security and the economy. Designating critical minerals unlocks expedited federal permitting under FAST-41, Defense Production Act funding, tax incentives, and streamlined reviews, potentially accelerating projects. The Department of Interior can also provide expedited permitting procedures for critical mineral projects.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:54.573645

Like Musk’s award, Rivian’s plan hinges on a series of highly ambitious performance targets over the next decade, including lifting Rivian’s stock price to $140 (it currently trades around $15). In a softening EV market, and without the financial momentum or investor fervor that once buoyed Tesla, those targets appear particularly steep.

In an SEC filing, Rivian’s board said the package is designed to retain Scaringe as the company enters a “critical next phase” and prepares to launch production of its new electric SUV, the R2. The compensation plan doubles his annual base salary from $1 million to $2 million and gives him the right to buy up to 22 million shares across 11 tranches if Rivian’s stock hits specific price milestones. Scaringe can acquire an additional 14.5 million shares if Rivian meets profit and cash-flow targets before 2032. He can exercise his first tranche at $40 per share. Scaringe currently owns about 1 percent of Rivian. If the plan vests fully, he could add roughly 3 percent more.

Unlike Musk’s plan, Scaringe’s award does not require a shareholder vote, because it was issued under an already approved 2021 incentive program. Rivian’s board ultimately deemed the original performance goals as unrealistic, including a target that envisioned the stock hitting $295.

The Tesla story is hard to replicate

Much of Scaringe’s windfall hinges on the success of the new $45,000 R2 SUV and the smaller R3, which is expected to be priced in the mid-$30,000 range and has already generated significant consumer interest.

Rivian faces a very different landscape than Tesla did during its early ascent. Tesla benefited from low interest rates, abundant capital, and an early-adopter boom in EV enthusiasm. Musk also rode a wave of unique tailwinds—from meme-stock mania to rapid early profitability and a cult-like following—that helped him meet some of the lofty targets in his famously controversial 2018 pay package.

And a successful EV business is far from enough. Since reaching profitability in 2019, Tesla’s high stock price has been increasingly buoyed by optimism on its non-vehicle products, such as software and robotics.

Rivian’s non-EV prospect is less clear and appears to be reliant on external partnerships. Earlier this year, the company formed a joint venture with Volkswagen Group to develop a scalable “software-defined vehicle” architecture, with winter testing of a reference vehicle planned for early 2026.

Bringing data centers to support artificial intelligence online is a top priority for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s newest members, Chair Laura Swett and Commissioner David LaCerte, they said Thursday at their first open meeting since being confirmed.

“In addition to our core mission of keeping the lights on for all Americans at reasonable costs, my priority as chairman is to ensure that our country can connect and power data centers as quickly and as durably as possible,” Swett said.

LaCerte echoed that sentiment.

The AI data race requires “bold action” to protect the economy and national security, he said.

“The risks of inaction or delayed action are simply too great,” he added. “I look forward to partnering with all stakeholders … to accomplish these goals.”

FERC is beginning to consider a proposal from the U.S. Department of Energy for new rules governing the interconnection of data centers and other large loads to the transmission system. State utility regulators earlier this month raised a series of concerns about the proposed rulemaking, including their role in overseeing retail power sales and the potential for data centers to impose costs on other electric retail customers. DOE asked FERC to issue a final rule by April 30.

During FERC’s open meeting, LaCerte said action on data centers must be balanced with maintaining affordable electricity.

“I know that Americans are fearful of higher energy costs due to data center construction and the cost of additional transmission and infrastructure,” LaCerte said. “It’s our duty as commissioners to fully protect these people from undue costs.”

Furthermore, FERC must keep ratepayers in mind in all deliberations, according to LaCerte, who joined FERC from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

“There are many people in this room, [and] will be in this room during my tenure, looking to curry favor for one project or industry,” he said. “None of these people represent the ratepayer, but we do.”

Also, Lacerte said energy companies shouldn’t face “unnecessary obstacles” that hinder their efforts.

“[National Environmental Policy Act] reviews across the federal government have run off course, failed to protect the environment and often only serve to delay or derail infrastructure projects,” he said.

Swett, a former FERC staffer, said she aims to streamline FERC regulations to bolster energy infrastructure maintenance and construction.

“We are looking into cutting regulatory red tape and increasing transparency in our permitting processes, as well as other FERC processes, to incentivize investment,” she said.

During a media briefing, Swett said she values “legal durability” — the concept that regulations and agency decisions can survive scrutiny in the courts.

Also, Swett stood by FERC’s status as an independent agency.

“Everything that FERC does is independent,” Swett said.

The DOE Organization Act separated FERC from the department’s review powers, Swett said. Those limits, coupled with the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires FERC action to receive stakeholder and commissioner input, ensure the agency’s “independence is safeguarded structurally, and it will continue to be,” Swett said.

Here are four other takeaways from the open meeting.

Winter gas prices expected to jump 26%

FERC staff expect electricity use to be slightly lower this winter than last year, according to the agency’s annual winter outlook report. Peak demand, however, is expected to be 1.6% higher.

While this winter is expected to be warmer than last winter, average natural gas prices are set to rise 26% to $4.39/MMBtu from the previous winter, based on futures prices for the Henry Hub national benchmark on Nov. 4, staff said. Rising demand for natural gas, including from LNG export facilities, is contributing to higher prices at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, staff said. Natural gas fuels more than 40% of U.S. electricity, and gas prices help determine electricity prices.

The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. LNG exports will jump 18.7% to 16.3 Bcf/d on average this winter from a year ago, according to the report.

Meanwhile, drought conditions across the West are expected to cut hydroelectric power production this winter. Drought could also limit operations at power plants that use once-through cooling systems and reduce hydro output in central and southern U.S. regions, according to the report.

FERC considers ‘blanket’ LNG and hydro authorizations

FERC on Thursday launched inquiries to consider creating “blanket” authorizations for certain liquefied natural gas and hydroelectric projects. The commission currently allows pipeline operators to conduct certain activities without getting project-specific authorizations.

“We’re finding ways to simplify and optimize permitting to instill confidence in the promise of building for our future,” Swett said.

Earlier this year, FERC Commissioner Lindsay See pushed for LNG blanket authorizations.

“It’s the right time for us to be thinking through carefully how we can best do our job to ensure facility changes meet our statutory protections while moving forward with appropriate speed and administrative efficiency, especially as so many [LNG] facilities in our country are reaching operational stages,” See said at the open meeting.

The agency closes stagnant dockets

FERC closed four dockets involving “duty of candor” requirements; affiliate conduct standards for liquid pipelines; safe harbor policy on natural gas and electric price indices; and tariff waivers.

The long-dormant dockets have “shrouded the industry with ambiguity,” Swett said.

It’s important that FERC declutters its dockets, according to LaCerte.

“While these ideas and concepts may eventually return, they serve no good looming in purgatory for years on end,” he said.

FERC enforcement levels dip

The commission approved 11 enforcement office settlement agreements totaling $36.6 million in fiscal year 2025 compared with 12 approved agreements totaling $82 million in FY24, according to the agency’s annual enforcement report released Thursday.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eaTTWzJhyr7OT0iyNsNYh2_FyeCFKY5BdxHEE-dI720/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzI1Ny5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:10.863101

But the markup on “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, showed the process has a long way to go.

Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) made changes to the bill to secure more Democratic buy-in. But in the end, the 25-18 vote only included two Democrats.

Still, Westerman stressed the importance of his bill, which would tighten timelines for National Environmental Policy Act reviews and reduce the potential for litigation. He said a wide spectrum of projects stand to benefit.

“NEPA abuse is strangling critical public and private investments, infrastructure, defense, energy and mining at a moment when we can least afford it,” he said.

Ahead of the markup, the Arkansas Republican heard pleas from several Democrats who demanded the bill include bolder language that would — in effect — force the Trump administration to reverse orders stalling renewable energy projects on land and off the coast.

His updated text released earlier this week, which states NEPA is a “procedural statute” that does not mandate an environmental outcome, seeks to provide “certainty” that a federal agency may not “rescind, withdraw, amend, alter or otherwise render ineffective” any environmental document unless ordered by a court.

In addition, during the markup, the committee did pass one amendment that would prevent an administration from pulling a legitimate permit for a project of any kind — something the bill’s co-sponsor, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), said has happened “over multiple administrations.”

But that language did little to convince all but one other Democrat — Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.) — that the bill would address the clear, as one put it, “elephant in the room” — that is the Trump administration’s attacks on wind and solar.

“For us, we don’t just want a technology-neutral bill,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), who was in talks with Westerman. “We want a technology neutral outcome.”

Democrats emphasized the administration’s attempts to halt offshore wind projects, add red tape for renewable permits and cancel environmental review for the largest solar project in the country.

“It’s an insane war on the energy of the future and you all want to pretend it’s not happening,” said ranking member Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), suggesting Republicans were living in a fantasy.

And while Democrats asserted they were open to amending the 1969 environmental law, Huffman tried to beat down the “false narrative” that NEPA reviews have ballooned into “this monstrous thing.”

In fact, he said President Donald Trump’s White House East Wing construction project was a prime example of the importance of restraint.

“This is what happens when there’s no way to stop a dumb idea move through the NEPA process,” he said, displaying large photos of the site of the largely demolished wing.

He added, “We will help you fix this bill.”

Democrats’ failed amendments

Democrats tried to chip away at the legislation by offering a flurry of amendments that would strike or alter key pieces of the bill. All but Golden and Minnesota Republican Rep. Pete Stauber’s bipartisan permit certainty offering failed.

Huffman offered a total of six amendments, including one that sought to emphasize the importance of the purpose of NEPA. Others would have barred the legislation from taking effect until all clean energy projects and grants were reinstated.

Huffman also wanted to expand the scope of review to include long-term impacts, ensure increased transparency for draft documents and ax a provision limiting the scope of NEPA reviews.

Another Huffman amendment would set the statute of limitations for judicial review of agency decisions to two years; it’s currently six.

“That’s a pretty dramatic reduction,” he said.

While objecting, Stauber quipped that Huffman had “connections” to the Natural Resources Defense Council, prompting outrage from Huffman that derailed the markup for several minutes. They struck a agreement to resolve the dispute after a brief recess.

An amendment from Rep. Luz Rivas (D-Calif.) would have added renewable energy to the list of national policies for the Council on Environmental Quality to “foster and promote.”

Westerman shot back: “Renewable energy is already covered under the ‘SPEED Act,’” arguing the bill treats all forms of energy the same. “This is an amendment in search of a problem,” he said.

And Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) — who was just sworn in to replace her father, the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who chaired the committee for years — offered an amendment that would embed environmental justice to the list of CEQ’s national policies. Westerman objected that should not apply to a procedural statute.

Westerman wants to get the bill on the House floor by the end of the year. That could be a tall order given the shrinking timeline. But GOP leaders signaled their interest.

“Chairman Westerman’s permitting reform bill is a major priority of ours, and we’re going to be moving it on the floor as soon as it’s ready to go,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in an interview after the markup, adding, “Obviously, we’re backed up from the shutdown so we’ve been working through it. … We’re going to keep catching up, but we want to get that bill moving as fast as possible because it’s a really important reform that’s going to create a lot of jobs.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1d/30/85b0fc094b0284392c83a306eb96/u-s-congress-75300.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:38.755839

POLITICO interviewed current and recently departed CDC employees about the changed work environment.
Houry also noted that CDC employees who worked on a critical nutrition survey were not initially reinstated, as well as employees who worked on communications and policy.
“We know of people who have now received three RIF notices,” a third CDC employee said.
Kennedy and the CDC Other HHS subagencies, including FDA, NIH and CMS, have seen fewer rounds of firings than the CDC.","They’ve faced several rounds of firings and sporadic reinstatements, witnessed the dramatic ousting of their director and the resignation of top career leaders in protest. Some were shot at by a gunman targeting the agency’s Atlanta headquarters in August and all have watched as Kennedy fired and then replaced a key panel of CDC vaccine advisers.

In addition to all that, like most federal workers, many CDC employees went without paychecks during the longest-ever closure of the federal government.

On Wednesday, as some employees returned to buildings riddled with bullet holes, morale took another hit with a surprise update to the CDC’s vaccines and autism webpage. It suggests that vaccines may cause autism and states that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.” The move upended decades of work by senior career vaccine scientists to combat misinformation about a potential link between vaccines and autism – which many large studies have found no evidence of.

In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon described the change as a “common-sense update” to fulfill a “commitment to transparency and Gold Standard Science.”

He also said that Kennedy is trying to restore a “broken” CDC: “His focus is on returning the CDC to its core mission and ending the culture of insularity that has undermined public confidence.”

Some employees have a different take.

“On top of the never-ending feeling that we have metaphorical targets on our backs, a lot of employees feel like they have literal targets on their backs,” one CDC employee said. “The mood among CDC staff is ‘dead man walking.’”

The congressionally-mandated reinstatement of fired CDC workers marks at least the fourth time the administration has had to backtrack on planned firings of large chunks of the agency’s workforce.

POLITICO interviewed current and recently departed CDC employees about the changed work environment. Most of them were granted anonymity for fear of retribution.

Taken together, the eight workers described a culture of declining faith in the agency and a lack of guidance and communication from leadership. In his nearly three months on the job, CDC Acting Director Jim O’Neill has sent only one agency-wide email, two employees said, about how the agency should improve.

“Usually we have regular ‘all hands’ calls with the director. And the director takes time to meet the agency,” said a second CDC employee. “We’ve never heard the man even speak.”

Nixon said that O’Neill is having “almost daily meetings with CDC leadership” and has led the response to a recent infant formula recall.

In early October — just 10 days into the shutdown — the Trump administration laid off around 1,760 HHS employees, primarily hitting the CDC. It later reversed about half of those firings, citing “data discrepancies and processing errors.”

Democrats negotiated a provision in the continuing resolution that requires the CDC employees laid off during the shutdown and not initially reinstated — and the hundreds in the same situation at other agencies — be brought back. But CDC employees are skeptical that their reinstatements will stick.

“These people, especially those who received the reduction-in-force notices on Oct. 10, are wondering what happens Jan. 31,” the day after the continuing resolution expires, said Yolanda Jacobs, president of American Federation of Government Employees 2883 representing CDC workers in Atlanta.

“Are they going to be back [to] … being used as bargaining chips?,” Jacobs said. “When this administration makes threats, it does everything that it possibly can to make good on those threats.”

Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that promotes government service, said those concerns are not baseless.

“Come Jan. 31 — the CR ends Jan. 30 — all bets are off,” Stier said. He added that other protections governing the firing of federal workers still apply.

The laid-off CDC staff who were not initially reinstated include employees on the Institutional Review Board, which evaluates research studies, the Technology Transfer Office, which deals with patents, and the Employee Assistance Program, which provides counseling and emotional support for the agency’s staff, former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry said on a call with reporters in October. Houry also noted that CDC employees who worked on a critical nutrition survey were not initially reinstated, as well as employees who worked on communications and policy.

The shutdown-ending deal means those employees are now being reinstated.

The agency has seen three large scale layoffs, in February, April and October — making it one of the hardest hit agencies during the Trump administration. In the days or weeks following each round, some employees have been told their firings were a mistake and asked to return.

“We know of people who have now received three RIF notices,” a third CDC employee said.

An agency in chaos

Despite the volatility, Amy Kirby had assumed her team — which had been working on a project to centralize CDC disease surveillance data from across the agency — was safe.

Kirby has been part of the leadership for the One CDC Data Platform effort since 2024, and the Trump administration had indicated it was a priority. O’Neill’s lone email to CDC staff after he assumed the acting director role in August pointed to the 1CDP project as an example of innovation, Kirby told POLITICO.

Kirby was shocked to learn that, on Oct. 10, the majority of employees working on the project – around 16 people — had received reduction-in-force notices.

Unlike many CDC employees that HHS has said were mistakenly fired, the 1CDP staff did not have their reduction-in-force notices rescinded the following day. HHS and CDC told Kirby’s bosses that the firings had been a mistake, she said, but “it was never reversed. It only got reversed when Congress put it in the bill.”

“It’s very odd that in a month, they couldn’t reverse what they were saying was a mistake,” Kirby said.

She believes the firings were purposeful. “Even if you’re working on an agency priority, they will still fire you.”

Kirby herself never received a reduction-in-force notice. But she decided to quit after most of her team was fired.

Her team is now returning, but they “don’t feel safe,” she said. “They are working under the assumption that in February they’re going to get RIFed again.”

“It is heartbreaking,” Kirby said. “I’m sad for the people that are still there having to struggle through all of that. I’m sad for our country that we don’t have CDC at its best.”

A fourth employee said they have struggled to plan for the future without a clear picture of what it will look like — and who will be left.

“We simply can’t do the kind of transformative long-term thinking that is needed for this work (or this administration) to be a success,” they said.

Several leadership positions have been left vacant, including chief medical officer. Houry resigned from that job in August, citing politicization of the agency.

The Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology lost its director, Jennifer Layden, after she too resigned in August. Kirby’s division — which sits inside that office — also had lost some staff, and needed to restructure.

But because no one had been tapped as acting director of the office, “there was no one to approve those changes” and the plan had to be tabled, Kirby said. “Then the shutdown hit and the RIFs added other pressing issues to resolve.”

Layden’s position is still vacant.

‘Basically a hostile work environment’

In addition to logistical challenges, the volatility has also created an environment where employees often feel they can be ousted at any moment. And they’ve also lost a key layer of protection.

In August, HHS moved to stop recognizing several unions, including one that represents CDC workers at the agency’s Atlanta headquarters.

Nixon, addressing HHS’s decision to stop recognizing the unions, said President Trump implemented Executive Order 14251, which excluded many agencies from collective bargaining, “to remove unnecessary obstacles to mission-critical work and space previously used for union activities.”

As a result, said Jacobs, there is no one to de-escalate conflicts, and more employees than usual are facing disciplinary actions.

Jacobs said they’ve seen more employees placed on performance improvement plans or suspended.

“When the union is in the building, a lot of these disciplinary actions don’t have to escalate to that point, because a lot of times, a lot of those situations can be resolved at much lower level,” Jacobs said.

Nixon said that disciplinary actions have not increased because of the union’s absence. “The suggestion is wrong,” he said.

The first employee said some employees who haven’t yet received a reduction-in-force notice have taken home all of their personal items in case they are suddenly fired.

“Any time that we are asked to unexpectedly meet with senior politicals, we assume it’s to fire us until proven otherwise,” said the first employee. “It’s basically a hostile work environment at this point.”

Many employees will be returning to buildings where bullet holes from the August shooting are still visible in the windows, Kirby said. A stabilizing film has been installed over them, but it doesn’t always obscure the damage.

“When the sun hits the window, the bullet holes and cracks show through,” she said.

Kirby said she heard from the Office of Safety, Security, and Asset Management that the windows could take more than a year to replace because they are custom-made.

“We continue to make necessary repairs and this takes time,” Nixon said.

Kennedy and the CDC

Other HHS subagencies, including FDA, NIH and CMS, have seen fewer rounds of firings than the CDC. The first employee theorized that Kennedy has targeted the CDC. Kennedy reportedly called the agency “a cesspool of corruption” during his 2024 presidential campaign.

During the years that he was active in the anti-vaccine movement, Kennedy would frequently disparage the CDC, claiming the agency was in cahoots with the pharmaceutical industry.

Since he took the helm at HHS in February, he has toned that rhetoric down, and occasionally praised the agency.

“Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty,” Kennedy wrote on X following the shooting at the agency. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”

But after then-CDC Director Susan Monarez was ousted at Kennedy’s urging in August, she testified before Congress and recounted a conversation with Kennedy about vaccines where she said Kennedy emphasized that CDC employees are “horrible people” and said they were “killing children, and they don’t care.”

A spokesperson for HHS said at the time that Monarez’s testimony was “grossly distorting Secretary Kennedy’s concern about the CDC’s failure to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.” And Nixon told POLITICO Thursday that Kennedy “is committed to restoring [the CDC] as the world’s most trusted guardian of public health through sustained reform.”

But some CDC employees aren’t convinced.

“It’s obvious that RFK [Jr.] and the people he had brought into HHS harbor personal animus toward CDC,” the first employee said. “Some of it’s misplaced blame for the pandemic restrictions, but particularly with RFK [Jr.] the animosity started well before the pandemic.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc2%2F89%2F623741c44f49a025aca7628bb53a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2206773664,N,,2025-11-21 15:02:01.411765

Growth in relatively developed technologies, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, grids, and electrified transport, continued in 2024.
China and the advanced economies accounted for 90% of energy transition investment in 2024, contributing 44% and 46%, respectively.
The least developed countries (LDCs) accounted for less than 0.22% of energy transition investments and approximately 2.2% of renewable energy investments.
Energy Transition Investments The report stated that global renewable energy investments in 2024, calculated based on final investment decisions (FIDs), reached $807 billion, rising 22% from the annual average of 2022/2023.","Global investments in energy transition technologies reached a record high of $2.4 trillion in 2024, a 20% increase from the average annual levels of 2022/2023, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) ‘Global Landscape of Energy Transition Finance 2025’ report.

The annual investments in critical transitional technologies, however, remain short of the required levels to align with IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway.

Growth in relatively developed technologies, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, grids, and electrified transport, continued in 2024. However, the growth occurred at a slower pace in earlier years.

Investment in nascent technologies, such as green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, decreased in 2024.

In contrast, battery storage sustained significant growth during the year. The report stated that the investment share in renewable energy remained mostly consistent at 35% in 2024.

The IRENA report said solar is the only technology that has investment levels almost in line with IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario.

According to the report, the drivers and constraints faced by each technology are underpinned by investment distribution and investment amounts.

Critical technologies witnessed a significant disparity in investment distribution, with China and advanced economies being the primary hubs for innovation, deployment, and value creation. China and the advanced economies accounted for 90% of energy transition investment in 2024, contributing 44% and 46%, respectively.

The least developed countries (LDCs) accounted for less than 0.22% of energy transition investments and approximately 2.2% of renewable energy investments. A majority of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Additionally, despite considerable recent progress, annual investments in critical transitional technologies remain short of the required levels to align with IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway.

According to IRENA, annual investments in renewable energy generation must nearly double from the current levels to reach its $1.4 trillion per year target between 2025 and 2030. A significant increase in investment in renewable energy is also required for end uses beyond power, such as heating and transport.

The energy efficiency segment requires the largest increase in investment, needing to grow by seven and a half times to reach the target of $2.6 trillion annually between 2025 and 2030.

Energy Transition Investments

The report stated that global renewable energy investments in 2024, calculated based on final investment decisions (FIDs), reached $807 billion, rising 22% from the annual average of 2022/2023.

Approximately 96% of these investments were in the power sector, reaching $773 billion. Projects such as heating and transport with direct renewable energy use received 1% of the investments, totaling $10 billion.

Current investment levels in renewable energy are roughly half of what is needed to triple power capacity to 11.2 TW by 2030.

Solar is the only technology that has investment levels almost in line with IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario. Solar’s rapid cost decline, as well as global widespread policy support, drove these investments over the previous decade.

Adoption of solar technologies in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) was further driven by distributed systems, such as rooftop projects, as an alternative to grid-based power when it is unreliable, unavailable, or unaffordable.

Annual investments in concentrated solar power (CSP) need to scale up by 32 times from the current levels between 2025 and 2030.

IRENA stated that investments in onshore and offshore wind technology need to scale up by three and eight times, respectively, from the 2024 levels. Wind projects face challenges such as longer permitting processes, grid connection issues, and public resistance in some countries.

Investments in other renewable energy technologies, including marine energy, geothermal power, bioenergy, and hydropower, remain far below the required levels.

The installed renewable energy worldwide is expected to increase by 4,600 GW by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency’s ‘Medium-Term Forecast’ report.

Grid Investments

Power grid investments, including in transmission and distribution, rose 14% in 2024 compared to the 2022/2023 averages, reaching $359 billion.

Annual grid investments need to nearly double to reach $671 billion between 2025 and 2030, to support the integration of renewable energy and the adoption of technologies such as EVs and heat pumps, as was called for under the 1.5°C scenario.

Global spending on grids is projected to continue rising based on recently announced plans. However, most of these plans have been made in China, advanced economies such as Australia, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the U.S., and EMDEs such as India, Brazil, and Indonesia.

However, for many countries, particularly EMDEs and LDCs, the core financing hurdles stem from limited government and utility resources, as well as the inability to recover costs from consumers due to non-cost-reflective tariffs.

IRENA said the private sector may be increasing its share of grid investment in some economies recently. Countries such as India and Brazil are increasingly relying on the private sector to expand their grids.

In economies with grid investments, only 16% of the overall investment in 2024 was directed to new connections, 44% to replacing ageing assets, and the remaining 40% to grid reinforcements.

Over 1,650 GW of wind, solar, and hydro projects were awaiting grid connection in 2024, up from 1,500 GW in 2023. The capacity of queued projects in 2024 was five times the new capacity commissioned in 2022.

In 2023, 65% of global grid investments were financed through market-rate debt. This investment came directly from commercial financial institutions and corporations. Project-level equity accounted for 33% of the investments, and the remaining 2% was funded through grants.

Only one-quarter of global grid investment in 2023, totalling $86 billion, was directed to renewable energy generation.

Battery Storage

Global investment in energy storage reached $54 billion in 2024, increasing 73% from the average investment in 2022/2023, and over 11 times the 2019/2020. IRENA said annual investments would need to triple to align with a 1.5°C pathway.

Battery investment growth was underpinned by a 94% decline in costs between 2010 and 2024. This was driven by scale-up in manufacturing, improved material efficiency, and advancements in manufacturing processes.

China is the largest global battery manufacturer, making up 40% of the worldwide investments in this technology in 2024. It also installed the highest capacity at 84 GWh (36 GW), an 80% growth over 2023, and accounting for half of the global additions. Provincial subsidies, co-location mandates, and the domestic availability of battery technology supported this growth.

China has set a target to install over 180 GW of energy storage capacity by 2027, up from 95 GW as of June this year. The capacity addition will involve an investment of approximately RMB250 billion (~$35 billion).

The U.S. benefited from incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2024, making it the second-largest battery storage investment destination during the year, accounting for 29% of the global total. It added 41 GWh (13 GW), nearly a quarter of the worldwide capacity.

Germany was the third-largest destination for investments, making up 11% of the global total.

Battery storage investments in developing nations such as Chile, India, South Africa, and the Philippines are growing, accounting for 3% of global investments.

Electric Mobility

In 2024, global investments in EVs, including battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs, and fuel cell EVs, rose 33% from 2022/2023 to $763 billion.

The share of EVs in the worldwide car sales increased from 4.4% in 2022 to 22% in 2024. V charging investment grew by 27% in 2024, totaling $39 billion. Public charging received three-quarters of this investment. These chargers reached 5.6 million in number during the first quarter of 2025, increasing by 1.7 million from the end of 2023.

China, along with advanced economies, made up over 95% of the global BEV investment in 2024, remaining largely unchanged during the last five years. Its investment accounted for 49% of the global total.

China’s dominance stems from multiple state initiatives. It also installed 760,000 public fast chargers and one million public slow chargers, more than the rest of the world combined. China made up 60% of the global EV sales in 2022, as a result. It also extended its EV tax incentives in 2023.

Europe made up 23% of the global investment in BEVs in 2024, totaling $97 billion. Its share reduced slightly from 27% in 2022/2023. Growth in BEVs slowed compared to earlier, growing only by 6% since 2022/2023. The U.S. accounted for 19% of BEV investments in 2024, compared to 17% in 2022/2023. Investments rose 35% from $59 billion in 2022/2023 to $ 80 billion in 2024. This was supported by federal incentives, such as tax credits, and by multiple state-level programs. However, many of these investments have since been rolled back.

BEV investments in India and Australia rose by roughly 87% and 33%, respectively, between 2022/2023 and 2024. These investments totaled $8 billion and $4 billion, respectively.

EV Charging

Global governmental investment share in EV charging infrastructure reached 75% in 2024. The remainder was invested by private entities, of which three-quarters was from individuals and households. The remaining investment came from corporations.

Public investments in China with high-density urban living and limited home charger access accounted for 89% of the total EV charging infrastructure funding.

In contrast, in many Western markets, single-family housing enables greater home charging.

In Europe and the U.S., the public sector accounts for 60% and 62% of investments, respectively. U.S. public charging infrastructure investment grew by over 200% from 2022/2023 to 2024, from $1 billion to $3.3 billion. This was driven by programs such as the $5 billion National EV Infrastructure Program.

However, policy changes in early 2025 have disrupted the rollout of further funding by pausing disbursements.

Green Hydrogen

Investments in green hydrogen reduced for the first time in 2024 by 20% compared with 2023. This segment faces considerable economic, policy, and technological challenges. These include high production costs, uncertain demand, and limited transport and storage infrastructure. These hurdles expose projects to multiple risks that have materialised in many high-profile projects, leading to cancellations. Some projects reaching a final close are facing similar challenges.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2023-01-31T135616.191.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:30.676339

U.S. new light-vehicle sales in November 2025 are projected to decline 5.2% year-over-year for a SAAR of 15.4 million units, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData.

New vehicle inventory reached 2.97 million units at the start of November for an 88 days’ supply industrywide, according to analysis from Cox Automotive. This represents a 2.9% increase since the end of September, but a decline of 3.8% compared to November 2024.

A number of automakers are urging major suppliers to find permanent alternatives to Chinese semiconductors in response to the microchip supply disruption involving Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based Nexperia.

The Nexperia supply disruption serves as “a warning shot for global supply chains,” and dependence on China for certain raw materials and technology is likely to increase risk for global automakers, according to commentary from Moody’s and Gartner.

GM directed a number of its suppliers to eliminate the use of China-sourced parts by 2027, according to unnamed sources in Reuters.

Automakers and suppliers are increasingly shifting away from global just-in-time supply chains to prioritize “regional supply chain resiliency.”

On November 18, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) provided an assessment of recent trade developments that included framework agreements with four Latin American countries, a deal with Switzerland, updates on China’s rare earth export controls, and a new White House fact sheet pertaining to the U.S.-Korea deal.

The Wall Street Journal reports China is considering implementing a “validated end-user” system for certain rare earth exports, and this “could make importing certain Chinese materials more difficult” for U.S. companies that have both civilian and defense clients. China dominates the processing of rare earth elements globally.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s plan to impose higher tariffs on certain Chinese imports has been delayed until at least December amid ongoing congressional debate.

The NAM submitted commentary to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative concerning practical steps to strengthen the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). In addition, NAM Vice President of International Policy Andrea Durkin plans to testify during the USTR’s public hearing December 3-5, 2025 regarding the operation of the USMCA.

OEMs/SUPPLIERS

A report published by MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers and consultancy Arthur D. Little includes an assessment of U.S. reshoring constraints and opportunities by auto parts category. The report also notes: “Labor remains the most visible pressure point, as higher wages (including benefits), limited availability, and persistent skills gaps raise costs relative to offshore peers. Automation offers a potential offset, but adoption below Tier 1 is constrained by high up-front investment requirements and limited integrator support.”

Crain’s Detroit reports automotive content at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is likely to emphasize products with near-term market applications over futuristic unproven technologies. The article also noted that certain major suppliers intend to skip CES 2026 amid efforts to reduce costs and maintain profitability.

Toyota CEO Koji Sato provided insights into how the company has achieved record sales and production despite tariffs and market uncertainty.

Honda reported its operating profit fell by 41% YOY for the six months ended September 30, 2025, and the automaker reduced its fiscal 2026 operating profit forecast by 21% due to expenses related to EVs, semiconductor shortages, and U.S. tariffs. Honda recorded 237.3 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in EV-related losses and expenses during the first half of its current fiscal year.

Ford became the second automaker after Hyundai to allow dealers to sell certified pre-owned vehicles through the Amazon Autos site in certain U.S. markets.

MARKET TRENDS AND REGULATORY

The CEOs of the Detroit 3 were invited to participate in a January 14, 2026 hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to discuss topics related to regulation and vehicle affordability.

The benchmark price for aluminum delivered to the U.S. recently hit a record high due to the impact of reduced inventories and import tariffs.

New-vehicle purchasing decisions were impacted by tariffs for 36% of consumers, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) Study.

The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s annual report to Congress warned China could exploit U.S. reliance on its supply chains, and noted that China “now possesses a hyper-charged, state-directed manufacturing base without historic parallel.” The report also urged policymakers to require industry disclosure of vulnerabilities to Chinese supply chains to better assess risk.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

Waymo expanded its robotaxi service to highways in parts of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.

Tesla received a permit to operate ride-hailing services in parts of Arizona with a human safety monitor in the vehicle. The company also operates a ride-hailing pilot program in parts of Austin, Texas, with human safety drivers on board.

Amazon’s Zoox now offers free autonomous rides in parts of San Francisco as part of its early rider initiative, Zoox Explorer.

At Web Summit 2025 in Lisbon, Uber’s Chief Operating Officer discussed the opportunities and challenges associated with profitably commercializing autonomous vehicles. Developing software that supports safe autonomous driving was described as a problem that is “almost largely solved.” Challenges to commercialization include vehicle hardware costs, variable demand, and the inability of autonomous vehicles to respond to certain driving conditions.

Swedish autonomous truck company Einride plans to go public in a SPAC deal that is expected to raise $219 million. The company is seeking an additional $100 million of private investment in public equity to support growth.

HYBRID AND Electric Vehicles

New EV sales in October 2025 were estimated at 74,835 units in the U.S., representing a decline of 30% year-over-year.

Toyota plans to invest $912 million to increase the output of hybrid vehicles and components across five states, as part of a broader $10 billion investment over the next five years to support U.S. production. Toyota’s newly opened $14 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina supplies batteries for the automaker’s hybrid models.

Tesla intends to accelerate a strategy to reduce the use of China-made components in U.S.-manufactured vehicles, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.

Ford is reported to be evaluating whether to permanently end production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck due to profit losses and changing market conditions.

Volkswagen and Rivian are considering selling EV technology developed by their joint venture to other automakers that could be used across a variety of powertrains. Separately, Volkswagen’s electric vehicle brand Scout Motors plans to establish its U.S. headquarters in Charlotte, NC.

BYD established a goal to sell up to 1.6 million vehicles outside of China in 2026.

Battery recycler Redwood Materials has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply critical minerals for domestic supply chains. The company’s Nevada Campus produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year.

Canadian EV battery recycling startup Lithion Technologies filed for creditor protection.

Radioactively contaminated sites. These are just a few of the 249 hazardous sites across the Bay Area that could flood as seas rise in the coming decades in the worst-case scenario, according to a new report published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications.

The researchers project that 5,500 hazardous sites across the nation could be at risk of coastal flooding by the end of the century. Around two-thirds of these facilities are at risk of coastal flooding within the next 25 years, during 100-year flood events. “Historically underserved communities” are more likely to live near hazardous sites prone to flooding, the scientists wrote in a preview of the study.

Researchers from Climate Central, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Nanjing University collaborated on the study.

“The motivation for the study is that sea level rise is rising quickly, often more than projected, and is anticipated to more than double by 2050 worldwide,” said Rachel Morello-Frosch, a professor of environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley.

Seven states account for almost 80% of the hazardous sites at-risk by the end of the century. California is among them with 471 locations. That’s if human-caused climate change continues unchecked. State scientists predict more than a foot of bay rise by 2050 and over 6 feet by the end of the century in the worst-case scenario.

The list includes facilities that pose a risk to public health and communities: contaminated sites, former defense sites, businesses that handle sewage, toxic waste, oil and gas wells and other pollutants.

“We could avoid some of this flooding if we were to stabilize and then reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” said Lara Cushing, associate professor of environmental health sciences at UCLA.

But sea level rise won’t just mean water lapping over shorelines. As the bay rises, it will push groundwater up inland. The researchers noted that there could be more or fewer potential problem sites, as the study did not account for groundwater rise or the increasing intensity of storms.

Previous research examining rising groundwater found that more than 5,000 toxic sites may be impacted along San Francisco Bay alone. A KQED analysis from 2022 found that in the Bay Area community of West Oakland, more than 100 sites are at risk from both rising seas and groundwater.

The new count includes some of the region’s most contaminated sites, like the defunct Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. The U.S. Navy polluted the shipyard soil and groundwater with radioactive chemicals, heavy metals and petroleum fuels when it decontaminated ships, fouling the surface water and sediment in the San Francisco Bay, too. The Environmental Protection Agency declared it one of the nation’s most contaminated sites in 1989.

The research team found that neighborhoods most at risk have a higher “proportion of renters, households living in poverty, residents who identify as Hispanic, linguistically isolated households, households without vehicles, seniors, and non-voters than neighborhoods without at-risk facilities,” the scientists wrote in a press release.

Cushing said there could be as many as 300 fewer places at risk across the country if leaders and companies globally aggressively reduce emissions.

If people come into contact with floodwaters tainted by hazardous materials — sewage from wastewater treatment plants, heavy metals from refineries, or oils from fossil fuel facilities — the health impacts to people ramp up, said Sacoby Wilson, a professor of global, environmental, and occupational health at the University of Maryland.

In the aftermath of a flood, the “toxic soup” people may encounter could exacerbate health conditions. Wilson said exposure, depending on the chemical or sewage, during a flooding event near a hazardous site could lead to fevers, rashes, E. coli-related illness, and other symptoms.

“You have compounding vulnerability when it comes to their socioeconomic status and in some cases, the role of racism that led to that disproportionate burden,” Wilson said.

Federal lawmakers introduced legislation in July that, if passed, would set aside $5 million over the next year for the United States Geological Survey to study and map groundwater rise nationally through 2100. The agency would also need to identify priority areas that are at increased risk of flooding.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2024/09/004_KQED_BayviewBloodTesting_02252022_qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:16.676045

Enviri will sell its Clean Earth environmental services business to Veolia for $3.04 billion, the companies announced Friday.

Enviri also announced it will spin off its Harsco Environmental and Rail businesses into a new, publicly traded company.

Veolia says the deal will double its U.S. hazardous waste footprint and strengthen its presence in healthcare and retail, “allowing it to offer a full range of environmental services on a nationwide basis,” the company stated. Clean Earth has 82 locations, including 19 U.S. EPA-permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities and over 700 operating permits across the country, Veolia said.

The deal is expected to close mid-2026, subject to regulatory approval, Enviri shareholder approval and the completion of the Enviri spin-off transaction.

“Over the past five years, Enviri has significantly enhanced the value proposition of Clean Earth, making it a trusted provider of industrial waste solutions with a strong customer base,” said Enviri Chairman and CEO Nick Grasberger in a statement.

Russell Hochman, who has served numerous roles with Enviri, including senior vice president, general counsel and chief compliance officer, will become CEO of the new Enviri spinoff. He has also been named president and COO of Enviri through the duration of the deal.

Grasberger will stay at Enviri through the completion of the Clean Earth sale and will help with the Enviri transition. The company will announce the board of the new Enviri spinoff in the future.

Veolia considers Clean Earth “a prime asset in the U.S. hazardous waste sector” and sees the Clean Earth portfolio as “highly complementary to Veolia’s.” It estimates the deal will create about $120 million of synergies by its fourth year. Veolia also highlighted expected operational efficiencies from the deal “due to enhanced logistics and expanded treatment capabilities and technologies, including PFAS treatment and new contaminants.”

The deal is also poised to help Veolia to further develop its business in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, areas it says are currently underserved. U.S. economic factors such as increased reshoring production and investments in advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, clean-energy production, healthcare and pharmaceuticals have helped boost its U.S. presence.

Enviri initially acquired Clean Earth for $625 million in 2019, and soon after acquired Stericycle’s Environmental Solutions business for $462.5 million. But Enviri later noted in its annual report that Clean Earth operates in “a very fragmented, regionally-driven market,” leaving room for growth.

Enviri sees the deal as a way to strengthen its balance sheet for its Harsco Environmental and Harsco Rail segments once it spins off into the new company. With the Veolia deal, Enviri plans to repay about $1.35 billion of existing debt. This will leave the new company with a “conservatively capitalized” net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization of about 2x, as well as an undrawn revolving credit facility and a “significant” amount of cash on its balance sheet.

That includes setting aside some of that money to support the Harsco Rail’s engineered-to-order contracts in Europe, said CFO Tom Vadaketh during a Friday call announcing the deal. The company has been working through cost overruns related to these contracts.

“While we’ve made significant progress on these contracts, risk remains, and we are evaluating what would be required to protect against this risk,” he said.

“We remain laser focused on continuing to take actions to stabilize Harsco Rail while leveraging innovation and service capabilities to support Harsco Environmental’s leadership and growth,” Grasberger stated.

The company had originally intended to sell its Harsco Rail business, but announced in August that it instead planned to sell Clean Earth following a strategic review. Harsco Rail has in the past hampered the company’s earnings due in part to unfavorable contracts, the company said.

Harsco Environmental provides onsite environmental services and material processing for the metals industry, and that segment has experienced weakened demand for services due in part to a downturn in the global steel market. During a Q3 earnings call earlier this month, Grasberger noted that upcoming policy changes in the European Union to raise tariffs on imported steel and lower quotas may help the business next year.

This marks the largest deal for Veolia since its 2022 acquisition of Suez, which included a range of assets in North America. The company’s acquisition spending in the U.S. has been relatively muted for waste assets in the years since, aside from a small 2023 deal in Michigan, but that began to change as it completed four deals throughout 2025.

The most notable was the June purchase of California-based Ingenium, which operates eight 10-day transfer stations in multiple states and employed an estimated 160 people. Other deals included Massachusetts-based New England Disposal Technologies and New England MedWaste, as well as Texas-based Chameleon Industries.

Veolia North America largely exited the MSW market by selling its U.S. assets to Advanced Disposal Services in 2012, but the company has also seen recent business gains in that area. Examples include the award of an operating contract for a mass burn combustion facility in Vancouver and multiple anaerobic digestion facilities in Toronto.

But hazardous waste and environmental services remain the primary focus for the North American division of the France-based company. Global CEO Estelle Brachlianoff launched a multiyear strategic plan in 2024, known as GreenUp, that envisions 50% revenue growth in the U.S. by 2027. This includes investments such as a new PFAS treatment plant in Delaware as well as an upcoming hazardous waste incinerator in Arkansas.

Veolia had already finalized an agreement with Clean Earth in 2024 to guarantee capacity at that incinerator, followed by a similar deal with Tradebe Environmental Services.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Technology Transitions Rule increased the cost of new air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, particularly residential central air conditioning systems.

The Proposed Rule would provide additional compliance flexibility and thus help mitigate the cost increases.

The agency should consider additional steps to provide further regulatory relief for consumers.

I. Introduction

The undersigned free-market organizations have a longstanding interest in bringing to light the deleterious consequences of federal regulations, which are often neglected by agencies in their attempts to adopt their regulatory agendas. This is especially the case with regard to the many climate change-related regulations finalized in recent years. For this reason, many of us submitted joint comments to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 concerning the agency’s Allocation Framework Rule implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020. The Allocation Framework Rule set up the agency’s quota system for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a widely-used class of refrigerants that were being targeted under the AIM Act. As we detailed in our comments, the rule and underlying agency analysis ignored the real costs to consumers.

The EPA’s 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, which was also promulgated pursuant to the AIM Act, made things considerably worse for consumers. It outlawed the use of certain HFCs in newly manufactured equipment, including residential air conditioning systems. Many of us also submitted comments on this rule, describing in detail its anti-consumer implications. These concerns have proven correct since the rule took effect on January 1, 2025. Indeed, the summer of 2025 was an extraordinarily expensive one for any homeowner in need of a new central air conditioning system, a direct result of this rule.

Fortunately, the EPA took notice and promised regulatory relief. This has led to the Proposed Rule at issue here.

As will be discussed below, the Proposed Rule offers regulatory flexibility that should partially moderate the cost increases created by the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, and we strongly support it. We also welcome EPA’s request for additional reform ideas and offer several that could lead to further consumer benefits.

II. The AIM Act and Technology Transitions Rule

The primary purpose of the AIM Act is to phase down the production of HFCs based on their claimed contribution to climate change. Currently, the statute requires a 40 percent cut from baseline levels, which will ratchet down to a 70 percent cut in 2029. Not surprisingly, these production limits have led to price increases for these refrigerants and thus have raised repair costs for existing residential and commercial air conditioning and refrigeration equipment that relies upon HFCs. The HFC quotas are administered and enforced by EPA.

While the quotas are mandatory under the law, the AIM Act also includes a section entitled “Technology Transitions” giving EPA discretion to set additional restrictions on the use of HFCs in any category of newly manufactured equipment. Both environmental organizations and equipment manufacturers petitioned EPA to promulgate such restrictions, and the agency obliged them with the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule.

The Technology Transitions Rule sets out requirements for nearly every category of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, but these comments will focus on the provisions applicable to residential central air conditioners. The rule requires that all such new systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use refrigerants with a global warming potential (GWP) of 700 or less.

The majority of residential air conditioners sold in the years prior to this date used the refrigerant HFC-410A. These systems dominated the marketplace for many years (ever since the demise of earlier refrigerants banned for their claimed contribution to ozone depletion) due to their combination of superior affordability and quality relative to other available refrigerants. However, HFC-410A has a GWP above 700 and thus was outlawed in equipment manufactured as of the first of this year.

Two refrigerants have emerged as replacements for HFC-410A in new home air conditioners, HFC-454B with a GWP of 466 and HFC-32 with a GWP of 675. Note that these refrigerants and the equipment designed to use them had lost out to HFC-410A in the marketplace due to various shortcomings, including cost, performance, and safety. But now, these putatively climate-friendlier systems enjoy something close to a captive market as a result of the 2023 rule.

The Technology Transitions provisions in the AIM Act set out a number of factors the agency must consider when setting regulations, including “affordability for residential and small business consumers.” However, the agency dismissed any such concerns by asserting that the new systems “would be expected to have a similar cost…” and even claimed that “overall, the proposed rule is expected to provide net savings to the economy, which may in turn be passed on to small businesses and residential consumers.” Because EPA assumed away any consumer costs associated with the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, the agency’s discussion of the environmental justice implications ignored the potential for adverse impacts on low-income households of costlier air conditioning. This was so despite the well-documented health benefits of air conditioning. Heat-related mortality and morbidity has been shown to be higher among those with low incomes, especially seniors, and the lack of access to air conditioning is a major contributor.

III. The Proposed Rule Would Help Address High Consumer Costs From the Technology Transitions Rule

Reality hasn’t cooperated with the EPA’s optimistic cost projections. The summer of 2025 was the first under the Technology Transitions Rule, and it was an extraordinarily expensive one for homeowners in need of a new air conditioning system. Those in the business of installing such systems report cost increases of about $1,500 for a typical home as a direct result of the rule. This includes increases in equipment and refrigerant costs as well as installation costs since the new refrigerants have a higher flammability classification than HFC-410A and thus require additional precautions during installation. Note that the 2025 increases came on top of the other AIM Act measures that had already raised prices since 2020. A shortage of HFC-454B throughout most of the summer exacerbated matters, though the price hikes for systems using HFC-32 were nearly as substantial.

Unlike the HFC quotas in the AIM Act, the Technology Transitions Rule is discretionary, and the EPA is well within its statutory authority to revisit it. This is especially so given the highly negative consumer impacts – including the disproportionate ones for low-income households – that were completely ignored by the agency during the rulemaking process. Thus, the Proposed Rule is the right course of action.

The EPA had allowed any remaining HFC-410A systems lawfully manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025 to be sold and installed for a year, until January 1, 2026. This deadline is rapidly approaching. The Proposed Rule would extend this sell-through period indefinitely, so that these systems can still be installed until they run out.

Doing so would be positive news for consumers. The manufacturers who had petitioned EPA for the Technology Transitions Rule now enjoy a near captive market for the higher priced compliant systems – which quite likely is the reason they lobbied for this rule. As it stands now, this near-captive market will become a total one on January 1, 2026, and equipment prices could rise even more.

The only escape hatch is the supply of legacy systems, thus keeping them available into next year and beyond would increase choice and lower prices in the residential cooling replacement market. One need not choose an HFC-410A system to benefit from the Proposed Rule, as the added market flexibility would likely serve to lower the cost of HFC-454B or HFC-32 systems once their market monopoly status is weakened. It bears mentioning that any homeowner who still wants the costlier but supposedly eco-friendlier systems would be free to choose them, but it would no longer be the only option available after January 1, 2026.

EPA’s failure to consider significant cost burdens—including impacts on low-income households—constitutes a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 (1983), requiring reconsideration or repeal.

IV. Additional Actions EPA Should Consider

While the Proposed Rule is clearly a step in the right direction, there are questions whether enough of these legacy HFC-410A systems are still around to make an appreciable difference for the 5-6 million American homeowners who purchase a new air conditioning system each year. It may be that the Proposed Rule, if finalized, will provide some measure of relief in 2026 but little or none thereafter. This is why EPA should consider additional steps to ameliorate the substantial costs imposed on consumers, up to and including full repeal of the Technology Transitions Rule.

Full repeal would have a negligible environmental impact. Even assuming the worst of climate change as well as the worst of the HFC contribution to it – and there is plenty of reason not to – the Technology Transitions Rule makes virtually no difference. The stringent HFC quotas elsewhere in the AIM Act will remain in place regardless, thus the Technology Transitions Rule only influences how this dwindling supply of HFCs is allocated. In other words, with or without the Technology Transitions Rule, the same declining volume of HFCs will be produced in the years ahead, either for use in new equipment or the servicing of existing equipment. Indeed, previous comments submitted by many of us suggested that the real purpose of the Technology Transitions section in the AIM Act was to get the air conditioning and refrigeration equipment makers to support the statute with the inducement of regulations creating lucrative captive markets in new equipment using EPA-approved refrigerants. It appears that this has come to pass.

Eliminating the Technology Transitions rule would add to the homeowners’ benefits in the Proposed Rule because it would allow at least some new HFC-410A systems to be manufactured and sold – and not just the remaining units made before January 1, 2025. The manufacture of such additional units would not be unlimited, as the overall HFC quotas would still be in place. But these systems could compete with the HFC-454B and HFC-32 units which would still be available but would lose their federally-guaranteed market dominance.

Absent full repeal of the Technology Transitions Rule, extending the deadlines by several years would also be helpful. Specifically, moving back the January 1, 2025 requirements for residential systems to 2030 would likely make an appreciable difference for consumers.

Note that beyond making changes to the Technology Transitions Rule, there are limited options for consumer relief within the constraints of the AIM Act. Most notably, there is no off ramp should the stringent statutory quotas for HFCs prove costly, as has proven to be the case.

V. Conclusion

The 2023 Technology Transitions Rule made an already-costly AIM Act even more so for consumers by restricting the refrigerants allowed to be used in new residential air conditioning systems. The Proposed Rule would allow continued sales of the remaining HFC-410A systems indefinitely and would be a helpful step that we support. Beyond that, we urge the EPA to do as much as possible to mitigate the consumer damage, and for this reason we encourage the agency to consider more comprehensive changes to the Technology Transitions Rule, preferably full repeal of this regrettable and unnecessary measure. Thank you.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Plastics Pact published a position paper on chemical recycling, which aims to evaluate both the “potential benefits and their associated concerns” as the industry continues to invest in the suite of technologies.

USPP says it “supports the responsible integration” of chemical recycling technologies within a broader circular economy system meant to reduce plastic waste and reliance on virgin plastic. “These technologies may offer solutions for specific hard-to-recycle formats but must not displace efforts focused on reduction, reuse, or mechanical recycling,” it said.

USPP advocates for chemical recyclers to consider environmental justice and health impacts when siting facilities, as well as running such facilities in a way that it has lower emissions than virgin plastic production. It also called for more transparent data collection and third-party lifecycle analysis work to gain more insight into chemical recycling’s true output and effectiveness.

Dive Insight:

USPP’s position paper aims to strike a balance between what the organization considers polarizing opinions on the technologies. That divide can make it harder to fairly evaluate future impacts of chemical recycling on the greater circular economy, the position paper said.

“Too often, these technologies are talked about in extremes — either as a silver bullet or as something to be dismissed outright,” said Jonathan Quinn, president and CEO of the USPP, in a statement.

Chemical recycling, sometimes called advanced or molecular recycling, is a suite of technologies meant to break down plastics to their molecular building blocks to be made into new plastics.

Quinn said the industry, along with organizations signed onto the U.S. Plastics Pact, should think critically about chemical recycling’s potential but also “wrestle with hard problems and consider data-driven real-world solutions.” USPP was created to get major brands and organizations together, in part around shared packaging sustainability goals.

Chemical recycling has recently been a subject of both scrutiny and discussion, including at the federal level. At a congressional hearing in July, some lawmakers and plastics industry groups framed chemical recycling as an economic driver, while other officials and environmental advocates voiced concerns over the technologies’ potential health and environmental risks.

The position paper comes a few days after ExxonMobil announced it hosted U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at its chemical recycling plant in Baytown, Texas. That facility has processed about 100 million pounds of plastics since it opened in 2022, the company said.

“You’re seeing a proof of concept on advanced recycling get developed in a way that may inspire other cities and really this entire country,” Zeldin said in a video about the visit. “The capital investment seems to be extraordinary, and the future potential here seems to be limitless.”

USPP’s position paper calls on the industry to use the EPA’s Waste Management Hierarchy “to prioritize solutions with lower environmental impact.” USPP sees the ideal hierarchy order as starting with source reduction and reuse, followed by mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling would come next in the hierarchy “for formats that cannot be addressed otherwise.”

USPP sees chemical recycling as having the potential to capture more kinds of plastics for recycling, specifically hard-to-recycle types such as films and flexible plastics as well as some food-contact packaging that must meet strict FDA requirements.

It notes that some methods of chemical recycling use heat or chemicals that “can remove more contaminants than just washing the plastic, providing an opportunity to use PCR in some food-contact or medical-grade packaging with stringent quality requirements that cannot otherwise use PCR.”

USPP also sees chemical recycling as a key method for reducing reliance on virgin plastic and boosting the overall economics for recycled content.

The paper also notes that chemical recycling may be an avenue for advancing certain textile recycling goals, since some clothing and carpet are difficult to mechanically recycle. But chemical recyclers should avoid processing items that are “easily handled by mechanical recycling, such as PET bottles,” it said.

Some environmental activists and lawmakers have expressed concerns about chemical recycling’s impact on the environment and human health, a viewpoint that has been a rallying point for community groups who oppose chemical recycling facilities near their homes.

USPP urges the industry to include environmental justice considerations in all siting decisions. It recommends using tools such as California’s Enviroscreen or the archived federal EPA’s EJ Screen tool to determine where communities are most impacted by cumulative impacts of pollution.

The EPA under the Biden administration considered environmental justice an important pillar of its work, but earlier this year, the EPA under the Trump administration closed all of its EJ-related offices and shut down the EJ Screen tool, along with associated initiatives.

USPP “strongly supports the federal government resuming work to identify environmental justice communities and providing this information for companies to use in siting decisions,” it said.

USPP advocates for the chemical recycling industry to adopt manufacturing and regulatory best practices, meant to protect surrounding communities, that ensure safe chemical handling and disposal. USPP also suggests the industry adopt standards such as setting aside funding for potential environmental cleanup or remediation issues that might arise. “Robust standards and safeguards are essential,” USPP said in the report.

USPP also advocates for “use of fair and transparent lifecycle assessments or environmental benchmarks in evaluating facilities” to determine environmental impacts compared to virgin plastic production. An independent third party should evaluate the LCA for credibility, USPP said.

Tesla owns and operates over 75,000 Superchargers across the globe, where drivers can recharge their vehicles up to 200 miles in under 15 minutes.","Tesla’s first third-party owned Superchargers opened in Florida on Thursday.

The eight charging stalls are now open in Land O’Lakes, Bexley, and are branded as Suncoast Charging, a Florida-based EV charging company.

According to its website, the company aims to build a charging network and to improve the charging experience, “making it faster, more reliable, and accessible for all drivers.”

For that, Suncoast will be using “premium Tesla Superchargers for ultra-fast and reliable charging” and provide “NACS [North American Charging Standard] and CCS [Combined Charging System] port accessibility for nearly any EV driver.”

The company’s website shows that, in addition to the Land O’Lakes stalls, it has installed four fast chargers at Wesley Chapel, Lexington Oaks, which are likely Tesla Superchargers.

The charging hubs are open 24 hours a day and support several payment methods. They also include amenities such as “food, beverage, shopping, grocery, and lifestyle options.”

The stalls can be found through the Tesla app or through other navigation apps that support Supercharger live activity.

When questioned if they’re affiliated with the Elon Musk-led company, Suncoast says that “while we proudly utilize Tesla V4 hardware, Suncoast Charging is an independent company with no formal affiliation or partnership with Tesla.”

Supercharger for Business

Suncoast is Tesla‘s first client on the ‘Supercharger for Business’ program, which lets customers purchase and install white-labeled fast-charging stalls.

The chargers come with “the same hardware, software, pricing controls and service as those in Tesla‘s network,” according to the brand’s website.

These include features like downtime alerts and real-time availability, among others.

“We treat your site like we treat our sites,” Tesla says, explaining that customers are provided with “a full-service package that includes network operations, preventative maintenance and driver support.”

Supercharger Network

Superchargers are compatible with all electric vehicles, provided that they support the North American Charging Standard (NACS), which most brands in the US have adopted.

Late last month, EV start-up Slate became the latest automaker to adopt the NACS charging standard, following US EV makers Lucid Motors and Rivian.

Japanese Honda Motor Co., Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors, German-based BMW and Mercedes-Benz, and Sweden-headquartered Volvo and Polestar also use Tesla‘s network.

Earlier this summer, Rivian began updating its charging stations to integrate the port, which will come standard with the upcoming R2 SUV.

Adopting the NACS allows automakers to access over 25,000 Supercharging stalls in the US.

But during the Biden administration, numerous factors slowed progress toward construction, the study found.","Three former Department of Energy staff members have published a study saying the Biden Administration’s clean energy “rollout” was “comparatively slow” and proposing how a future effort can be faster.

“Speed of implementation is imperative,” they emphasized in their report, which they based on interviews with 80 federal employees.

During Biden’s term in office, clean energy progress was encouraging.

The Inflation Reduction Act and two other infrastructure laws allocated more than $1 trillion of funding to clean energy through tax credits, loans and grants, the authors estimate.

The Department of Energy “recast itself” from an agency focused on research and development to “an active commercialization partner.”

More than 900 companies announced new or expanded clean energy and manufacturing projects by January 2025.

But partly because DOE did not move fast enough, the Trump Administration was able to “move rapidly to repeal tax credits, cancel loan commitments, claw back grant funding, and stall projects.”

As a result, the “theory that economic development generated by clean energy projects and industries would create a durable bipartisan coalition was never truly tested.”

Beginning now

To have greater success in the next presidential administration that supports clean energy, detailed planning must begin now, the authors said.

“Ironically, the most salient recent example of such preparatory work was Project 2025,” which led to dismantling federal clean energy efforts.

Enabling the federal government to play an important role in advancing clean energy development “will require more thoughtfulness and detail than even Project 2025 achieved,” the authors say, because it is more difficult to build than to “destroy,” which they say was a focus of Project 2025.

And a clean energy plan must enable the government to move faster than the “slow pace of Biden-era implementation.”

The authors note that just four months after passage of a law creating the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, TVA began construction on the Norris Dam.

But during the Biden administration, numerous factors slowed progress toward construction, the study found.

For example, a focus on obligating funds as the “scoreboard” for progress “created a false sense of accomplishment.” Obligation, the authors note, “indicates a budgetary commitment by the government to outlay funds for something at some time in the future. So obligation does not actually provide the funds to the clean energy project in question.”

It turned out that “a large share of funds was obligated in the last days of the Biden administration, and they were still months or years away from actually being spent on clean energy projects.”

The study provides 14 “implementation ideas” to enable faster construction next time. Among the recommendations are:

Establish an energy strategy actionable in four years

Establish efficient award designs and processes

Create a roster of hundreds of people who can be brought on and trained rapidly to implement within weeks

Rebuild the Department of Energy Adopt milestone-based, pay-for-outcomes support.

The report also lists several processes and approaches that worked well for the Biden Administration, as “example positives to build from.”

The report is titled “Implementing Federal Clean Energy Programs: Lessons Learned from DOE & Partner Agencies.”

Many families in Texas identify with same-sex parents, said Marisa Perez Diaz, a Democratic board member from San Antonio.","Texas’ State Board of Education is scheduled to finalize a state-approved list of instructional materials for the 2025 adoption cycle on Friday — a closely watched decision for education companies selling into the nation’s second-largest K-12 market.

As part of that process, the Republican-majority board began assembling a preliminary list of approved materials this week.

Submissions from three major publishers — HMH, Curriculum Associates, and Scholastic — faced scrutiny, with some board members seeking to remove them from the proposed list of approved learning resources.

Several conservative board members criticized the companies over alleged content issues, including claims their materials promoted critical race theory, social-emotional learning, environmental activism, same-sex couples, and the value of eating insects.

The board is considering materials for: math K-12; language arts grades 6-12 (English and Spanish); phonics K-3; and supplemental math K-12.

Texas serves about 5.8 million K-12 students across roughly 1,200 districts, making it one of the most critical adoption markets in the U.S.

Inclusion on the state-approved list has become critical, after a framework approved in 2023 tied $40 per student in annual funding incentives to the adoption of approved materials.

In the end, materials from the three companies were not removed from the proposed approved list, which would have relegated them to either the state’s preliminary “no-action” or rejected lists. A state law passed earlier this year prohibits districts from buying materials on the rejected list, though companies are allowed to revise and resubmit them for approval.

Despite the pushback, all the materials in question met 100% of state standards and received high-quality ratings from reviewers overseen by the Texas Education Agency. The TEA’s commissioner also recommended their inclusion on the state’s adopted list.

The debate underscores a key point for companies: Meeting technical standards and scoring benchmarks does not insulate a company’s products from scrutiny — whether political or ideological — in Texas.

The state board could revisit these materials when it takes its final vote Friday.

Windmills and Grasshoppers

HMH faced early criticism from speakers who called its authors “woke” and activist during public testimony that kicked off the meeting.

The focus was HMH’s K-5 reading materials.

Tamara McFarlane, who was contracted by TEA to review math curriculum for the 2025 cycle (not ELA), said the HMH text was “anti-American,” and contained “pervasive themes that include global pollution, immigration, and green energy.”

One module in the curriculum, entitled “Energy Island,” was highlighted because it centered on an island in Denmark that uses windmills. Other modules labeled “Project Earth,” and “Global Guardian,” also promote “environmental activism,” said Barbara Denson, who testified at the meeting, and has announced plans to run for the state board next year.

To that, Staci Childs, a Democrat from Houston serving on the state board, defended the lessons, saying “this excites me.”

“I didn’t really have a lot of environmental or a robust science education growing up.”

Another section of the learning resources discussing eco-friendly food also received attention.

Brandon Hall, a Republican board member from a suburb west of Fort Worth, read a passage from the HMH materials: “Dinner is served: on one big plate a juicy hamburger; on the other a heaping pile of grasshoppers. Ground beef or bugs? Which one do you think is better for your body?”

“It’s insane,” he said.

Board member Gustavo Reveles, a Democrat from El Paso, along the Texas/Mexico border, questioned the criticism.

“Many people in my culture eat grasshoppers,” he said. “What do we tell those moms?”

The board voted 7-5 to reject efforts to remove HMH’s materials from the preliminary approved list. The board also voted against other attempts to do the same with HMH’s Spanish-language reading materials, and the company’s supplemental math resources.

HMH did not return a request for comment.

CRT and SEL Concerns

Julie Pickren, a Republican board member from a Houston suburb, raised concerns about critical race theory and social-emotional learning with Curriculum Associates’ K-8 supplemental math products.

Pickren argued “socially responsive goals” in each unit amounted to SEL.

Social-emotional learning is not illegal to teach in Texas’ K-12 schools, but legislation approved this year affects a variety of aspects of SEL implementation, including a ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and prohibiting instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity.

Childs, the Democratic board member from Houston, said she spoke with Curriculum Associates and they assured her there’s no SEL in the math lessons. She added that culturally responsive teaching is not the same thing as critical-race theory, noting that reviewers did not flag any SEL or CRT issues.

“What we’re hearing is conjecture and political ideology,” Childs said.

Asked by another board member if she’d prefer the learning resources contained “culturally unresponsive” elements, Pickren said that Curriculum Associates should have focused its products to teach through a “patriotic lens.”

“It would have been wonderful to actually see instead of … culturally responsive training if we could have seen something that was patriotic to connect Texas students to a fondness and love of freedom to Texas and America,” she said.

The board voted 10-3 to keep the materials on the preliminary approved list.

Same-Sex Parents and Pilgrims

Scholastic’s K-3 phonics materials survived a 7-6 vote to remain on the proposed approved list.

Pickren requested the learning resources be moved to the preliminary rejected list because a book — which she claimed was part of the materials — is about a girl with two dads, which could violate the state’s DEI ban or prohibition on teaching about sexual identity. She also alleged the materials had a factual error claiming pilgrims from Plymouth founded Jamestown (the English founded the settlement).

That drew a rebuke from some board members.

Many families in Texas identify with same-sex parents, said Marisa Perez Diaz, a Democratic board member from San Antonio.

“I almost feel like a removal (from the proposed approved list) just based on that is quite discriminatory,” she said

Hall, the Republican member from the Fort Worth suburb, responded:

“I know for my district that directly putting stories into curricula about two dads and alternative lifestyles doesn’t match the good Christian values of my district.”

Scholastic denied the accusations in a statement to EdWeek Market Brief, saying a state board member “incorrectly suggested that the program included a particular book, which is not published by Scholastic, as well as inaccurate history lessons, which is not a subject covered by the program.”

“Scholastic can unequivocally confirm that the referenced title and content are not and have never been in the Ready4Reading program,” the company’s statement said. “We are eager to move forward in the IMRA process.”",https://epe.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/831b330/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1720x1150+0+0/resize/942x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fepe-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F47%2F185dac75495068120a2dac86a1a2%2Ftexas-flag-getty-image.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:51.417765

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,” he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/98/6985020c-f120-4142-a30f-c1e5b47e836f/691f959e07ea0.preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:04:03.060106

I applaud Representative Johnson for spearheading this bipartisan effort to modernize permitting technology, and I look forward to working with him to move this bill forward in Congress.”

“Our permitting system is still burdened by an outdated, paper-based processes that slow down the projects Americans are counting on — from transportation and broadband to clean energy and climate-resilient infrastructure,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA). “The ePermit Act moves us toward a modern, efficient, fully digital permitting system that will cut red tape, and today’s passage brings us one step closer to delivering results faster. As energy costs continue to rise across the country, it’s important we meet the growing demand for electrification, data centers, and clean-tech manufacturing. I look forward to continuing this momentum and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to meet the growing demand in California, and across our country, and get this over the finish line.”

What industry leaders are saying about the ePermit Act:

“We applaud Representatives Dusty Johnson and Scott Peters for their innovative approach to modernizing the federal permitting process through the ePermit Act. By establishing a digital permitting portal and standardized data framework for permitting documents, this legislation will enhance clarity, uniformity, and efficiency across federal agencies. It will also improve transparency, facilitate real-time collaboration, and ensure better public access, ultimately streamlining the permitting process and our ability to develop critical infrastructure that will benefit Americans across the country,” saidChad Whiteman, Vice President, Environment and Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

“American Council of Engineering Companies, the business voice of the nation’s engineering industry, supports passage of H.R. 4503, the ePermit Act and applauds Representatives Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) for their leadership on this important bipartisan legislation. The ePermit Act will modernize how federal agencies use technology to facilitate more efficient and timely federal permitting decisions. If passed, the bill will help to cut red tape by enhancing transparency, improving stakeholder engagement, and facilitating efficient interagency collaboration.”

“Our outdated permitting process is incapable of meeting the challenge of rising demand. This bipartisan bill will ensure federal agencies leverage technology to speed up environmental reviews. It's a critical piece of the broader permitting reform necessary to let America build,” said Jeremy Harrell, CEO, ClearPath Action.

“Manufacturers continue to support permitting reform to unleash American manufacturing competitiveness. The ePermit Act will increase efficiency and transparency in the permitting process, making it easier for manufacturers to push beyond the red tape, grow facilities and create jobs,” saidCharles Crain, Managing Vice President of Policy, National Association of Manufacturers.

“National Association of Home Builders commends Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) for introducing the ePermit Act, legislation that would address housing affordability challenges by improving and expediting the environmental review and permitting processes. Permitting roadblocks delay housing projects and raise construction costs. This legislation will bring clarity, efficiency and certainty to the permitting process by requiring the use of electronic permitting platforms,” saidBuddy Hughes, Chairman, National Association of Home Builders.

""The American Petroleum Institute supports the ePermit Act as a critical step toward modernizing the nation’s outdated permitting system. By improving the process and enhancing transparency through digital tools, this legislation will improve efficiency to support the energy projects we need to meet rising demand. We commend Representatives Peters and Johnson for their leadership in advancing American energy and for spearheading efforts to bring federal permitting into the 21st century,” said Kristin WhitmanSenior Vice President of Federal Government Affairs at American Petroleum Institute.

“BPC Action celebrates the bipartisan efforts of Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) to optimize technology to modernize federal environmental review and permitting processes for infrastructure projects involving roads, bridges, mines, factories, power plants, and more. The ePermit Act, introduced today, will provide greater transparency and predictability on environmental review and permitting schedules for sponsors and stakeholders. We commend this small, but important, step forward to improve our permitting processes,” saidMichele Stockwell, President, Bipartisan Policy Center Action.",https://dustyjohnson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/dustyjohnson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/2.png,N,,2025-11-21 14:01:52.767319

Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.
California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.

Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers?","Farm state politicians have been trying for more than a decade to pass legislation that would allow E15 — gasoline containing 15% ethanol — to be sold year-round across the country. While E15 can be sold from Sept. 15 to June 1 each year, an antiquated glitch in the Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel regulations prevents gas stations from offering it each summer when America’s roadways are the busiest.

When I served in Congress, we got close and for his part, President Donald Trump tried to use administrative powers to remove that glitch during his first term in 2019. But, threatened by the competition of more ethanol, oil refiners sued to stop Trump — and they won. The courts found that only Congress can permanently remove the summertime E15 barrier.

So, with the 2025 congressional calendar ticking away, year-round E15 remains stuck in the mud and Big Oil’s ethanol barricade remains in place. Meanwhile, corn farmers are harvesting the largest-ever crop in history, corn prices are plummeting, farm bankruptcies are on the rise, and grain is piling up across the Midwest. Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.

E15 typically sells for 10-30 cents less per gallon than regular gasoline, meaning the summertime barrier prevents consumers from accessing a lower-cost, cleaner-burning option that includes a higher content of American-made fuel.

But here is the ironic twist. On Oct. 2, with the stroke of a pen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom did what President Trump and Midwest lawmakers haven’t been able to do. He signed Assembly Bill 30 into law, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California, the nation’s second-largest gasoline market.

In signing the bill, Newsom stated, “While we continue the critical work to stabilize our state’s fuel market, we’re cutting red tape to provide consumers with more options as we continue our transition to cleaner transportation.” He also cited a recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy, showing E15 “could lower gasoline prices by up to $0.20 per gallon and save Californians as much as $2.7 billion annually.”

Because California has its own unique gasoline specifications, the seemingly immovable EPA summertime barrier that bedevils states across the country simply doesn’t apply in the Golden State. California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.

Newsom’s move to allow year-round E15 could boost demand for ethanol by 600 million gallons, providing a sorely needed increase in corn demand. If California gas stations adopt E15 statewide, over 200 million bushels of additional corn — equivalent to the entire annual corn crop in Texas or Kentucky — will be needed to satisfy the new demand.

Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to promote the idea that Newsom and California have “waged war on liquid fuels.” Yet, the allowance to sell E15 year-round in the state would cement California as the single largest market for corn ethanol in the country.

All of this leads to some natural questions. Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers? If California, the bastion of electric vehicles, can get it done, why can’t our leaders in Washington? If the president and his fellow Republicans want to “Make America Great Again” doesn’t that start with supporting American workers and helping all Americans save money?

While farmers are caught in Trump’s trade war, the president and Republican lawmakers appear headed for yet another round of bailout payments, rather than creating new demand opportunities for our nation’s corn and soybean growers. If they really want to help America’s farmers, they should simply follow California’s lead and do whatever it takes to allow year-round, nationwide E15 sales as quickly as possible.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/biofuelnozzle-2048x1346.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:34.176632

Despite the coal-friendly flip in US energy policy this year, the solar power revolution is here to stay. A case in point is the iconic coal-producing Appalachian state of West Virginia, where sheep are beginning to pull double duty as solar ambassadors.

Solar Power Trickles Into West Virginia

To be clear, West Virginia’s solar journey has barely gotten off the ground. Solar advocates in the state have dreamed of transforming derelict coal mines into solar power plants since 2011, if not before, with little to show for it. In 2020, for example, West Virginia held down the #49 spot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, with only 10.52 megawatts to its name and a five-year projection of just 154 megawatts more.

Five years later, the state has over-performed that estimate by a respectable margin, coming in at 219 megawatts as of Q2 2025. Still, that’s not even treading water in this day and age. West Virginia actually lost ground to other states. It currently hits the bottom-most ranking of #50, according to data compiled by the Solar Energy Industries Association.

That could be about to change. The global firm Enel has spotted an opportunity in Brandonville, in the northern part of the state. Plans are in the works for a 100-megawatt solar power plant that has been reportedly been fast-tracked by the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

The Real Estate Factor

Or, not. Fossil energy stakeholders have held an unusually heavy grip on state policy for generations, which helps to explain why West Virginia officials are welcoming a new $144 billion loan from the US Department of Energy, earmarked to freshen up six aging coal power plants to last up to 20 years longer.

The real estate factor also comes into play. The American Farmland Trust is among the organizations pointing out that low-density housing — aka country homes — are among the biggest threats faced by farm conservation advocates, either by replacing farmland directly or by blocking farmer access to land.

The pressure from real estate interests is evident in the Brandonville project. On November 19, the news organization Dominion Post noted that only seven letters of protest have been registered so far over the project, but at least three of them advocate for real estate development of one sort or another.

“This small slice of West Virginia paradise should be reserved for the people who want to build homes, carve out homesteads, and keep the farmlands as they’ve been for years,” reads one somewhat self-contradictory comment (emphasis added).

“It’s one of the few areas in West Virginia where there’s good, usable land and is within commuting distance of good jobs,” reads another, skipping over the farm conservation angle entirely.

Similarly, another commenter is not concerned about any kind of land conservation, stating that “flat developable land would be tied up for over 30 years.”

The Sheep Factor

Into this picture steps the emerging solar grazing industry. In contrast to housing, strip malls, industrial parks, fulfillment centers and other forms of farmland replacement, solar power plants can host farm activities while fostering nutrient replenishment in the underlying soil. Without long swaths of asphalt and other permanent infrastructure, the land within a solar power plant can be returned to full farm use after the solar panels reach the end of their lifespan.

The emerging field of scientific research and professional expertise known as agrivoltaics, or agri-solar and agri-PV, is already taking shape in the livestock industry, where sheep are a good match for solar power plants. The solar grazing movement has taken off like a rocket in Texas with Enel playing a leading role there (see more agrivoltaics background here).

No word yet on whether or not Enel plans to introduce solar grazing in the Brandonville project, but sheep are beginning to appear at other solar power plants around the state.

It’s just a drop in the bucket compared to West Virginia’s coal power profile, but one sign of progress is the Mon Power branch of the sprawling energy firm FirstEnergy Corp., which has recruited 350 sheep to trim vegetation on an 18.9-megawatt solar power plant adjacent to the Fort Martin Power Station in Maidsville.

In a press statement, First Energy VP Dan Rossero made an enthusiastic pitch for agrivoltaics. “We’re managing this site with an innovative approach that blends renewable energy and agriculture for the benefit of our community. Solar grazing allows us to keep the site operating efficiently while supporting local farmers and reducing our environmental footprint,” Rossero said.

“By partnering with sheep farmers and advancing solar power, we’re making a positive impact that extends well beyond the fence line,” he emphasized.

More Solar Power Plants, More Sheep…

Solar grazing has emerged as a way for solar developers to cut the cost of conventional mowing and other vegetation management systems, needed to keep plants from overgrowing the solar panels. FirstEnergy also points out that sheep can graze directly underneath the solar panels, where conventional mowing equipment is difficult to operate.

The Fort Martin site is one of three solar grazing operations hosted by Mon Power, all located on brownfields and other former industrial properties. All together, the three sites have a capacity of 30 megawatts.

Toyota is emerging as another solar grazing fan in West Virginia. The company operates a 2.6-megawatt solar array at its Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia facility in Buffalo. At one time, the five-acre array was billed as the largest solar power plant in West Virginia, and now it also hosts sheep during the grazing season, from April to October.

“Sheep have a carbon footprint far lower than the typical commercial mower and, unlike large mowers, they don’t spray rock and debris, which could crack or damage the solar panels,” Toyota enthuses.

The company also notes that vegetation management is among the major expenses of a solar power plant, making sheep a bottom-line partner in the solar industry. “Sheep farmers benefit, too,” Toyota observes. “They can add a new revenue stream by leasing land for solar arrays, or, in cases where they need to allow their land to lay fallow to regenerate, they can lease land with solar panels and rotate the flock.”

Among other farmer-related benefits, solar grazing provides sheep farmers with access to grazing lands protected against predators by high-quality perimeter fencing. Research also indicates that shade from the solar panels retains moisture in the soil, enhancing the quality of the grazing grounds while contributing to sheep health and wool quality, too.

Meanwhile, researchers at West Virginia point out that the state’s hilly terrain limits the opportunities for crop farming. However, solar grazing could provide an opportunity for the next generation of up-and-coming farmers to enter the agriculture business.

“Currently, 68% of agricultural producers in West Virginia have some sort of off-farm income because they cannot make a living in agriculture alone,” WVU observes, adding that “the idea of new and greener technology may appeal to younger generations, as the average age of agricultural producers in West Virginia is around 70.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-grazing-first-energy-wv.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 15:01:53.911464

Felipe Munoz at JATO Dynamics told Reuters recently that Chinese automakers face a price war in China that makes it difficult for them to make a profit in their home market. The answer for many companies is to export those excess new vehicles to other countries. Lately, Central and South America have become a hot new market for Chinese-made EV products

The Chinese have “carved out space,” for both electric and conventional cars, said Martin Bresciani, president of Chile’s automotive business chamber, CAVEM. “The Chinese have already demonstrated that they match global standards in quality.” Chinese brands reached 29.6% of all new passenger car sales in Chile in the first quarter of this year.

The share of EV sales in South and Central America has doubled this year compared to 2024. The total across the entire region is just 4%, but in some markets, that percentage is much higher. In September, EV sales in Chile were 10.6%, 9.4% in Brazil, and 28% in Uruguay. BYD is the market leader in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay.

Part of China’s success has been partnering with trusted local importers to offer more affordable models tailored ​to regional tastes, according to seven dealerships Reuters spoke to in Peru, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. In Uruguay, BYD is the third largest brand behind only Chevrolet and Hyundai and now has a 22% market share in that country.

Boosting Market Share

Chinese brands such as BYD are pulling every lever to gain market share. In Uruguay, Gonzalo Elgorriaga, who owns a luxury car dealership, told Reuters, “The Chinese struck first and struck hard.” They collaborate with local banks to offer credit lines, but they also are highly competitive on price. The least expensive EV from BYD costs just $19,000. “I can buy three Chinese pick-ups, for the price of two traditional brands. That’s a big difference,” said Federico Guarino, another Uruguayan car dealer,

There is more to it than just price. As part of its Belt and Road strategy, China constructed a new state of the art port facility in Chancay, Peru. While the port is available to all ships, it makes things especially convenient for those bringing in cars from China.

“Each ship brings 800 to 1,200 vehicles,” Gonzalo Rios, deputy manager at Cosco Shipping, the port operator, told Reuters. Cosco expects the total number of vehicle arrivals from China to reach 19,000 by the end of the year.

From Chancay, the cars are distributed to Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia. Chery is also using the port to bring its cars to South and Central America. Peruvian ​customs data shows that in July, 3,057 cars arrived at the port, up from 839 in January. Peru does not have a large scale car manufacturing industry to protect from the sale of Chinese cars.

EVs In Brazil

The situation is different in Brazil, the largest country in South America. There the arrival of Chinese companies has lead to tensions. Unlike Peru, Brazil has a tariff structure that encourages companies to manufacture vehicles locally. BYD began assembling EVs at a former Ford factory in Bahia in October and Great Wall Motors launched partial production in August at a repurposed Mercedes-Benz facility.

Ricardo Bastos, of GWM Brazil and president of the country’s EV association, said the company expects to begin exporting vehicles from its Brazil factory to the region by 2027, thanks to favorable trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, and the South American trade bloc Mercosur. “Brazil was the third country to receive a Great Wall factory ‍after Russia and Thailand. It’s a strategic decision, showing the strength Latin America has,” ⁠Bastos said.

Brazilian industry and labor groups say China is taking advantage of temporarily low tariff barriers for EVs to ramp up its exports rather than investing to build Brazilian factories and create jobs. BYD has also faced scrutiny over reports of poor conditions for some workers at its new Bahia plant. The government has since moved to re-impose import duties of up to 35% by the middle of next year.

Brazil could soon challenge Chancay in Peru as a regional distribution center. The port of Vitoria on Brazil’s southeastern Atlantic coast currently leads in national vehicle imports and the port of Itajai further north recently received a shipment of 22,000 vehicles. BYD’s country manager for Argentina, Stephen Deng told Reuters in October that the company was expecting arrivals from Brazil in 2027. “I think we could eventually see Argentina adopting the same EV rates that we see in Brazil.”

EV charging infrastructure along many South American travel routes is still in its infancy, a fact that has led many drivers to use a low cost electric car for their daily driving needs, while keeping a conventional car in reserve for longer trips. The lowest priced EVs can only go a relatively short distance before needing to be recharged.

EVs In Uruguay

Uruguay, which is located just south of Brazil, is one of the smallest countries in South America but is a leader in the EV revolution. It is also a leader in clean energy technologies. EVs accounted for about a quarter of all new vehicle sales in Uruguay through October — more than double last year’s share. Sales of electric cars are helped by a zero import duty, excise tax exemptions, and gasoline that costs more than $7.00 a gallon. That combination of factors — which sounds a lot like how Norway began its transition to EVs — is attracting lots of customers for electric cars.

About 90% of the 11,000 EVs sold this year in Uruguray came from Chinese brands such as BYD, JAC, and Omoda. The BYD Seagull costs just under $20,000 and can save drivers significant money in fuel costs if they charge at home. However, most of those inexpensive cars from Chinese companies have a fairly short range, which makes them unsuitable for longer journeys in a region where fast charging along major transportation routes is still lacking.

Maria Clara Sole lives near Montevideo, the capitol city of Uruguay. She told the Detroit News she typically drives about 60 kilometers (37 miles) a day commuting to work and shuttling her children around in the BYD Yuan Pro she and her husband purchased last year. She estimates she saves up to $400 per month by charging her SUV at home versus filling the tank of a conventional car at a gas station.

She and her husband also own an SUV with a gasoline engine, which they use for longer road trips. “We aren’t ready to go fully electric with both cars. There’s still some uncertainty — especially if I want to drive to Argentina or Brazil. That possibility is limited if it’s not a gasoline powered car,” she said.

Software engineer Nicolas Jodal drives a Tesla Model X, one of a handful of Teslas imported to South America every year. He told Detroit News that electric cars are “extremely cheap to operate. I don’t think I manage to spend 500 pesos ($12) a month” on electricity. After experiencing his Tesla, he said the internal combustion engine is “an outdated technology that has no future, at least for passenger transport vehicles.”

Uruguay exempts EVs from its 23% import duty and the excise tax on passenger vehicles. Gasoline costing about $7.40 per gallon and a growing network of charging stations nationwide have also helped make electric cars a more popular choice for its 3.5 million citizens. The most common brands of conventional cars sold in Uruguay come from Ford, Fiat, or Toyota — all of which have shunned the EV opportunity so far.

Uruguay’s use of tax incentives to boost adoption could serve as a model for other small countries that do not currently have a domestic auto manufacturing industry to protect, Rafael Rabioglio, the head of research for Bloomberg NEF in Latin America, said. Bloomberg now forecasts battery-electric and plug-in hybrid sales will total more than 400,000 this year — about 8% of the new car market in Latin America. That’s up from just 2% in 2023. “If it wasn’t for the Chinese, I’m not sure we would have seen this transition happening recently in Latin America,” Rabioglio said.

The good news is that Chinese companies are able to sell competitive electric vehicles in South and Central America at prices that are equivalent to gasoline-powered models. The not so good news is that mainstream automakers from the US and Europe are unable or uninterested in doing the same.

The region has a patchwork of import duties and EV incentives, which makes it difficult to make accurate predictions about the future of EVs there, but the transition to electric mobility has begun and shows every sign of gaining momentum, thanks to the supply of electric cars from Chinese manufacturers.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/p2-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:46.139797

South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there.
First Solar is poised to deliver a financial boon to Iberia Parish, said Reuven Proenca, director of global brand, corporate, and marketing communications at First Solar.
The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.
In an energy-hungry America, Antoun said, solar remains the cheapest and most quickly deployable form of energy.","When Georges Antoun came to Louisiana from Lebanon in the early 1980s, he needed money.

The country was entering an oil crisis, and cities along the Gulf Coast — especially places like Lafayette that depended on oil and gas jobs — felt the hit first.

As families moved to larger cities like Houston in search of work, Antoun began offering a service: For a fee, he’d drive their moving trucks back to Louisiana.

It's no secret that Louisiana has long lost talent to its western neighbor and has sought ways to entice them back.

The opening of First Solar's $1.1 billion solar panel manufacturing facility near New Iberia has allowed Antoun, now the company's chief commercial officer, to have conversations with families who have chosen to return to Louisiana to work at the facility, which will celebrate its grand opening on Friday after the project was announced just over two years ago.

The 2.4 million-square-foot mega complex is one of the largest investments in the Acadiana region and is expected to provide over 800 jobs by the end of 2025.

It is now the company's fifth U.S. manufacturing facility and is expected to help fuel America's growing energy needs all while using a 100% American supply line. The opening comes on the heels of First Solar's recent announcement that it would build a $330 million plant in the town of Gaffney, South Carolina.

The Louisiana investment is already paying dividends, with Acadiana manufacturers like Noble Plastics announcing in September that it would undergo an $8.5 million expansion to supply the New Iberia location. Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.

""You feel the impact immediately, ""Antoun said. ""I'm very proud, given that I'm a Louisiana boy. ""

The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added. The state, known for its damaging hurricanes and flooding, at first made the board uneasy, but it had one thing going for it — a highly skilled, easily transferable workforce.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette and South Louisiana Community College were also eager to help win over the company, providing a curriculum and simulated training for new hires, and tapping the university for a large portion of its workforce.

""Pushback is normal,"" he said. ""Louisiana is a tough place to build. South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there. Flooding, tax-wise, insurance-wise. This took a bit of doing and bringing it here. But the company was committed to drive it in here.""

""(UL-Lafayette) produces a tremendous amount of engineers and technical degrees, and a lot of folks don't want to leave the area. They want to stay here.""

First Solar is poised to deliver a financial boon to Iberia Parish, said Reuven Proenca, director of global brand, corporate, and marketing communications at First Solar. The company is expected to contribute the equivalent of $150 million to the parish's GDP in the first year of operation.

The company will also provide high-paying jobs averaging $80,000 to $90,000, totaling $75 million in annual labor income, according to data collected by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at UL.

Antoun also believes the company will likely continue its rapid growth as the largest solar panel manufacturer in the western hemisphere. Just seven years ago, the company could produce around 2.5 gigawatts of solar panels a year, compared to the 17.7 GW it expects to create once the South Carolina facility is operational.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for renewable energy well known over the years, going as far as sunsetting Biden-era solar tax credits earlier than they were set to expire. The decision killed dozens of early-stage utility-scale solar projects planned for Louisiana.

ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.
“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.
A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,"" he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/04a961826cd7c56f6e35579aecd9b779,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:43.334231

Regenerative Farming: A Simple Way to Heal Soil and Cut Emissions

Regenerative agriculture is becoming a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. It helps the soil store more carbon, keeps water in the ground, and strengthens farms against extreme weather.

Carbon by Indigo: Empowering Farmers With High-Value Carbon Credits

Farmers who join Carbon by Indigo receive guidance on practices like:

Planting cover crops

Reducing tillage

Rotating crops

Using nitrogen more efficiently

These methods build healthier soil and reduce runoff. They also improve air quality and make farmland more resilient over time.

The company produces high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits that help farmers strengthen their bottom line while enabling corporations to reduce risk by supporting carbon removals, emission reductions, and water benefits.

Under its standard program, the company returns 75% of the carbon credit purchase price to the farmer.

Even though water conditions vary by region, the project achieved a notable result: on average, each metric ton of carbon removed conserved approximately 69,000 gallons of water. This demonstrates how regenerative practices enable farmers to adapt to changing climate conditions while enhancing productivity.

Supporting 150 Farmers Across Five States

Honda’s investment supports about 150 farmers near its U.S. operations in Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Altogether, these farmers manage 214,000 acres of farmland using regenerative methods.

Importantly, all carbon credits in the Carbon by Indigo program are independently verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve, a widely trusted carbon registry.

Honda’s Road to Decarbonization: Cutting Emissions From Products and Operations

Honda has shown leadership in environmental efforts for over 50 years. Now, the company is moving quickly toward an electric and low-carbon future.

It reported 296.86 million t-CO₂e in total global greenhouse gas emissions for FY2025. About 80% of these emissions come from product use (Scope 3 Category 11). The remaining 20% comes from direct operations and upstream/downstream activities.

Because of this, Honda is prioritizing emission cuts from product use and business operations. The company aims to reach full carbon neutrality by 2050, aiming to increase sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in North America and other major markets.

Triple Action to ZERO: Honda’s Framework for a Sustainable Future

Honda’s clean energy target is ambitious, and its environmental vision is shaped by its “Triple Action to ZERO” strategy, which includes:

Carbon Neutrality – achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions

Clean Energy – switching fully to carbon-free energy sources

Resource Circulation – creating products with sustainable and recyclable materials

These three actions connect to global climate and biodiversity goals. Honda also supports Nature-based Solutions, such as restoring forests and ecosystems, to increase its positive environmental impact.

Honda also trains suppliers through the Green Excellence Academy and supports dealerships through the Environmental Leadership Program, so the entire value chain can lower emissions.

Protecting Biodiversity Across the Globe

Honda is protecting ecosystems near its facilities through forest projects and greenbelt expansion. In Ohio, the company created the Honda Power of Dreams Forest, planting 85,000 trees over 40.5 hectares to restore riparian zones and create wildlife habitats.

Similar initiatives are underway in Europe and Brazil. In Belgium, Honda is restoring black poplar trees and building insect hotels and ponds to boost biodiversity. In the Amazon rainforest, Honda maintains 80% of its motorcycle test course as a protected conservation area and supports replanting endangered species like mahogany and rosewood.

A Long-Term Commitment to a Cleaner Future

Honda’s partnership with Carbon by Indigo reflects its broader mission to cut emissions, expand clean energy, and support sustainable communities. Through regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, circular manufacturing, and biodiversity programs, Honda is building a pathway toward a Zero Environmental Impact Society by 2050.

Advertisement Regulators, though, allowed substantial flexibility in which land NECEC proposed to conserve, and how.
The land will be administered as a working forest conservation easement by the Maine Bureau of Lands and Parks.
Environmental groups expressed concerns that Wednesday’s approval will set a dangerous precedent for future developments.","Three big takeaways:

With this final approval, Central Maine Power’s controversial transmission line eight years in the making can complete construction and connect to a Canadian hydropower plant.

Environmental groups argued the conservation plan does not sufficiently protect mature forest land and maintain habitat connectivity, but state regulators disagreed.

The connection to Hydro-Québec’s plant will introduce 1,200 megawatts to the New England grid — a move that NECEC says could lower electrical utility costs across Maine by more than $14 million per year.

State regulators approved a 50,000-acre conservation plan this week for the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line through rural northwestern Maine, clearing a final hurdle for the project’s completion.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s approval Wednesday marked the end of an eight-year saga to authorize the 53-mile line and connect a Canadian hydroelectric plant to a converter station in Lewiston through remote portions of Franklin and Somerset counties. Construction is expected to be finished by the end of the year.

NECEC, a partner of Central Maine Power Co. and a subsidiary of CMP parent Avangrid, began planning the project in 2017 and faced immediate opposition from Maine-based environmental groups, who said the project would have serious impacts on habitats, scenery and natural resources.

State environmental regulators required the permanent conservation of about 78 square miles near the line earlier this year as mitigation for those environmental and ecological concerns.

NECEC submitted its conservation plan in May. Regulators at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined that plan satisfied their requirements.

“This achievement is the culmination of years of hard work, collaboration, and perseverance,” Avangrid CEO Jose Antonio Miranda said in a news release Wednesday. “We have secured every permit, met every regulatory requirement, and overcome significant challenges because we believe we must address the urgent need for reliable energy at a time of rising demand. Today, we stand ready to deliver on that promise.”

Environmental groups argued the proposal didn’t go far enough and should have been rejected. Forests in the area have been heavily harvested, the groups argued, and the value of the conserved land didn’t meet habitat connectivity standards, given that it is split by U.S. Route 201 and other roads and transmission lines. The NECEC transmission line itself requires a 150-foot-wide swath of cleared land.

The groups were especially frustrated with NECEC’s proposals for conserving “mature forest.”

“NECEC came up with their own definition of what constitutes a mature forest and told regulators to wait nearly half a century for trees to just barely meet that flawed definition,” the Appalachian Mountain Club, Maine Audubon, Natural Resources Council of Maine and Trout Unlimited said in a joint statement. “The DEP has wrongly accepted this approach, setting an unacceptable precedent that Maine’s other natural resources agencies urged against.”

WHAT’S IN THE CONSERVATION PLAN?

Following a 29-month permitting process, the Maine DEP required NECEC to develop a plan to conserve land near the transmission line, saying the project would have “substantial impacts” that required extensive mitigation measures to “avoid or minimize those impacts.”

State regulators set a high bar for the conservation area, including promoting habitat connectivity, conserving “mature forest” areas and providing wildlife travel corridors.

Regulators, though, allowed substantial flexibility in which land NECEC proposed to conserve, and how.

NECEC chose a 50,000-acre area owned by Weyerhaeuser Co. — a lumber company and one of the largest private landowners in the United States — which it plans to acquire for an unspecified fee. The parcel is made up of several stretches of forest and wetland that are separated by U.S. Route 201, the transmission line itself and other power lines.

Public access to the land will be guaranteed in perpetuity, even beyond the decommissioning of the NECEC project.

The land will be administered as a working forest conservation easement by the Maine Bureau of Lands and Parks. It connects to 400,000 other permanently conserved acres, creating one of the largest contiguous conservation areas in the state.

As a working forest, the land will be open for logging, except for no-cut buffers around streams and wetlands. NECEC proposed operating the land as a “shifting mosaic” — meaning the location of mature forest to shift over time, as long as at least half of the working forest is mature after 2065.

This was a big sticking point for critics of the project. Habitat connectivity was a central part of the state’s requirements, given the impact of the transmission line cutting through the rural Maine woods.

Environmental groups said maintaining “mature forest” would be nearly impossible if most of the land was open for logging.

The groups also argued that the area doesn’t actually include much mature forest at all. Using remote sensing techology LiDAR, John Hagan, a leading ecologist in Maine, determined that the tree canopy over nearly 80% of the area is less than 35 feet tall and only 7% of the area has trees greater than 50 feet tall.

“The biggest problem with the NECEC proposal is that the 50,000 acres that NECEC selected contains almost no mature forest as typically recognized by both forest and wildlife ecologists – a fundamental requirement for the mitigation plan,” Sally Stockwell, then director of conservation for Maine Audubon, said in a Thursday news release.

But regulators said this week that the proposed land had enough “conservation value” to meet its standards. The DEP cited direct connections to 400,000 acres of conserved land, a lack of specific definitions for mature forest.

Opposition to the NECEC project is not new.

In 2021, Maine voters approved a referendum backed by environmental advocates to kill the project by making such transmission lines subject to approval by the state Legislature.

Combined, the sides spent more than $100 million during the campaign — setting a new spending record for a ballot question in Maine.

Years of legal challenges ensued.

First, CMP challenged the referendum itself, arguing retroactive application was unconstitutional and violated its due process and vested rights. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court agreed and allowed the project to move forward.

Then, environmental groups challenged a lease of about a mile of public land for the project, saying it constituted a substantial change to the land and therefore required a two-thirds majority of the Legislature. Maine’s high court again sided with Avangrid and allowed the lease.

Environmental groups also sued federal permitters over their environmental analysis of the transmission line. That challenge was rejected in April.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

With the final hurdle cleared, CMP plans to complete construction, testing and commissioning in the next month and a half.

The line is expected to begin operating by the end of the year.

CMP claims the project will lower energy costs for consumers in Maine by more than $14 million per year, and by more than $150 million in Massachusetts — where most of the energy will end up.

Environmental groups expressed concerns that Wednesday’s approval will set a dangerous precedent for future developments. The DEP’s decision to use specific species as indicators and adopt the “shifting mosaic” approach will harm species that need mature forests not just along this corridor, but in other areas, too, the groups said.

“For one of the highest-profile development projects in years, the DEP is saying for the purposes of compliance for this project — and this project only — we will define ‘mature forest habitat’ in a way that future regulators can ignore,” said Luke Frankel, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “This is not the way a state regulatory agency should operate. The way to avoid bad precedent is simple: don’t set it.”",https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/20211130_necec_20-1658353634.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-11-21 16:01:48.667526

The ""People's Transition Team,"" an initiative of the nonprofit Together New Orleans, will focus on four issue areas identified by city residents the group surveyed — cost of living, public works, jobs and energy.

Over the next two months before elected officials’ Jan. 12 inauguration, the organization will develop a plan for those officials to tackle the issues in their first 100 days in office.

In April, Together New Orleans plans to publish a report card, grading the mayor-elect and council members on their performance. The group said it has raised the funds needed to mail the report card to 50,000 registered voters.

At a press conference outside City Hall on Thursday, Shawn Anglim, a pastor at First Grace United Methodist Church and leader with Together New Orleans, said the old-fashioned approach, ""where you go cast a ballot, and then you go sit in the bleacher seats and you either boo or cheer your elected officials,"" hasn't worked.

""Together New Orleans has a second approach,"" he said. ""You gather 50-plus faith, unions, civic institutions deeply rooted in the city they love, and they get very, very clear about what they want to see change.""

The People’s Transition effort is a part of a broader push by Together New Orleans and its member institutions to ""do democracy differently"" and take on a more assertive role in shaping local government.

Its kick-off caps work that began in March 2024, when the organization’s delegates agreed to start a listening campaign to figure out the most pressing issues facing the city's residents. More than 1,500 people participated in small group meetings, and the organization eventually settled on the four focus areas.

In the coming months, four teams focused on the issue areas will develop a plan to teach the public about various problems and potential solutions. The teams will present the plan at various congregations, unions, schools and neighborhood groups next year.

The transition also plans to meet with subject matter experts to figure out what steps newly elected leaders can take in their first 100 days. They will then develop benchmarks that will form the basis of the scorecard.

""We asked one very important question: what is one thing our city needs to change?"" said Katie Jacob, a pastor at Grace Lutheran Church.

The work also comes after the group’s delegates in July ratified a ""People's Platform."" At an assembly in September, Moreno and six of the seven incoming council members vowed to support the platform. (Councilmember Lesli Harris, who ran unopposed, didn't attend the assembly.)

The platform calls for banning traffic camera tickets, rapidly fixing potholes, and paying city contractor invoices quickly, among other changes.

It also calls for the passage of a proposal pending before the city council to use $30 million from a settlement with Entergy to create battery-powered networks, or ""microgrids,"" across the city that would equip homes, small businesses, churches and other institutions with battery power walls. The proposal has faced opposition from Entergy, which argues the money would be better spent on its own resiliency programs.

Moreno, at a press conference Thursday, said she couldn't remember off the top of her head every aspect of Together New Orleans' platform, but that she ""fully supports"" Together New Orleans' microgrid proposal. The council is expected to vote on the proposal at a Dec. 10 committee meeting.

""One of the promises I made is that I would get this done before the end of my term,"" Moreno, who currently serves as council vice president, said. ""This is really transformative. It's a new, out of the box way of thinking. We would be leading on this climate initiative.""

Moreno gave an update on her own transition efforts on Thursday at New Orleans East Hospital, ahead of meeting of a transition committee focused on policy issues affecting New Orleans East and the Lower 9th Ward.

The mayor-elect said she wants to focus on retaining existing businesses — with dedicated personnel at City Hall to help address issues like utility bills and illegal dumping — while also pushing to recruit new businesses to the area.

She said her team is trying to ""untangle"" legal issues to help spur the redevelopment of the former Lake Forest Plaza site and that she wants the city to sell blighted property on Old Gentilly Road that once housed an incinerator.

Finally, she said she wants the redevelopment of the Six Flags site ""to move a lot faster,"" and that her administration plans to continue the work of the stalled New Orleans East Renaissance Plan, which Mayor LaToya Cantrell's administration put the brakes on earlier this year, by folding it into another ongoing study.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/46/146a0b2c-73cc-551c-a96b-793bb2117ddf/67f7ff05b4df0.image.jpg?crop=1779%2C934%2C0%2C115&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-21 14:01:48.184988

In this case, OpenAI is teaming with Oracle and Related Digital on a 1GW data centre campus, Prevalon is teaming up with Emerson to provide data centre support, and EPC Power will provide ON.energy with power converters supporting data centre development.

OpenAI, Oracle, and Related Digital planning 1GWh data centre campus in Michigan

AI company, OpenAI, technology company Oracle, and data centre development firm Related Digital have announced plans to develop a data centre campus with over 1GW of capacity in Saline Township, Michigan.

The multi-billion-dollar investment in the project, expected to start construction in early 2026, is part of the previously announced partnership between OpenAI and Oracle to deliver an additional 4.5GW of Stargate capacity.

Michigan real estate office, The Perna Team, wrote of the project, “With over 1GW of computing capacity, the complex will draw an estimated 1.4GW of electricity at full tilt. Utility DTE Energy notes this is about 25% of its entire current power generation capacity, roughly equivalent to the output of a mid-sized nuclear reactor.”

This project has been dubbed The Barn, after a historic red barn on the site of the project.

The companies state that The Barn, financed by a group of prominent private investors and financial institutions, is expected to generate more than 2,500 union construction jobs.

Ongoing, Related Digital and Oracle expect to create more than 450 jobs onsite collectively, as well as 1,500 jobs county-wide, to support the project, along with thousands of indirect jobs across Michigan and the US.

The data centre campus will utilise a closed-loop cooling system, which Related Digital claims limits daily water use to levels comparable to an office building.

Utility DTE Energy is supplying 100% of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment, financed entirely by the project, in a way that “ensures no impact on DTE’s existing customers’ energy supply or rates.”

DTE further claims that its customers will benefit from the project, contributing its share to the fixed costs of maintaining and improving the grid.

Pending approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), The Barn will consist of three 550,000 square-foot single-story buildings. It will be LEED certified.

Prevalon Energy partners with Emerson to support data centres

Dedicated BESS spin-out of Mitsubishi Power Americas, Prevalon Energy, and software and engineering firm Emerson are partnering to support hyperscale, colocation, and enterprise data centres.

The collaboration brings together Prevalon’s HD5 energy storage platform and insightOS energy management system (EMS) with Emerson’s Ovation automation platform.

Speaking with ESN Premium shortly after announcing insightOS, Prevalon’s president and CEO, Thomas Cornell, said:

“There’s a lot of buzz words — a lot of these control systems, they all share a lot of the same features, functions and benefits. But I think the things that really make our system stand out, and when I talk to our controls engineers, the number one thing they say, is that it works. It’s a very robust system, and it works.”

Through this teaming agreement, Prevalon and Emerson will collaborate to seek opportunities for integrating advanced control, automation, and energy storage systems for data center clients globally.

The companies will align their marketing, development, and customer engagement efforts to promote the adoption of new technologies in data center applications.

Cornell has also discussed Prevalon’s data centre ambitions in another interview with ESN Premium in September.

“They’re very large projects with different use cases for the batteries. The batteries on those are going to be anywhere from probably 500MW to 600MW with a two-hour duration.”

He continued, “The gas turbines are going to be at base load, so they’ll be fixed, but the data centre load swings based on the level of computing that’s going on, and the batteries are going to be there to pick up and match the load.”

In June, Prevalon’s 80MW/320MWh Happy Valley BESS entered commercial operations at utility Idaho Power’s Happy Valley battery storage project.

Earlier this year, the company signed a contract with Idaho Power for a 200MW/800MWh BESS. The agreement details long-term maintenance and remote monitoring services, with deployment scheduled for 2026.

EPC Power and ON.Energy partnering on grid-safe AI infrastructure

Manufacturer of power conversion systems EPC Power, and system integrator and project developer, ON.energy, have announced a strategic partnership seeing EPC supplying ON with power converters.

ON.energy will incorporate EPC Power’s hardware into its ‘AI UPS’ platform, capable of scaling from MWs to GWs and supporting runtimes of up to 8 hours.

EPC states that AI UPS is designed for hyperscale AI computing, safeguarding both grid-connected and off-grid systems by absorbing rapid AI transients and load fluctuations, while providing voltage and frequency ride-through capabilities that help speed up interconnection processes.

ON.energy began its journey in Latin America, specifically in the commercial and industrial (C&I) energy storage market, and has since expanded into the US, focusing on distributed and utility-scale portfolios.

ON.energy functions through two main business models. The first is as a system integrator and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC, not to be confused with the EPC Power) contractor, providing solutions to generators, third-party developers, and large corporations. Its primary focus is on C&I projects for critical infrastructure and data centres across six Latin American countries and Texas in the US.

The second is in leveraging its system integrator and EPC capabilities for its own project portfolios, which the company develops, builds, owns and operates in select US markets, predominantly for front-of-the-meter applications.

In January, ON.energy closed a US$77.6 million construction credit agreement with Pathward, NA and BridgePeak Energy Capital to build its 160MWh Palo de Agua BESS portfolio.

The portfolio, planned for development across Texas, encompasses the Poplar, Ft. Stockton, Mesquite, North Pecos, Colorado, Colorado 1, Andrews, Fathead 1, Fathead 2, and Badger BESS projects. All these BESS projects are anticipated to become operational sometime this year, each with a capacity of 9.9MW/20MWh.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prevalon-emerson-pr-image2-en-gb-12034298.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:47.000637

That’s helped me in my term of student body president and at both of my internships,” he said.","Adolfo Alvarez ’26 went from not knowing if he was going to attend college to becoming UNC-Chapel Hill’s 2025-26 student body president.

As the University’s first Latino student body president, Alvarez embraces the challenge of representing his peers, bridging connections across campus and leadership, and ensuring that every student feels heard.

“I represent 32,000 people,” he said. “Serving as president gives me the chance to show up for students, to listen and to learn from them. I believe we’re stronger when we bring different perspectives together.”

Alvarez grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, and moved by himself to the United States when he was 16. As a high school senior, he lived alone and worked overtime at a QuikTrip gas station in Arizona to make ends meet.

At Carolina, Alvarez received a Carolina Covenant and a Wachovia Chancellor’s scholarships.

“I didn’t have much in the United States at the time; it was just me,” Alvarez said. “Carolina offered to pay for my education and had it all figured out for me. Carolina gave me everything.”

Alvarez is double-majoring in media and journalism at UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media and in global studies in the UNC College of Arts and Sciences. He has had summer internships with IHG Hotels and Resorts in Atlanta and the OneCarolina Summer Internship Program, where he got real-life experience in university development.

“In Hussman, we learn how to articulate things, how to communicate mass messaging and also balance the audiences you’re working with. That’s helped me in my term of student body president and at both of my internships,” he said. “Communication is such an important component of being in leadership.”

Since taking office, he has worked to improve communication between University administration and students. At the same time, he’s helping launch efforts like the Carolina Closet, a project to provide students with free access to professional attire for interviews, internships and job opportunities.

“By working with donors and campus partners, I hope to establish the Carolina Closet as a permanent resource, similar to a food pantry but focused on formal wear,” he said.

Since election night, Alvarez’s life catapulted into a state of constant busyness that he’s never experienced before. But he’s not fazed by it; he’s grateful.

“My life has changed a lot,” he said. “You go from being just a student to being a text away from the chancellor and serving on the UNC Board of Trustees and speaking at convocation and being on the stage at graduation. It’s such a privilege to represent so many people, and I’m genuinely excited because it gives me a reason to talk to everyone. If I see a random event on campus, even if I’m not sure I’m invited, I’ll show up and say, ‘Hey, everyone!’”

For Alvarez, serving as student body president isn’t just leadership, it’s gratitude in action, a way to honor the University that changed his life by devoting himself fully to the students he now represents.

“I always knew that I wanted to pay back everything the University gave me,” he said. “I came from an environment of uncertainty, and UNC only wanted me to worry about succeeding. I don’t see a better way to give back than representing the people, giving my energy and devoting my time to students. This opportunity is so full circle and exactly what I was hoping for, to give back to Carolina.”",https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Adolfo_Hero-1.png,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:55.865703

With ARAQYS, Dcubed is positioning itself as the category leader in delivering affordable, scalable, and unlimited energy in orbit.

After SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and others transformed access to space through lower launch costs and increased capacity, a new generation of in-orbit applications — from data centers, high delta v transportation and direct-to-device communications to defense constellations — has emerged. Each shares a common challenge: a massive demand for affordable, scalable power.

ARAQYS addresses this by providing a full spectrum of space power solutions — from traditional deployable solar arrays to their proprietary in-space-manufactured KW solar array subsystems, and ultimately to Space Power Plants capable of beaming energy wherever it’s needed. This technology aims to dramatically reduce the cost per kilowatt, laying the groundwork for space infrastructure and directed-energy platforms of the future.

“Dcubed is fully committed to leading the next frontier: power generation in orbit,” said Dr. Thomas Sinn, CEO of Dcubed. “My involvement in a NASA NIAC study on space- based solar power more than 15 years ago set this journey in motion. Since then, we’ve been steadily developing the technologies required to make in-space energy a practical reality. With ARAQYS, we’re now combining those years of innovation into affordable large scale power solutions designed to meet the demands of the rapidly growing space economy.“

As the next step toward this vision, Dcubed announced the ARAQYS-D3 mission, which is manifested for launch in Q1 2027 aboard a SpaceX Rideshare mission. This mission will demonstrate a 2kW in-space-manufactured solar array with combined application cases in power-beaming and directed energy as well as demonstrating EP enabled high delta-v capabilities.

Collaboration between these European and American teams results in the ARAQYS-D3 satellite to be built by Astro Digital and Dcubed. This venture symbolizes transatlantic cooperation in advancing the next era of space systems. Astro Digital, a heritage spacecraft bus provider is located just a few miles from Dcubed’s American headquarters in Berthoud, Colorado.

The launch of ARAQYS-D3 is brokered by Maverick Space Systems, who will also provide launch management and integration services for the satellite. Maverick’s support will help Dcubed streamline the launch process, reduce risk, and allow us to focus on the ARAQYS-D3 mission.

“We’re excited to partner with Dcubed on this groundbreaking mission,” said Chris Biddy, CEO of Astro Digital. “The Araqys-D3 satellite will demonstrate how in-space manufacturing and large scale economic power generation can unlock a new class of small satellites—capable of generating, storing, and transmitting the energy required for the next generation of orbital missions.”

“We’re grateful to be supporting the launch of the ARAQYS-D3 mission,” said Roland Coelho, CEO of Maverick Space. “We see this as just the beginning of a close collaboration with Dcubed on future projects and developments.“

Dr. Sinn added: “It’s an honor to partner with Astro Digital and Maverick. This collaboration brings Europe and the United States closer together, uniting two space ecosystems to shape the future of satellite design and space power delivery.”

The production of the ARAQYS-D3 spacecraft and the ISM solar array will be conducted across Dcubed’s facilities in Munich, Germany, and Berthoud, Colorado, demonstrating the company’s bi-continental production capability and readiness for megawatt-scale manufacturing. The launch integration will be carried out by Maverick Space Systems form San Luis Obispo, California.

Paving the Way: ARAQYS-D1 and ARAQYS-D2

ARAQYS-D3 builds on two precursor missions that are already integrated and ready for launch on two separate SpaceX rideshare missions in Q1 2026:

Dcubed-1 (internally known as ARAQYS-D1) “BOOM! THERE IT IS”, a 3U satellite that will manufacture a 60 cm ISM boom directly in free space.

ARAQYS-D2 “WATTS NEW IN SPACE”, which will print and deploy a 1 m-long ISM solar array aboard Exotrail’s next SpaceVan mission.

These demonstrations will validate the building blocks of in-space power generation, paving the way for ARAQYS-D3’s multi-kilowatt-class system.

Dcubed is determining it’s next step after seven years of building capabilities and delivering over 1,500 flight-proven products to more than 120 customers across four continents, Dcubed is leveraging its deep heritage in deployable mechanisms to power the next phase of orbital industrialization.

Despite this year-over-year increase, Rhode Island has achieved a 19.5% reduction in emissions since 1990.
Continued progress on emissions requires coordination across states, federal agencies, utilities, and private industry.
The law requires Rhode Island achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and sets interim benchmarks for 2030 and 2040.
A detailed summary of the 2023 findings, including data sources is available in the 2023 Rhode Island Greenhouse Gas Inventory summary report at https://dem.ri.gov/ghg-inventory.","PROVIDENCE, RI – The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) announces a slight increase in the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2023. Statewide emissions rose to 9.52 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e), a 1.4% uptick compared to 2022. Despite this year-over-year increase, Rhode Island has achieved a 19.5% reduction in emissions since 1990. Continued progress on emissions requires coordination across states, federal agencies, utilities, and private industry.

The results come from DEM’s annual assessment of the state’s GHG emissions, the primary scientific tool used by the EC4 to track progress under the 2021 Act on Climate. The law requires Rhode Island achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and sets interim benchmarks for 2030 and 2040.

Notably, recent federal actions – including HR1 and related regulatory rollbacks that have drastically reduced federal funding for state and local energy programs and altered national clean-energy incentives – may affect the pace at which states can reasonably advance toward their climate goals.

As in past years, transportation (37%), residential buildings (19.6%), and electricity consumption (19.3%) were the state’s largest emission sources. A 5.1% jump in transportation emissions from 2022 levels, reflecting national trends of rising vehicle miles traveled, drove most of the overall increase.

Emissions from electricity-use were unchanged, because the electricity Rhode Island received from ISO New England was more carbon intense than in 2022. Residential building emissions declined 2.4% and commercial building emissions declined 5.3% from 2022 levels. 2023 marks the third consecutive year that residential and commercial building emissions have declined.

“This inventory provides a valuable scientific foundation for understanding where we stand,” said Governor Dan McKee. “As we look at the clean-energy landscape in 2025 and beyond, it’s undeniable that actions taken by the Trump Administration will fundamentally disrupt states’ long-term climate plans. The Trump administration’s rollback of clean-energy initiatives and its cuts to billions of dollars in funding have intentionally undermined the clean-energy future for states across the nation. As federal policies continue to shift, we will keep working with our partners to chart a practical and responsible path forward on reducing emissions.”

“Although the increase in emissions is disappointing, the rise in transportation emissions in 2023 follows national trends,” said DEM Director Terry Gray. “Despite the changing federal landscape – including reductions in federal clean-energy funding and the reversal of certain national clean-car and clean-energy standards – reducing our greenhouse gas emissions continues to be a priority across the EC4 agencies.”

Over the past five years, 2023 emissions decreased 5.4% below 2018 levels. Since 1990, transportation, residential buildings, and electricity consumption fell by 14%, 14.2%, and 30.6%. To meet the Act on Climate’s 2030 target (45% below 1990), Rhode Island must cut another 3.02 MMTCO2e (average of 4.5% per year) over the next seven years.

While federal policy changes in the OBBBA presented challenges to the industry, solar has proven to be one of the most cost-competitive sources of electricity, and is here to stay, the study finds.

IREC reports that the National Solar Jobs Census is based on a survey administered to tens of thousands of energy firms in 2024 and therefore does not reflect impacts of the OBBBA on the solar industry. Which was reported to have led to cancellation of over $6.7 billion in projects in June 2025 alone.

States with notable increases in job numbers occurred in what the report calls “Republican-leaning ‘red’ states: Ohio (5%), Georgia (4.5%), Utah (3.5%), and Texas (3%). See the state-specific solar employment numbers in IREC’s interactive map.

The expansion of battery energy storage was found to contribute to “significant job growth,” increasing 4% in 2024 and 17% in the five-year period between 2019 and 2024.

The census found that there are approximately 280,119 employed in the solar industry who focus primarily on solar, up slightly from the 2023 figure of 279,447. If you add in those who serve other industries as well, the number rises to over 370,000, IREC reports. Additionally it found that over 93,000 people focus primarily on battery energy storage, bringing the total to over 464,000 in solar and storage in 2024.

IREC concluded that he solar industry accounts for more jobs than any clean energy industry other than energy efficiency and employs more than three times more than the coal industry.

The Solar Jobs Census finds that the majority of people employed in solar are in the installation sector (64%). This sector includes construction workers and electricians, along with many other supporting roles, such sales, marketing, software, management, and

finance. With incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for domestic manufacturing, the U.S. has seen strong growth in that sector; however, the manufacturing job number of 32, 491 does not reflect the strong growth because few new facilities were fully online by the end of the year.

The IREC report points to an estimate by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) that anticipates that if all the announced solar and storage facilities came online, manufacturing jobs will rise to 75,000 by the end of the decade. Analysts expect that domestic manufacturing will stall in future years with some facilities closing or being sold, due to changes in federal legislation under the Trump administration, the report notes.

Looking ahead

Growth in solar deployment skyrocketed In 2024, with the U.S. installing 50 GW of new solar capacity, which IREC notes is more than double the capacity installed two years before and nearly four times the amount in 2019. Jobs, however, have not increased by the same factor due to increased efficiency. For example, the report states that between 2010 and 2019, solar jobs increased by 167% with more than 150,000 jobs added. Then, in the five-year period between 2019 and 2024, solar jobs grew by 12% while installed solar capacity increased by 286%. The report attributes increased efficiency to larger installations as well as new technologies including digital scheduling tools, remote monitoring, modular components, and the recent launch of robots and AI.

In 2025, the Trump Administration and new Congress scaled back support for solar and other renewables in favor of fossil fuels, which the report expects to further discourage solar deployment. All is not lost; however, as IREC notes that the many benefits of solar and demand for excessive energy generation will keep solar competitive with other energy sources. The rush to install projects before tax credits expire will buoy the industry in the near term, and the report points to analyst estimates that solar deployment could be reduced by over 20% compared to projected growth before the legislation was enacted.

The report concludes that solar jobs numbers will remain steady in 2025 and jobs “will likely keep increasing in emerging industries like battery storage as well as in energy efficiency fields.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Fig-2-Segment.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:02:30.597725

The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal.
“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.

Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act.","Wyoming’s congressional delegation this week celebrated a major step toward invalidating the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming — home to one of the largest coal deposits and the most productive coal mines in North America.

But whether the effort will result in any new, major coal leases in the region is in doubt, and the congressional method to overturn the ban has infuriated conservation groups across the West who say it’s part of a larger GOP effort to upend decades of careful compromise to achieve “multiple use” on public lands.

Joint Resolution 130, introduced in October by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, passed the U.S. House and Senate this week. The measure would overturn the ban by employing the rarely used Congressional Review Act to invalidate the BLM’s Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan, which was updated in December.

Under the Biden administration, the BLM suggested the ban would have little impact on the flagging industry, which primarily provides fuel to the nation’s aging fleet of coal-fired power plants, noting coal mines in the region already have legal access to enough reserves to continue mining at the same pace beyond 2040.

But both Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation and the Trump administration have pointed to unprecedented electrical demands for artificial intelligence and other data computations.

“The Biden administration’s relentless war on American energy was waged at every level, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, where it halted coal leasing,” Hageman wrote Tuesday on the social media platform X. “Passing H.J. Res. 130 will restore our national energy dominance, protect Wyoming jobs and prosperity and reassert Congress’s authority over an unchecked administrative state.”

Despite a bullish outlook and moderate upticks for the industry in recent months, a test run to resume leasing federal coal in the Powder River Basin failed — some say spectacularly — in October. The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal. Days later, the agency indefinitely postponed another coal lease auction on the Wyoming side of the basin.

“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.

Huskinson worked for decades as a Powder River Basin coal miner in Wyoming and serves as chair of the Sheridan-based landowner advocacy group Powder River Basin Resource Council. The $186,000 bid that Navajo Transitional Energy Company offered for the 167 million-ton federal coal tract in Montana was so low that it might not have even covered “a big repair on one of their motor graders,” she asserted.

Congress is using the CRA to override previously approved management plans elsewhere in the West. Because these plans are shaped by a formal public comment process, conservation groups say overriding them flies in the face of local input about how to best manage America’s public lands. It may even invalidate other uses permitted under BLM resource management plans, such as grazing and oil and gas leases, some conservation groups say.

“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple-use is hard,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a statement Thursday. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists and small-business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.”

Gov. Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act.

“When signed by the President, this action ensures that no future federal administration can authorize the large-scale termination of coal leasing in the area,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/coal-haul-trucks-belle-ayr-2025-dbleizeffer1763739875.jpeg?h=9a1378d6&itok=FG-iaTOs,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:40.911929

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.” “Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.
Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.","WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as “federal public benefits,” which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify.

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a ” whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump’s broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”

The final regulation is expected to apply beginning in tax year 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that “we are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.” Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said.

Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said since people without work authorization already don’t qualify for these refundable tax credits, “the folks who are really going to be impacted are people who are really trying to do the right thing, the people authorized to work and paying their taxes.”

He said he believed the administration was trying to make the lives of taxpaying immigrants more difficult.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.”

“Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.

Davis said there probably wouldn’t be majority support for the move in Congress, which he said probably prompted the administration to act unilaterally on the issue instead.

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman pushed back against Republicans’ so-called SPEED Act, a sweeping bill that would gut core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and rig the rules to fast-track polluter projects and silence Americans. Democratic members offered a series of amendments to the legislation that would lower costs, improve public health, support community input, prevent polluter handouts, and stop Trump’s attacks on cheap, clean energy sources.

Excerpts and Highlights from Ranking Member Huffman’s Opening Remarks

“American families are struggling right now to make ends meet. Trump's tariffs have raised prices on everything. Millions of Americans are about to lose affordable health care because Republicans don't have a plan to fix the crisis that they set in motion. The last thing our constituents need right now is higher utility bills because President Trump wants to stop new transmission lines and shut down an entire sector of clean energy that can help us deliver cheap, affordable electricity.”

""While the House was out of session this fall, Democrats met with companies and organizations across the spectrum to discuss this legislation. [And] across these conversations, there was agreement that NEPA provides important benefits: benefits that force the federal government to take a hard look and carefully consider alternatives and impacts, benefits that provide transparency, benefits that provide community input and engagement. These are important pillars of NEPA that, unfortunately, are undermined in deeply disturbing ways by the legislation before us today.""

“[T]he SPEED Act [treats] environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes. Weakening environmental review won't fix permitting challenges. It certainly won't help us build the clean energy future that we need. Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

War on Clean Energy

“Wind and solar projects across this country are being shut down by this administration with the approval of Congressional Republicans. We can't ignore that. It is an essential part of the context for any serious conversation in this space. Now, if President Trump and Secretary Burgum weren't illegally blocking wind and solar projects right now, firing permitting staff, cutting funding for agencies – we'd be having a very different conversation about permitting legislation.”

""Donald Trump is not always right, as you have watched him be terribly wrong on the Epstein files, as you've watched him be terribly wrong on redistricting and this race to the bottom that he set in motion. He's not always right. And so, I'm going to urge my colleagues across the aisle to summon your independence, summon a little bit of courage once again this week, and push back on this president when he is terribly wrong – and he is terribly wrong on clean energy right now.”

“This bill is so extreme that there's simply nothing left in a meaningful way of NEPA if this were to become law. Now, Democrats are very interested in working constructively in problem solving. We would love to have a meaningful conversation, but it has to start with ending the war on clean energy, which this bill does not do in any significant way.”

“The promise of American leadership in the green economy is being squandered. In effect, as China dominates the industries and jobs of tomorrow, we're locking ourselves into a fossil fuel stalemate when we should be taking advantage of the clean energy revolution. I will continue to say this: we can't have a real conversation about permitting reform until these attacks stop.”

“Over the past few months, the Department of Energy has terminated $7.6 billion in clean energy awards. Reports show that nearly $23 billion more is on the chopping block right now. Projects that would lower energy costs, strengthen the grid, and provide thousands of jobs. These are straightforward, beneficial investments that serve only to benefit the average American, and there is no rational explanation for targeting them. The only people benefiting are Big Oil billionaires.”

Public Health and Community Input

“This bill would prevent agencies from examining harms that communities across the country are living with right now. So, consider the poster child here: Louisiana's Cancer Alley, where predominantly black neighborhoods face some of the highest pollution related cancer risks in the nation. Those risks result from cumulative emissions from many facilities over decades, impacts that are well documented and directly tied to federal permitting decisions. And under this bill, agencies would be prohibited from considering those cumulative effects because they unfold over time and across multiple sources. That's not streamlining. That's telling federal agencies to look the other way in the face of an obviously foreseeable harm.""

""Agencies would be limited to analyzing only the alternatives that meet the applicant's preferred outcomes, and reasonable alternatives that would reduce environmental harm, lower costs, avoid impacts to communities, or better serve the public's interest, are excluded entirely by law. That is not reform. That is enabling biased analysis from the start. That is a thumb on the scale against the public.""

""This is an extreme and radical bill. [It’s] just chock full of these things that create an impossible gauntlet for people who are really hurt by bad projects and even illegal projects, from having any chance to challenge them. That is not an honest process. That is not a fine-tuning of NEPA. It's a dramatic, radical change to a law that protects the public.”

“[The] problem is the way the bill goes way too far in constraining environmental reviews, in eliminating, in some cases, transparency and public input. And we don't have to wonder what it looks like when you take away transparency, when you take away public input, when you make it impossible to stop a wrongheaded project that the federal government just decides to do, even if it's illegal, even if it's a crazy idea, when you make it impossible to scrutinize or stop that. We have a perfect example, and it is the East Wing of the White House right here. This is what happens when there's no transparency, when there's no scrutiny, when there's no input, when there's no way to stop a dumb idea from moving forward because you've done something like this to the NEPA process.”

Key Democratic Amendments

Huffman amendment #3 to prevent the bill from taking effect until clean energy grants such as offshore wind port grants that have been improperly rescinded by the Trump administration are reinstated and regulations are in place to prevent similar actions in the future.

Magaziner amendment #6 to clarify that renewable projects are recognized as legitimate multiple-use activities, planned responsibly, reviewed transparently, and coordinated with Tribes, states, fishermen, and local communities.

Ansari amendment #9 to amend the bill’s restrictions on the consideration of new science during much of the environmental review period. This amendment protects communities that would otherwise be put in harm’s way because an agency was forced to ignore new science about flooding, wildfire, pollution, or habitat collapse.

Rivas amendment #11 to ensure that NEPA’s public participation process is accessible and meets the needs of the community so people can have a voice in the decisions that affect their health, safety, and environment.

Rivas amendment #12 to add renewable energy to the list of national policies for the White House Council on Environmental Quality to foster and support.

Huffman amendment #13 to strike the provisions of the bill that dramatically narrows the definition of a “major Federal action” to exempt numerous projects from NEPA review and allow federal agencies to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on major infrastructure, energy, and environmental projects with no environmental review, no public input, and no accountability.

Grijalva amendment #14 to ensure that climate and environmental justice are included as national priorities pursued by the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

Min amendment #17 to repeal the Department of the Interior’s memo forcing all wind and solar energy projects through a permitting process that requires personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum at every stage of the permitting process, needlessly adding red tape to stall clean, affordable energy development.

Randall amendment #20 to exempt tribes from the bill’s restrictions that prevent them from getting judicial review, protecting their ability to challenge agency decisions that affect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and treaty obligations.

Randall amendment #22 to ensures that offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated by President Trump’s Big Ugly Bill still go through NEPA review.

Brownley amendment #24 to preserve meaningful accountability and ensure agencies correct significant errors before projects move forward.

Huffman amendment #26 to strike the provision that would prohibit agencies from considering cumulative effects of projects and foreseeable harm like pollution-related cancer risks.

Huffman amendment #28 to amend the judicial review section of the bill to ensure that federal agencies follow the law, listen to communities, and carefully consider the environmental and public-health consequences of their decisions.

What the So-Called SPEED Act Would Do

The SPEED Act would dramatically limit what federal agencies are allowed to consider when evaluating the environmental and public health consequences of major proposed projects, including climate and environmental justice impacts.

Bans the use of new scientific research or updated data that becomes available after a project is proposed—forcing agencies to ignore improved wildfire maps, updated climate models, or newly available health risk assessments.

Greatly limits what projects and actions can be reviewed under NEPA.

Limits public input and legal recourse to make it virtually impossible for communities to raise legitimate concerns or challenge flawed environmental reviews in court.

Tilts the standard for legal challenges even further away from impacted communities towards polluters while greatly limiting the ability of courts to take corrective action or provide relief.

Bipartisan Governor Letter Calls on Congress to Overhaul Energy Permitting

Thirteen governors of the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) issued a letter calling on Congress to move quickly on permitting reform. Led by Kevin Stitt (OK) and Josh Shapiro (PA), the governors warn that the U.S. risks falling behind countries like China if developers can’t build new infrastructure fast enough to meet rising power demand.

Their pitch ties the issue to some of the country’s biggest challenges, including keeping up in the AI race, bringing down energy costs for consumers, and upgrading the grid to be more resilient in the face of extreme weather. The governors argue that outdated approval processes are slowing down pipeline and transmission projects that could make energy more affordable and reliable.

A major part of their proposal centers on updating the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to study the environmental impacts of major projects before giving them the green light. Among the changes they’re suggesting is a cut to NEPA’s statute of limitations for lawsuits challenging agency decisions from six years to one year or less.

The bipartisan coalition is also calling for more authority for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, which are high-priority routes for expanding the electric grid and connecting new sources of clean energy.

News and Updates

California Stepping Up to Meet Emissions Cut Goals

California regulators are weighing big changes to the state’s carbon market to make polluting more expensive for companies and accelerate its progress towards climate goals. The California Air Resources Board, which runs the nation’s largest carbon market, is considering stricter rules, such as reducing the number of pollution allowances and cutting back on free permits for certain industries. These changes would raise costs for emitters and encourage cleaner practices.

The move supports California’s goal to cut emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2045. A new law signed this year also extended the carbon market’s lifespan to 2045, ensuring it remains a key tool in reducing California’s carbon footprint.

Exxon Lawsuit Challenges Climate Disclosure Update

As California is tightening pressure on big polluters, Exxon Mobil is suing the state, asserting that reporting requirements unfairly target fossil fuel producers and violate the First Amendment.

California’s new climate disclosure laws, known as S.B. 253 and S.B. 261, will require corporations with over $1 billion in revenue to disclose their supply-chain emissions starting in 2026. Those making over $500 million will also be required to biennially report financial risks tied to climate change, including impacts from climate-related natural disasters on business operations, financial standing, and investments.

Business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed similar lawsuits last year. A federal judge has refused to block the laws noting “plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on [their] merits” tied to the First Amendment, but this case is currently on appeal in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

What they’re saying: “November’s results reflect another notable—yet anticipated—decline in the new-vehicle sales pace, driven largely by the pull-ahead of electric vehicle (EV) purchases prior to the expiration of federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30,” said Thomas King, president of OEM solutions at J.D. Power.

“That expiration prompted many shoppers to accelerate buying decisions, resulting in a surge in EV sales that temporarily inflated the overall industry sales pace,” he added.

Why it matters: The slowdown reflects a timing shift from the EV pull-ahead, not a demand collapse, leaving dealers with tougher year-over-year comps and a cooler sales pace. Stores will need to lean into the right mix (ICE, hybrids, value models), tighter inventory discipline, and creative deal structures to protect volume and profitability.

Between the lines: With the EV rush and federal incentives in the rearview, the average manufacturer incentive spend was higher than October but still lower than a year ago—as more sales shift toward internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, with trucks and SUVs driving transactions.

The average OEM incentive spend per vehicle is on track to reach $3,211, up $375 from October—but $125 lower than a year ago.

Leasing is expected to decline 2.7 percentage points from November 2024, reaching 20.5% of total sales, while leases still account for 54% of EV transactions.

ICE vehicles are projected to account for 77.5% of new retail sales, up 2.3 percentage points from a year ago—while EVs are expected to account for 6.0% of sales, down 3.6 percentage points.

Trucks and SUVs are on track to account for 82.6% of new-vehicle retail sales, up 1.0 percentage point from November 2024.

Affordability continues to weigh on new-vehicle sales, with the average new retail transaction price at $46,029, up $722 year-over-year, and the average monthly payment surging to $760—a record for November.

Bottom line: The easy lift from EV tax credits is gone, and the market is settling into a slower, more normal run rate where ICE trucks/SUVs and hybrids do the heavy lifting. Dealers are back to blocking-and-tackling—finding ways to move metal in a payment-stretched market without relying on outsized incentives or policy tailwinds.

“If there was ever a time the people of Louisiana needed to stand for something, it is now,” he said.
“They better wake up.” Representatives from 10 Louisiana parishes, including Allen, Calcasieu, Cameron and Vernon were in Baton Rouge on Thursday to support the filing of the lawsuit.","A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of state laws granting eminent domain power for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects has been filed against the State of Louisiana.

The 43-page suit was filed on Thursday in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish by Save My Louisiana, Inc., and several individual property owners, including Col. (Ret) Mark T. Guillory, Horace Johnson Jr., Louis Robertson, Pamela and Bradford Belgrad, Reggie Rice and David K. Woodham.

The defendants are the state of Louisiana. the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson, and Gov. Jeff Landry.

The plaintiffs are seeking to strike down the special laws granting eminent domain power to private companies and to cease all permitting and regulatory actions related to injection wells.

Save My Louisiana, a nonprofit advocacy group, contends that a series of special laws passed since 2020 violate citizens’ constitutional protections by granting private CCS companies the special privilege of eminent domain, allowing the expropriation of private property for private gain. The suit cites violations of multiple sections of the Louisiana Constitution.

“We hope to prove that our constitutional rights have been violated, and hope that the courts acknowledge that it has been violated,” said Mike Slocum, a member of Save My Louisiana, in a phone interview with the American Press. “We own our land, we have the right to liberty and property according to the Constitution, and that has been violated when you give industry the right to use eminent domain for private gain.”

Slocum noted the state has granted eminent domain rights to both foreign and domestic industry, which is a key concern.

“If there was ever a time the people of Louisiana needed to stand for something, it is now,” he said. “They better wake up.”

Representatives from 10 Louisiana parishes, including Allen, Calcasieu, Cameron and Vernon were in Baton Rouge on Thursday to support the filing of the lawsuit.

In a press release, Col. (Ret) Mark T. Guillory, of Save My Louisiana, stated, “We are petitioning the Judicial Branch to review these laws and establish that they are indeed in violation of the Constitution of Louisiana and that they be struck from the law thereby restoring Louisiana’s fundamental Right to Property.”

Guillory claims prior attempts to petition the legislative and executive branches to correct the “egregious and overt trampling of Constitutional guarantees and protections” were unsuccessful, noting that the authorization for the CCS industry to utilize eminent domain remains in full force under state law. specifically citing RS 10, Sec 2, paragraphed 10 and 11 and RS 30:1108, A I1.

He further criticized legislators for creating the situation, stating, “Legislators have offered excuses for this massive failure stating that they either didn’t read or understand the bills that created this situation yet still they voted for them.”

He said it was not until Save My Louisiana and others like it discovered the treachery of negligence that legislators began working to correct the situation. He added that the “anemic half-measures” offered to correct the situation seem to be “more like threading a needle to placate citizens with a false sense of security while protecting the carbon capture and sequestration industry’s right to exercise eminent domain.”

The plaintiffs also object to the governor’s executive order citing a “Landowner Bill of Rights for Geological Sequestration Projects” created by the same laws, arguing that new laws cannot make property taking less restrictive than the constitutional guarantees citizens already possess.

The lawsuit comes as over 33 applications for Class V test well and Class VI injection well projects have been permitted or are seeking final approval, with many located in Allen, Vernon and Rapides parishes.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/04/Carbon-capture.png,N,,2025-11-21 12:02:18.637260

According to new job listings for “Rental Readiness Specialists” spotted today, Tesla is launching rental operations in Austin, Nashville, Boston, Fort Worth, and Houston.

This marks the first major expansion of the program outside of its initial pilot locations in San Diego and Costa Mesa. By hiring its own fleet management staff, Tesla is bypassing traditional rental agencies like Hertz—who have notably pulled back on their EV ambitions—to control the entire customer experience directly.

The Deal: Undercutting the Competition

Tesla’s pricing structure is designed to undercut traditional rental counters while showcasing its high-margin software features. The confirmed pricing tiers for the new locations are:

Model 3 & Model Y: $60/day

Cybertruck: $75/day

Model S & Model X: $90/day

“Rent a Tesla and see how it makes every errand, commute, and road trip more fun,” the program’s landing page states.

But the real value lies in the perks, which effectively make this a subsidized test drive:

Unlimited Mileage: No caps on distance.

Free Supercharging: Fuel is completely on the house.

FSD (Supervised) Included: Renters get full access to Tesla’s $8,000 Full Self-Driving software.

Purchase Incentive: A $250 credit toward a new Tesla if you buy within 7 days of your rental.

The Strategy: A “Paid Test Drive”

This program is a direct response to the harsh reality of the post-tax credit market. Since the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025, automakers have scrambled to find new demand levers.

Tesla’s solution is to monetize its inventory while aggressively marketing its software. A standard 30-minute test drive rarely converts a skeptic, but a week-long rental with free charging and self-driving capabilities might. By offering the Cybertruck at just $75/day, Tesla is also turning its most polarizing vehicle into an accessible novelty for weekend trips, potentially broadening its appeal beyond early adopters.

EVXL’s Take

This expansion is a brilliant, if necessary, pivot. Tesla is solving three problems at once: moving stagnant inventory, generating service revenue, and collecting real-world data for its autonomy network.

Most importantly, this looks like the early infrastructure for the Tesla Network. As we reported during the “We, Robot” event in October 2024, Musk’s end-game is a fleet of autonomous Robotaxis. By building the logistics muscle now—hiring “Rental Readiness Specialists” to clean, charge, and manage a fleet—Tesla is quietly rehearsing for the day those cars rent themselves out without a driver.

Furthermore, this vertical integration mirrors the manufacturing efficiency analysts have praised. As noted in previous coverage of how Tesla could revolutionize U.S. manufacturing, Tesla’s ability to insource complex operations gives it a massive cost advantage. If Tesla can successfully run a national rental network, they aren’t just an automaker; they become the operator of the world’s largest distributed transportation utility.

Expect this program to launch in every major U.S. metro by Q1 2026. As traditional rental giants struggle with EV depreciation, Tesla will step in to own the entire vertical, eventually transitioning these “rental” fleets into the first wave of the Cybercab network.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8985-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 09:59:43.673047

Once completed, the project will generate enough clean, domestic electricity to power more than 24,000 homes, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2026.

Developed, owned, and operated by Arevon, the project represents nearly US$200 million in private investment and is Arevon’s first utility-scale solar development in the state. Formerly known as Campbell Solar, the project was renamed Big Muddy Solar in recognition of the river that flows through Jackson County, and its new logo features an outline of Murphysboro’s well-known Big Muddy Monster as a tribute to local identity and heritage.

The Big Muddy Solar Project will play an important role in meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable clean energy while also delivering long-term economic benefits to the region. Over its lifetime, the project is expected to generate more than US$12.6 million in property tax revenue, supporting local schools, public safety services, and community infrastructure.

Arevon has partnered with Signal Energy for construction, which will employ more than 250 workers, including members of local labor organizations such as IBEW Local 702, IUOE Local 318, and the Laborers’ International Union of North America Local 773. As construction continues, additional spending at local hotels, restaurants, shops, and service providers will further support the Jackson County economy. The project is backed by a long-term virtual power purchase agreement with an American multinational technology company.

Environmental stewardship is central to Arevon’s development approach, and Big Muddy Solar reflects this commitment. Alongside generating secure, homegrown renewable energy, the project will convert the land beneath and around its panels into a pollinator-friendly habitat, promoting healthy soil and supporting essential pollinator species. This dual-use approach enhances local biodiversity while ensuring responsible, sustainable project operations.

Arevon hosted a milestone event on November 18 to commemorate construction progress and recognize the company’s substantial investment in Jackson County’s energy future. The event brought together public officials, community leaders, business representatives, landowners, and other partners. Speakers included Arevon CEO Kevin Smith, Jackson County Board Chairman C.J. Calandro, Murphysboro Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Dawn McClerren, Regional Superintendent of Schools Matthew Hickam, Jackson Growth Alliance Chairman Brian Chapman, and Illinois State Police Special Agent Justin Haney, who also serves as Coordinator for the Team Illinois Youth Police Camp. Arevon Development Manager Jemma King served as the Master of Ceremonies.

Kevin Smith emphasized the project’s long-term value for the community, noting that Big Muddy Solar will deliver reliable clean energy while creating economic opportunities through jobs, tax revenue, and community partnerships. Dawn McClerren expressed appreciation for Arevon’s ongoing reinvestment in Jackson County, highlighting the benefits for families, schools, and local organizations.

As the long-term owner and operator of Big Muddy Solar, Arevon is committed to supporting community development throughout the life of the project. The company focuses its giving efforts on education, food and housing security, and public health and safety. In Jackson County, Arevon has already partnered with numerous organizations, including the Elverado and Murphysboro Education Foundations, Junior Achievement, Future Farmers of America, the 4-H Council, the Southern Illinois University Carbondale STEM Education Research Center, SPARK 618, Victory Dream Center, Murphysboro Food Pantry, 724 Ministries, Carbondale Warming Center, Revitalize 62966, local volunteer fire departments, the Jackson County Ambulance Service, and the Perry-Jackson Child Advocacy Center.

Local partners praised the company’s support, with leaders noting that Arevon’s contributions are helping expand STEM education opportunities, strengthen youth programs, and address urgent food insecurity across the region. Arevon is continuing to grow its renewable energy portfolio across the Midwest. The company recently began operations at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Indiana, representing a combined investment of US$400 million and 264 MWdc of new solar capacity. It is also constructing the US$500 million, 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri.

In addition, Arevon developed and managed construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project for NIPSCO and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project for Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company, ensuring successful integration of each project into its respective community. Arevon continues to advance development of additional renewable energy facilities throughout the region, strengthening the supply of clean energy and supporting long-term economic growth.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-1.png,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:58.895470

The deployment of EV charging stations are accelerating energy sovereignty across Upper Midwest tribal nations. Through a partnership between Native Sun Community Power Development Inc. and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI), smart electric vehicle charging infrastructure and related renewable energy technologies will be deployed across the region.

The initiative supports electrification and renewable energy adoption in tribal communities, while laying the foundation for future opportunities including microgrids, distributed energy resources, and energy market integration.

“We at Native Sun are fighting a human health crisis on tribal lands, and we believe renewable energy and electrification can help cure this problem,” said Robert Blake, executive director of Native Sun. “Technology and Native determination is what enables us to do this, and to empower our communities to be leaders in the clean transportation and energy space. To be able to partner with OATI on this important project, and gain so much more than a solutions provider, has been critical to our success and impact.”

Native Sun is a Minnesota-based nonprofit that has entered the final phase of deployment for its pioneering Electric Nation program. Building on agreements the organization has made with tribal nations across the Upper Midwest, OATI, through its subsidiary EVolution, will provide the EV charging infrastructure, smart charging software platform, and customer support necessary for tribal communities to have reliable charging options for their electric vehicles.

EV charging installation

The two companies are coordinating the installation of the EV charging infrastructure for these tribal nations. Once installed, each Tribe will own their station outright, along with extended warranty service for long-term ownership and benefit. The the EVolution EV charging platform provides:

Smart EV charging stations in multiple form factors and kW / MW power capacity.

A secure, cloud-hosted Smart Charge Station Network Management System (NMS).

A robust EV driver mobile app.

Full professional services for rollout and ongoing operations.

24/7 support for reliability and customer service.

With the EVolution NMS hosted in the OATI Cloud, designed specifically for mission-critical energy applications, tribal nations gain access to industry-grade security and reliability that also support data sovereignty.

“Tribal nations continue to drive the energy transition by investing in the electrification, reliability, and resilience tools critical to supporting their communities and expanding economic opportunities,” said Sasan Mokhtari, president and CEO of OATI. “OATI is honored to partner with Native Sun to bring these valuable solutions to tribes in support of their energy sovereignty goals, and in providing clean technology leadership in rural and remote communities”

The program’s impact extends beyond deploying chargers. OATI can provide tribes with further consultation, design, and planning services for development of microgrid projects, which offer community resilience and additional revenue streams, like energy market integration and the potential for commercial development from manufacturing and data center facilities. These technologies will help buffer the unreliable electrical service that can occur in these communities and provide options to mitigate the cost of “demand charges” that can spike the utility bills tied to EV chargers and other electrical demands.

Wright is correct about one thing: Renewable energy investment is extremely popular.
Meanwhile, the future of both economic opportunity and public health depends on accelerating the shift to clean energy.
CLAIM: “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.” REALITY: There’s no such thing as “clean coal.” Coal remains the dirtiest, most polluting energy source.
What’s actually essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and the AI boom is reliable, affordable, and scalable clean energy, the very renewables the second Trump administration is trying to kneecap.","CLAIM: “Wind and solar, the darlings of the last administration and so much of the world today, supply roughly 3 percent of global primary energy.”

REALITY: Wind and solar now supply about 8 percent of total world energy use, more than double Wright’s number. And that percentage is growing fast. Wind and solar contributed 40 percent of the global energy increase in 2023, making it the largest source of new energy in the world, while the energy think tank Ember estimates that renewables provided about one-third of global electricity generation in 2024. They also topped coal to become the world’s largest source of electricity in the first half of 2025—the first time that this has happened.

The transition in the United States is well underway as well. Coal once provided half the electricity nationally; now it’s down to about 16 percent, below that of renewable energy. Renewables also accounted for 96 percent of new power capacity in 2024 and are on track to surge again this year. Even with this administration’s attacks on clean energy, the United States is forecast to add 395 gigawatts of new wind, solar, and storage between 2025 and 2030.

Wright is correct about one thing: Renewable energy investment is extremely popular. As this recent International Energy Agency report points out, “clean electricity investment ‘towers above’ fossil fuel sources by 12:1 in the advanced economies, by 6:1 in China, and by 2:1 in other emerging markets and developing economies.” Global solar investment reached $252 billion in the first half of 2025 while wind reached $126 billion, with offshore wind accounting for most of the increase over the last year. Meanwhile, oil and gas demand projections for the future continue to reflect hubris, not reality. The transition to renewables is happening; the only question is whether the Trump administration will support it or needlessly (and recklessly) fight it.

CLAIM: “Everywhere wind and solar penetration have increased significantly, prices on the grid went up and stability of the grid went down.”

REALITY: Renewable energy is now the cheapest source of electricity generation, and it’s delivering lower prices and more reliable power. A recent POLITICO analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data found that of the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices.

Texas has the fastest-growing deployment of solar and storage, and analysts say that’s one reason prices have not spiked there. As the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas concluded in its report on how Texas electricity prices were moderated in 2024: “Another hot summer in Texas put the electric grid to the test, but increased capacity from solar and battery storage met the call.” Just this past summer, energy use in Texas shot up, but power prices declined, mostly due to record generation from solar and storage, according to Texas grid expert Doug Lewin.

Meanwhile, unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation.

In terms of reliability, recent grid instability has been driven largely by failing gas plants. During the catastrophic Texas freeze of 2021 (Winter Storm Uri) and the Christmas storm across the mid-Atlantic in 2022 (Winter Storm Elliott), gas systems repeatedly froze and caused blackouts.

During Winter Storm Elliot, for example, natural gas plants accounted for more than 70 percent of all unplanned outages across the mid-Atlantic grid. As Arctic air swept through the Midwest in January 2025, wind and solar kept the grid from failing. And experts say that solar with storage played a significant role in maintaining grid stability under intense heat conditions this past summer. In Texas, wholesale energy prices fell more than 70 percent between summer 2023 and summer 2024, specifically linked to the growth of solar and battery storage.

In short, wind and solar have helped strengthen grid resilience and reduce costs in many regions across the country.

CLAIM: “Coal transformed our world and made it better, extended life expectancy, and grew opportunities, and coal globally will be the largest source of electricity for decades to come. That’s not a policy, that’s not a desire, that’s just a reality.”

REALITY: Coal did help power the Industrial Revolution, but it also choked cities in smog, poisoned our water supply, and fueled the climate crisis we’re now trying to address. Beginning in the early 1970s, the United States started curbing the sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from coal plants, delivering tremendous public health benefits and preventing widespread damage from acid rain. And now, clean, cheaper energy sources have already surpassed coal globally, so the assertion that it will be the world’s largest power source for the foreseeable future is already incorrect. Even in China, long seen as coal’s final stronghold, coal now plays a diminishing role.

Wright himself implicitly acknowledges coal’s diminished importance. The day the administration announced new measures to prop up coal, Wright said on Fox Business that coal should remain 15–16 percent of the power on the grid. That’s about where it is now—a far cry from the more than 50 percent of electricity it delivered about two decades ago.

Ultimately, the United States clinging to coal isn’t “realism”; it’s regression. Coal is not bouncing back. The only question is what the timeline of its decline will look like. Meanwhile, the future of both economic opportunity and public health depends on accelerating the shift to clean energy.

CLAIM: “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”

REALITY: There’s no such thing as “clean coal.” Coal remains the dirtiest, most polluting energy source. It has the highest emissions intensity among fossil fuels and is responsible for deadly toxic air and water contamination. Coal also cannot compete. No new coal plant has been built in the United States in more than a decade; where it was once by far the largest source of electricity, it now sits fourth behind gas, renewables, and nuclear.

What’s actually essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and the AI boom is reliable, affordable, and scalable clean energy, the very renewables the second Trump administration is trying to kneecap. By blocking investments in solar, wind, storage, and grid modernization, the administration isn’t fueling innovation; it’s sabotaging progress to protect coal and fossil fuel interests, at the expense of American competitiveness.

CLAIM: “There are no oil and gas subsidies. In the United States, oil and gas and coal are huge taxpayers and don’t have any subsidies that I’m aware of. And I’ve been in the business for 40 years. So, if you can find the subsidies, tell me where they are.”",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:23.677914

That amplifies U.S. influence and undermines a faster energy transition, he added.
In that context, he said, the presence of U.S. states, cities, universities and advocacy groups at COP30 is much more than just symbolic.","BELÉM, Brazil—On the penultimate day of COP30, with nearly 200 countries close to finalizing a global roadmap toward a fossil fuel phase out, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres had a simple message for President Donald Trump and the United States: “We are waiting for you.”

Despite the absence of formal representation from the federal government at the annual climate talks, the country’s influence is still felt. Victor Menotti, interim U.S. coordinator with the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, likened the country’s presence to that of a ghost in the global climate machine.

Several senior U.S. climate diplomats from previous administrations attended COP30, including Todd Stern, Sue Biniaz and Trigg Talley, who all helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. As the U.S. State Department’s lead climate lawyer for more than 25 years, Biniaz guided U.S. legal strategy through decades of international negotiations, culminating in a key role in shaping the Paris Agreement. Talley worked on climate issues at the State Department for nearly 20 years and served as director of the Office of Global Change, coordinating climate efforts across federal departments and agencies.

They attended to facilitate communication between the “We Are Still In” coalition, which brings together U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities committed to climate action despite federal policy shifts.

Stern, a former U.S. special envoy, was instrumental in shaping U.S. climate policy from 2009 to 2016 and helped negotiate the Paris Agreement, the most significant outcome of the 33-year United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process. His participation in this year’s talk is evidence of the United States’ enduring influence in a process the Trump administration has rejected, said Menotti, adding that the U.S. still wields power through elite continuity and back-channel influence.

“The U.S. is still shaping what happens in these rooms, even without a delegation,” said Menotti, who has attended 10 climate summits, trying to bring the concerns of nonprofit climate advocacy groups to the negotiating table. “Nobody from the U.S. needed to show up here, and you would still have that big impact.”

That influence is evident far from the United Nations climate negotiation rooms, he added. For example, as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met last June in Bonn, Germany, to set the stage for COP30, Trump pushed NATO countries to increase their military spending, which sucked the air out of discussions to increase public climate financing, a key agenda item in Belém.

That push, along with the U.S.’s expansion of fossil fuel production and its pressure on allies to buy more fossil gas, has made developing countries uneasy, Menotti said. It also reinforces the perception that developed countries are evading their commitments to reduce emissions faster than developing countries.

Long-time U.S. allies who say they want to advance climate action are still feeding demand for U.S. fossil fuels. That amplifies U.S. influence and undermines a faster energy transition, he added.

In the end, Menotti said, the “ghost” in the COP machine is not just the presence of former U.S. diplomats, but the enduring grip of fossil fuel power.

“There’s the fossil fuel industry, which is global, and central to American industrial, military, financial power,” he said. “The U.S. government, under any administration, is the expression of that power.”

States, Cities and Businesses Step Up

While the U.S. federal government is currently the face of fossil fuel power, members of Congress, governors and business leaders are more pragmatic and want to stay engaged with global climate action, said Lou Leonard, dean of the School of Climate, Environment, and Society at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

“It’s really important for other governments to see the nuance of how we do things in the United States, that climate action is still happening, even when the federal government isn’t here,” said Leonard, who, in 2021, helped launch the “America Is All In” coalition, a precursor to “We Are Still In.”

“You don’t want other governments using the U.S. failure as an excuse to move back, and you certainly don’t want countries walking out and the multilateral process collapsing,” he said.

Leonard said COP is not just about negotiating global rules, but also about generating momentum that pushes governments, businesses and institutions to deliver real-world climate action.

With the rules of the Paris Agreement largely settled, the role of COP as a catalyst for implementation has become more crucial. In that context, he said, the presence of U.S. states, cities, universities and advocacy groups at COP30 is much more than just symbolic. It offers a way to keep climate progress moving despite absent or hostile federal leadership.

An agreement reached during COP30 between California and Baden-Württemberg to share tools for boosting solar power, protecting water supplies from heatwaves and floods and rolling out clean-tech jobs is proof that U.S. states can flex some climate muscle even without the federal government, Leonard said.

The coalition represents a significant share of the U.S. economy, with participating states accounting for roughly 55 percent to 60 percent of the country’s economic activity, alongside hundreds of cities, businesses and institutions pursuing climate action, Leonard said. Efforts to boost renewable energy, reduce sprawl and other measures by states, cities and businesses could cut U.S. emissions by more than 50 percent by the mid-2030s, even without federal direction.

That still falls short of what’s needed for rapid global decarbonization, but he said it remains critical for sustaining momentum and signaling continued U.S. engagement to the international community.

Is the U.S. Still Climate Spying?

There’s another, far less-visible form of American power that has long shaped the global climate landscape from behind the scenes: control over climate knowledge, said Rachel Santarsiero, director of the National Security Archive’s Climate Change Transparency Project.

For decades, the U.S. intelligence community has tracked climate change as a matter of national security by collecting satellite data through spy satellites, classified assessments and other operations, including reportedly spying on the negotiations at COP15 in Copenhagen, first revealed via Wikileaks.

All that information could help protect vulnerable countries, but remains tightly controlled, giving the U.S. influence over what the rest of the world learns about climate change and what remains hidden.

Santarsiero stressed that while there is no public way to verify active intelligence operations at COP30, it would be unrealistic to assume that the U.S. intelligence community is not monitoring the talks.

“It seems like it would be part of the conversation that the intel community is having,” she said. “Even if climate is not an administration priority, you have to think that something like a phase-out of fossil fuels is going to be in tension with what the administration is trying to do.”

Historically, such monitoring has often been intended to inform diplomacy. Intelligence agencies have long provided environmental data and assessments so negotiators would be better prepared to understand risks, anticipate instability and plan for long-term security implications, helping governments respond to climate threats.

While the COPs are often seen as a neutral space where countries work together, she said, they are also a time when major powers work to protect their interests and shape outcomes.

She said it’s impossible to separate COP30 from U.S. energy and geopolitical strategy, pointing to the administration’s push to expand coal, oil and gas production even as negotiators pressed for a fossil fuel phase-out.

“You have to think that something like a phase-out of fossil fuels is going to be in tension with what the administration is trying to do … I mean, it all leads back to U.S. competition,” she said. That means the U.S. remains embedded in the COP process, not as a stakeholder at the table, but as a strategic actor guarding its national interests.

U.S. influence on the U.N. climate talks hasn’t vanished. It’s just more diffuse and difficult to see. Even without a flag on the dais, the U.S. is still defending its markets, pressuring other countries on their energy policies and evaluating intelligence reports far from the plenary floor.

“It would be naive to pretend that’s not happening,” Santarsiero said. “These things aren’t necessarily sinister… it’s just another facet of these negotiations.”

Electric vehicles cost more upfront than gas-powered cars. The average new EV sells for $53,469 according to Kelly Blue Book data from 2023. Compare this to $48,763 for the average new gas vehicle. That’s a $4,706 difference before you even factor in other costs.

However, federal tax credits help close this gap. The Inflation Reduction Act offers up to $7,500 in tax credits for new EVs that meet specific requirements. Used EVs can qualify for up to $4,000. But these credits come with strings attached:

The vehicle must be assembled in North America

Battery components must meet domestic sourcing requirements

Your income cannot exceed certain limits ($150,000 for single filers, $300,000 for joint filers)

The vehicle price cannot exceed $55,000 for cars or $80,000 for SUVs and trucks

Many popular EVs don’t qualify for the full credit or any credit at all. Check the IRS website before counting on this savings.

Home Charging Installation Costs

Your standard 120-volt wall outlet charges an EV extremely slowly, about 3 to 5 miles of range per hour. This works only if you drive very little and can charge overnight every single night.

Most EV owners need a Level 2 charger that runs on 240 volts, the same power that runs your clothes dryer. Installing this system involves several costs:

The Charger Unit: Quality Level 2 chargers cost between $300 and $1,200. Basic models work fine, but smart chargers let you schedule charging during cheaper electricity rate hours.

Electrical Panel Upgrades: Many homes need panel upgrades to handle the extra electrical load. Older homes with 100-amp or 150-amp panels often require upgrades to 200-amp service. This costs between $1,500 and $3,000.

Installation Labor: Licensed electricians charge $500 to $2,000 for installation depending on how far your garage sits from your electrical panel and whether they need to run new wiring through walls.

Permits and Inspections: Local building codes require permits for electrical work. Budget $100 to $500 for permits and inspection fees.

Total home charging setup typically costs $2,000 to $5,000. Some utility companies offer rebates that reduce these costs by $250 to $1,000.

Electricity Costs vs. Gasoline Savings

EV advocates focus heavily on fuel savings. The math does favor electric vehicles, but the savings vary widely based on where you live and when you charge.

The average EV uses 0.34 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per mile according to the Department of Energy. With national average electricity rates of $0.16 per kWh, driving costs about $0.05 per mile.

A gas car averaging 30 mpg with gas at $3.50 per gallon costs about $0.12 per mile. This creates savings of $0.07 per mile, or $700 annually if you drive 10,000 miles.

However, electricity rates vary dramatically by location:

Hawaii: $0.42 per kWh

California: $0.30 per kWh

Louisiana: $0.09 per kWh

Washington: $0.11 per kWh

Time-of-use rates also matter. Charging during peak hours can cost twice as much as overnight charging. Smart EV owners charge between 11 PM and 7 AM when rates drop.

Public charging stations cost significantly more than home charging. DC fast chargers charge $0.40 to $0.60 per kWh, nearly triple home rates. Frequent road trippers lose much of their fuel savings advantage.

Insurance Costs Run Higher

Insurance companies charge more to cover electric vehicles. Industry data shows EV insurance costs average 25% higher than comparable gas vehicles.

Several factors drive higher premiums:

Expensive Repairs: EV-specific parts cost more and require specialized technicians. Fewer repair shops have trained EV mechanics and proper equipment.

Battery Replacement Risk: Insurance companies worry about battery damage in accidents. A replacement battery pack costs $5,000 to $20,000 depending on the model.

Higher Vehicle Values: More expensive vehicles cost more to insure. The correlation is straightforward.

Powerful Acceleration: Many EVs accelerate extremely quickly, which statistically increases accident risk. Some models 60 mph in under 4 seconds, way faster than most sports cars. A car accident lawyer handling EV cases notes that the instant torque can catch inexperienced drivers off guard, leading to more frequent collision claims.

Expect to pay $1,800 to $3,000 annually for EV insurance compared to $1,400 to $2,200 for gas vehicles.

Maintenance Costs: The Real Savings

Electric vehicles shine in maintenance costs. They have fewer moving parts and don’t need oil changes, transmission repairs, or exhaust system work.

What EVs Don’t Need:

Oil changes ($50-$100 every 5,000 miles)

Transmission service ($150-$250 every 30,000 miles)

Spark plug replacement ($100-$300 every 30,000 miles)

Exhaust system repairs ($200-$2,000 as needed)

Engine air filter changes ($20-$50 annually)

What EVs Still Need:

Tire rotations ($50-$100 every 5,000 miles)

Tire replacements (EVs wear tires faster due to weight and torque)

Brake fluid changes ($100-$150 every 2-3 years)

Cabin air filter replacement ($30-$80 annually)

Windshield wiper replacements ($20-$50 annually)

12-volt battery replacement ($100-$300 every 3-5 years)

EVs use regenerative braking, which captures energy and slows the vehicle without using traditional brakes. This extends brake pad life significantly, sometimes lasting the entire life of the vehicle.

Consumer Reports data shows EV maintenance costs average $0.06 per mile compared to $0.10 per mile for gas vehicles. Over 100,000 miles, this saves $4,000.

Battery Degradation and Replacement

EV batteries lose capacity over time. Most manufacturers warranty batteries for 8 years or 100,000 miles, guaranteeing at least 70% capacity retention.

Real-world data shows modern EVs lose about 2-3% capacity per year. After 8 years, expect 75-85% of original range. A car rated for 300 miles when new might deliver 225-255 miles after a decade.

Battery replacement costs vary wildly:

Nissan Leaf: $5,500-$8,500

Chevrolet Bolt: $16,000-$18,000

Tesla Model 3: $13,000-$16,000

Ford Mustang Mach-E: $20,000-$23,000

Most owners never replace batteries. Vehicles typically get sold or traded before batteries need replacement. The next owner inherits this potential cost.

Charging Time: The Hidden Cost

Time is money. Charging takes longer than pumping gas, and this difference has real costs.

Home Charging: 6-12 hours for a full charge on Level 2. This happens overnight, so time impact is minimal.

Public Level 2 Charging: 4-8 hours for a full charge. Useful while shopping or at work.

DC Fast Charging: 20-40 minutes to reach 80% charge. The last 20% takes another 20-30 minutes due to charging speed limitations.

Road trips require planning around charging stops. A 500-mile drive that takes 8 hours in a gas car might take 9-10 hours in an EV with charging stops. Some people consider this acceptable. Others find it frustrating.

Cold weather slows charging significantly. Winter temperatures can increase charging time by 30-50%.

Depreciation Hits Differently

Electric vehicles depreciate faster than gas cars in their first few years. Rapid improvements in battery technology and range make older models less desirable.

iSeeCars data shows EVs lose 49.1% of their value after three years compared to 39.1% for gas vehicles. A $50,000 EV drops to $25,450 in value while a $50,000 gas car drops to $30,450, a $5,000 difference.

However, depreciation patterns are shifting. As EV technology matures and gas prices remain high, used EV values are stabilizing. Tesla vehicles hold value better than most other EVs.

The 5-Year Total Cost Comparison

Let’s calculate the real cost of owning an EV for five years versus a comparable gas vehicle, using a mid-range sedan as our example.

Electric Vehicle (5 years, 60,000 miles):

Purchase price: $45,000

Federal tax credit: -$7,500

Home charging installation: $3,000

Electricity costs: $2,100

Insurance: $12,000

Maintenance: $3,600

Total: $58,200

Resale value at 5 years: -$22,500

Net cost: $35,700

Gas Vehicle (5 years, 60,000 miles):

Purchase price: $35,000

Gasoline costs: $7,200

Insurance: $9,000

Maintenance: $6,000

Total: $57,200

Resale value at 5 years: -$21,000

Net cost: $36,200

The difference? Just $500 over five years. The EV costs slightly less, but not by much.

When EVs Make Financial Sense

Electric vehicles save you money in specific situations:

You Drive a Lot: High mileage increases fuel savings. Driving 20,000 miles annually doubles your savings compared to 10,000 miles.

You Have Cheap Electricity: Low electricity rates maximize savings. Time-of-use rates help even more.

You Keep Cars Long-Term: Maintenance savings accumulate over time. Keeping an EV for 10+ years provides maximum value.

You Can Charge at Home: Avoiding public charging stations saves significant money. Home charging costs one-third the price.

Gas Prices Are High: When gas exceeds $4.50 per gallon, EVs save more money. Current gas prices directly affect the calculation.

You Get Tax Credits: Qualifying for the full federal tax credit changes the math dramatically. Without it, payback periods extend significantly.

When Gas Cars Still Win

Stick with gas vehicles if:

You Rent or Live in an Apartment: Installing home charging is impossible. Relying on public charging gets expensive and inconvenient.

You Take Frequent Road Trips: Long-distance travel suits gas vehicles better. Charging infrastructure still has gaps in rural areas.

You Need Maximum Towing Capacity: EVs lose significant range when towing. Gas trucks handle heavy loads more efficiently.

You Live in Extreme Cold: Battery performance drops in freezing temperatures. Range can decrease 30-40% in winter.

You Can’t Afford Higher Upfront Costs: Not everyone can manage higher purchase prices while waiting for long-term savings.

The Bottom Line About Shifting to EV

Electric vehicles cost more to buy but less to run. Whether they save you money depends entirely on your driving habits, local electricity rates, available tax credits, and how long you keep the vehicle.

Don’t buy an EV purely for financial reasons unless the numbers work specifically for your situation. Calculate your personal costs using actual electricity rates in your area and realistic estimates of your annual mileage.

Remember that non-financial factors matter too. Environmental impact, driving experience, and supporting new technology influence many buyers’ decisions. These benefits have value even if they don’t show up on a spreadsheet.

Do your homework, run the numbers honestly, and make the choice that fits your life and budget. Electric vehicles work great for many people, just make sure you’re one of them before making the investment.",https://speedwaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2163.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:02:21.527433

Reasons For Hope

Several U.S. states have begun offering targeted incentives for clean energy manufacturing to help counter federal fecklessness and deindustrialization!

Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania is investing to support the in-state manufacturing expansion of Eos Energy, a startup making a cutting-edge new zinc-based battery model.

“We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology.”

— Governor Josh Shapiro (D-PA)

Georgia is actively supporting Korean company Hyundai’s still-accelerating EV and battery factory work, keeping the state’s clean industry growing even in the wake of the recent shameful federal attack on a Georgia Hyundai factory site.

Tennessee is promoting workforce development to support the Blue Oval SK Ford/SK On joint venture making EV batteries for Ford’s new “center of the company” affordable EV platform.

Startup Electra just opened a new plant in Colorado with state government support, showcasing their brand-new method of producing clean steel by using “electrowinning” metal refining to produce high-quality iron, instead of coal-fired blast furnaces. They’re already attracting clients!

Even while China is dominating global manufacturing and the federal government is sabotaging the country by attacking America’s clean energy industries, many state leaders are stepping up and working hard to support innovation and technological progress. Clean manufacturing must remain a priority for state governments, both to support their local economies and to rebuild national competitiveness!

“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states.","A coalition of environment and health organizations on Thursday requested the New Mexico Environment Department take immediate action toward air monitoring and developing community health guidance following an explosion at an oil refinery in Artesia.

HF Sinclair’s Navajo Refinery, located in southeast New Mexico and the Permian Basin, experienced an explosion and fires on Oct. 31, which injured three and caused thick smoke to waft over the city.

Members of the Permian Basin Climate Justice Coalition, which represents more than 20 organizations devoted to environment, health and community advocacy, sent a letter Thursday to New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney asking for the department to take action to protect southeastern New Mexicans.

They specifically called for the department to install a permanent air monitor in Artesia; provide real-time air-quality data to the public; develop health guidance for the public in cases of industrial emergencies; hold a public meeting in Artesia within a month to let the public know the plans for air safety and monitoring; and establish a mobile air monitoring unit in the Permian Basin.

NMED stated in January 2025 that the department had secured funding for such a mobile unit through a $500,000 settlement between WildEarth Guardians and OXY USA, Inc., an oil and gas producer in the region.

“Our coalition has documented countless spills, leaks, and releases across the Permian. When something like this [explosion] happens, people deserve truth and transparency,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Numerous studies now document the health impacts experienced by people living in the oilfields. Air monitoring shouldn’t be optional in communities surrounded by refineries and fracking sites.”

NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka told Source in a written statement Thursday that the department has not had a chance to thoroughly review the coalition’s letter yet.

“Sec. Kenney and the Department are open to all community monitoring actions that can better protect New Mexican’s air quality in the wake of the HF Sinclair Navajo Refinery explosion,” Goretzka wrote.

The coalition pointed out that the NMED operates two air monitors in the Permian Basin in Carlsbad and Hobbs, but these monitors do not track air pollution around Artesia.

“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states. “An independent air monitor in this community is beyond long overdue. No parent should have to wonder whether it’s safe for their children to trick-or-treat outside, breathe the evening air, or go to school the next morning.”

Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said in a statement that air pollutants are a known cause of asthma, mortality and other ailments, and residents in the Permian Basin “deserve” to be protected from such harms.

“Action cannot be taken until the state acts to collect data and provide families with real-time information so they can protect themselves, their children and the elderly when ozone precursors, [Volatile Organic Compounds] and particulates rise to dangerous levels,” Nanasi said. “The state cannot continue to depend on the EPA to take action to protect its own residents. They are depending on NMED to take action.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinclair-1024x6811763730996.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=u1fsP73i,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:30.770881

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a “ whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump's broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gOje0xd0BasHorWey0O9Kg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_finance_889/bff2caf8141c07ee5014d360534600ac,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:16.896476

The IEA’s Energy Efficiency 2025 report shows that progress is being made on energy efficiency but its speed is being hindered by a lack of skills

Global energy efficiency progress is set to improve by 1.8% in 2025, up from around 1% in 2024 according to the IEA’s Energy Efficiency 2025 report.

However, the rate of progress has fallen to 1.3% per year on average since 2019.

This is well below the COP28 target of a 4% annual improvement by 2030.

“The acceleration in global progress on energy efficiency that we’re seeing in 2025 is encouraging, including positive signs in some major emerging economies,” says Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA.

“But our analysis shows that governments need to work even harder to ensure efficiency’s full range of benefits are enjoyed by as many people as possible

“Energy efficiency has the power to enhance people’s lives and livelihoods through greater energy security, more affordable bills, improved economic competitiveness and lower emissions.”

2. Does Saudi Arabia's AI Push Signal Shift Away From Oil?

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks advanced semiconductor technology from Washington to establish the Kingdom as an AI hub under Vision 2030

Saudi Arabia’s bid to become a global AI powerhouse has become central to diplomatic discussions in Washington, with access to high-end semiconductor chips now at the heart of dealmaking between the kingdom and the US.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s recent White House visit marks a pivotal moment in Saudi ambitions, with strategic partnerships and technology investments reinforcing the country’s Vision 2030 agenda.​​

The US continues to use export controls on advanced semiconductors as a strategic lever in global technology diplomacy, shaping deals that determine which nations can develop next-generation AI systems.

High-performance chips from leading companies such as Nvidia and AMD have become critical for constructing data centres and powering the machine learning models that underpin AI.

Recent regulatory shifts favouring Gulf nations have enabled Saudi Arabia to pursue direct access and investment in semiconductor technology, driving a wave of deals targeting AI infrastructure and cloud capabilities across the kingdom.​

Google's US$40bn Texas investment links new AI data centres to massive energy projects and workforce training, powering the state's tech future

Google has begun a large-scale data centre expansion across Texas, confirming a US$40bn investment through 2027 that is intrinsically linked to the state's energy capacity.

The programme is centred on delivering new cloud and AI infrastructure with a parallel focus on bringing new energy resources to the grid and developing a skilled workforce to build and manage it.

The investment includes plans for new data centre campuses in Armstrong and Haskell Counties, alongside an expansion of its existing facilities in Ellis County.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, describes the move as “a significant expansion of our commitment to the Lone Star State”.

“AI is poised to accelerate a new golden age of American innovation and Texas – with its optimism and talent – is leading the way,"" he adds.

Some governments and nonprofits are suing fossil fuel companies for their role in causing climate change.

But is it possible to directly connect the actions of individual fossil fuel companies to the damages caused by global warming?

Chris Callahan of Indiana University says yes.

He and a Dartmouth College scientist recently used climate models to link emissions data from major fossil fuel companies to the increase in extreme heat events around the world. Then they connected those increases to economic losses from harms like lower crop yields and reduced worker productivity.

Callahan: “We showed that major fossil fuel firms like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, can be linked to billions or even trillions of dollars in economic losses around the world from rising extreme heat over the last 30 years.”

But Callahan says the most important takeaway from this research is not any specific number. It’s the implication for climate liability lawsuits.

Callahan: “It is no longer sufficient for a company to simply say, ‘We’re one of many emitters and it’s not clear what impacts we’ve caused, so you can’t hold us liable.’ In fact, we can show what impacts have been caused by an individual emitter, and we believe that message will be important in these cases.”

Located in the eastern part of the German North Sea, it will generate 435 megawatts (MW) of clean electricity as part of the wider Nordseecluster, a group of offshore wind farms expected to reach up to 1.6 gigawatts (GW).

Once the cluster is operational, it will generate enough renewable energy to power around 1.6 million households, equivalent to five percent of all German homes. The project is jointly realised by RWE and Norges Bank Investment Management, with RWE leading construction and operation.

The Innovation Fund supports N2OWF with a grant of €95.9 million, sourced from revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System. It was selected in the 2021 large-scale call and is on track to lead the way in low-carbon offshore technologies and accelerate Europe’s clean energy transition.

Driving innovation in offshore wind

Innovation sits at the heart of N2OWF’s design. The project is among the first to deploy 15-megawatt wind turbines equipped with switchgears which are free of sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) - a potent greenhouse gas with a warming effect stronger than carbon dioxide. It utilises simpler foundation structures without a transition piece between the monopile foundation and the turbine tower. This reduces the amount of steel required, thus cutting emissions during both manufacturing and construction, also making installation more efficient.

To further lower its carbon footprint, the project opts for methanol-ready or hybrid battery-electric vessels for installations and maintenance. These cleaner ships reduce fuel consumption and help limit emissions throughout the wind farm’s lifetime.

When fully operational in early 2027, N2OWF is expected to deliver around 1,800 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity each year.

From planning to construction

The project reached financial close in January 2025, following several key milestones. The final investment decision was made on schedule, and in June 2024, the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) issued the full construction and operation permit.

Despite global supply chain challenges, N2OWF successfully secured contracts for all its main components, including turbines, foundations, substations, and vessels, ensuring manufacturing to begin without delay.

The project has now moved into the construction phase. The installation of the innovative monopile foundations has been successfully completed using advanced noise mitigation technologies designed to protect marine ecosystems. Meanwhile, factory testing of turbine and substation components is progressing, keeping the project firmly aligned with its delivery timetable.

Boosting Regional and European Value

Beyond its positive environmental and climactic impact, N2OWF brings significant economic and social benefits. In East Friesland, a new Offshore Wind Control Centre is being built in Jemgum. Once implemented in spring 2026, it will oversee RWE’s offshore wind assets across Germany and continental Europe, creating around 50 skilled jobs and strengthening the region as a hub for renewable energy expertise.

N2OWF also showcases Europe-wide industrial cooperation. Key components are being manufactured and assembled across several EU Member States, including Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. This broad collaboration supports regional economies, foster shared know-how, and reinforces Europe’s leadership in offshore wind technology.

A blueprint for tomorrow’s offshore wind

“N2OWF is an integral part of our 1.6-gigawatt Nordseecluster offshore wind project off the German coast — but it represents so much more. It is a portfolio of innovations that allow us to drive greenhouse gas reduction at an entirely new scale. We are proud that support from the Innovation Fund has enabled our team to develop a broad range of solutions, the first of which are now becoming a reality” said Sven Schulemann, RWE’s Project Director of the Nordseecluster.

By combining advanced technology with a clear commitment to reduce emissions, N2OWF contributes directly to the goals of the Clean Industrial Deal and the Europe’s climate neutrality target for 2050. It shows that innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand, delivering tangible benefits for Europe’s climate, economy, and citizens.

My team’s task was to complete the program’s first phase: creating a Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for Gates County.
Our maps captured the places Gates County residents care most about: their schools, their farmland, their roads, and the beloved Merchants Millpond State Park.
Gates County is tight-knit, welcoming, and full of people who care about their home.
If I had to sum up what I carried with me from Gates County, it’s this: data matters, but people matter more.","Cloudy skies, sound of light drizzle, swaying pine forests, and the quiet stillness of Merchants Millpond. These are just some of the images that come to mind when I think about my summer in Gates County. Tucked away in northeastern North Carolina, Gates is a small, rural county where community bonds run deep and the land itself shapes daily life. This summer, I had the privilege of learning just how closely resilience is tied to both place and people.

I worked with the Coastal Resilience Intensive Training Program (C-CRIT), a partnership between NC State University and Conservation Corps North Carolina. Modeled after the statewide Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP), C-CRIT helps counties prepare for hazards like hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and sea level rise. My team’s task was to complete the program’s first phase: creating a Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for Gates County.

When I arrived, I didn’t know the first thing about GIS mapping. The idea that my maps could guide decisions about funding or infrastructure felt overwhelming. But with the guidance of my mentors, Dr. Ward and Dr. Sanchez, I quickly discovered that maps can do more than display data, they can tell stories. Our maps captured the places Gates County residents care most about: their schools, their farmland, their roads, and the beloved Merchants Millpond State Park. We then overlaid hazards like flooding or drought to show what was at risk.

For my individual project, I focused on something that struck close to my own interests: healthcare access. I mapped hospital driving times across the county to understand how quickly residents could reach medical care. The results were sobering. Long travel times could mean delayed care during emergencies, a reality that has very real consequences for health and safety. Presenting this work as a research poster at our symposium reminded me why I’m pursuing both environmental science and medicine, to explore the ways our surroundings directly affect people’s well-being.

What I didn’t expect was how much this experience would connect with my own goals. I’m majoring in Environmental Sciences, but I plan to go to medical school after graduation. I’ve always been interested in how the environment affects people’s health, and this internship helped me see that connection up close. It’s one thing to learn about environmental health in a lecture hall and it’s another to see how a flooded road or a lack of nearby hospitals could potentially be a problem for residents. I really valued having that real world exposure.

One of the best parts of this internship was how personal it felt. We weren’t just making maps behind a screen. We were out in the community, attending commissioner meetings and talking with local leaders. We also had opportunities to talk to people who work with the RCCP and also others who are passionate about community resilience. This also gave me a new perspective and listening to people who are so passionate about what they do is so inspiring and gives me hope for the future. At first, I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about working in a rural county. I worried I might feel out of place or disconnected. But over time, I found the exact opposite. Gates County is tight-knit, welcoming, and full of people who care about their home. Some of my favorite moments were just having conversations, whether it was with the sheriff, a county commissioner, or a resident who wanted to tell us what they loved about Gates county and what they hope to see for the future. Looking back, this internship taught me so much more than how to use ArcGIS. It taught me patience and how to ask questions when I don’t know something. It taught me how to communicate science in a way that makes sense to people outside of the field. It also showed me what kind of work really excites me: the kind that blends science, public health, and direct impact on communities.

Through these experiences, I learned lessons that go beyond GIS. I learned patience, the importance of asking questions when I don’t know the answer, and how to communicate science in a way that makes sense outside of academia. Most importantly, I learned that the kind of work that excites me blends science, public health, and community connection.

C-CRIT pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best possible way. I came in with no mapping experience and left with not only technical skills, but also a stronger sense of direction for my future. Although I still plan to go into medicine, this experience taught me that resilience is about more than infrastructure but also it’s about people, their health, and the connections that tie them to the places they call home.

If I had to sum up what I carried with me from Gates County, it’s this: data matters, but people matter more. Our maps and reports may help Gates County secure grants and prepare for hazards, but the real strength of this work lies in the community’s voice. That’s what resilience truly looks like.

Moving forward, I want to keep finding ways to connect environmental science and healthcare. It’s something I’ve been interested in for a long time, and I believe more research needs to be done on how our environment impacts health. I’ve started making progress toward that goal by working in the STRIVE Study at NC State University, a collaboration between UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, Emory, and NCSU. The project focuses on how environmental factors affect liver conditions and liver health, which ties directly into my interests. I’m excited to keep building on what I learned this summer and continue exploring how science and medicine can work together to improve people’s lives.",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/11/Akshits.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:35.278704

Vienna, Austria, November 20, 2025

Chair,

The United States aligns with the joint statement delivered by Canada with what we believe is an historic number of cosponsors for a Ukraine statement at the Board and would like to make the following remarks in our national capacity. We thank the Director General for his latest report on the nuclear safety, security, and safeguards situation in Ukraine. We laud the Secretariat for its profound dedication to providing technical assistance at the nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The United States remains hopeful our diplomatic efforts to secure a durable peace between Ukraine and Russia will soon yield positive outcomes.

As the sides continue pursuing peace, we reiterate our longstanding call for all parties to refrain from taking any actions that could result in a nuclear incident in Ukraine, especially at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which remains on the front lines of active combat. Any effort to restart a reactor at the ZNPP while the conflict is ongoing would be dangerous given the grave risks of causing a nuclear incident, particularly considering the condition of the plant, obstacles to regular and expert maintenance, and the status of water and reliable power supply for cooling.

The United States continues to support the IAEA’s unique technical role assisting Ukraine in maintaining nuclear safety and security while fulfilling the obligatory safeguards activities throughout this conflict. We are pleased to contribute to this important mission, including through a pledge of three million dollars for Ukraine assistance activities in our recently announced 95 million dollar voluntary contribution.

Chair,

During this reporting period, we were extremely alarmed by the damage caused to the last of the ZNPP’s two remaining transmission cables to off-site power supply, which forced the plant to rely exclusively on emergency diesel generators for a month.

This situation is unacceptable. We are grateful for DG Grossi’s swift diplomatic efforts to negotiate temporary and localized ceasefire zones between Ukraine and the Russian Federation that allowed for the ground repair work resulting in the October 23 reconnection of the ZNPP 750 kV primary power line and the November 8 reconnection of the ZNPP 330 kV back-up power line, helping to avoid a potential nuclear incident. We were seriously concerned to hear late last week that the 750 kV line was once again damaged, an incident that only underscores ZNPP’s fragile condition. We are grateful for the quick repair work that allowed for its reconnection.

We also remain highly concerned by the ongoing risks to reliable offsite power at Ukraine’s operating nuclear power plants. Recent strikes on electrical substations and other critical infrastructure have disrupted those plants’ operations. We implore parties to refrain from actions that further imperil nuclear safety.

The report also confirms the Agency’s vital verification activities in Ukraine continue to be undertaken pursuant to Ukraine’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol despite the challenging circumstances. While we note the Agency was able to successfully conduct physical inventory verifications at several facilities in Ukraine, we remain concerned about full and unfettered implementation of such activities at the ZNPP and call on Russia not to impede the Agency’s ability to undertake these mandatory technical activities at the site. We welcome Ukraine’s continued efforts to fulfill its safeguards obligations despite the conflict, and we note the Agency has found no indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern in Ukraine.

Chair,

With these remarks, the United States takes note of the Director General’s latest report, GOV/2025/66, on Nuclear Safety, Security, and Safeguards in Ukraine and requests the report be made public.

Thank you, Chair.",https://vienna.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2025/11/54936344570_846e221dd5_o.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:03:25.185290

David Booth is Driving’s senior writer as well as the producer of Driving.ca’s Driving into the Future panels and Motor Mouth podcasts. Having written about everything from the exact benefits of Diamond Like Coating (DLC) on motorcycle camshafts to why Range Rovers are the best vehicles for those suffering from opioid-induced constipation, Booth leaves no stone unturned in his quest for automotive veritas. Besides his long tenure with Driving, he was the editor in chief of Autovision magazine for 25 years and his stories have been published in motorcycle magazines around the world including the United States, England, Germany and Australia.

Education

Graduating from Queen Elizabeth High School in 1973, Booth moved from his Northern Quebec hometown of Sept-Iles — also home to Montreal Canadiens great, Guy Carbonneau — to Ottawa to study Mechanical Engineering at Carleton University. There, he wrote a thesis on the then-burgeoning technology of anti-lock brakes for motorcycles and spent time researching the also then-burgeoning use of water tunnels for aerodynamic testing.

Experience

After three years writing for Cycle Canada magazine and another three working for the then oldest magazine in Canada, Canadian Automotive Trade, Booth, along with current Driving writer Brian Harper and then Toronto Star contributor Alex Law, created an automotive editorial services group that supplied road tests, news, and service bulletins to what was then called Southam newspapers.

When Southam became Postmedia with its purchase by Conrad Black and the subsequent introduction of the National Post, Booth was asked to start up the then Driver’s Edge section, which became Driving.ca when Postmedia moved into the digital age. In the past 41 years, Booth has tested well over 500 motorcycles, 1,500 passenger cars, and nearly every significant supercar of the last 30 years.

A new system called K-flex allows the plant to build SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans on a single assembly line.

This flexible manufacturing line reduces the time and cost typically required to retool for new vehicle models.

GEORGETOWN, KY — Autonomous sleds ferry vehicle shells, sparks dart in every direction and robotic arms as tall as basketball hoops install car windows.

Like an industrial symphony from another world, each process plays its part in the intricate choreography of Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant on Earth.

Located on a 1,300-acre plot of land 70 miles away from Louisville, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) represents the future of automotive production.

Toyota has 14 manufacturing plants all over the U.S. including in Indiana, Mississippi and Jackson, Tenn., where engine blocks and transmission cases and housings are produced. So far, TMMK is the only Toyota plant in the world to implement this new technology.

But as TMMK works to adapt its manufacturing capabilities, on Nov. 18 Toyota Motor announced it will invest more than $912 million to renovate its manufacturing sites across five states, including at TMMK and its Tennessee plant. A week before that announcement, Toyota said it's planning a $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, at the plant responsible for more than 435,600 vehicles and 714,400 engines in 2024, the company is spending $1.8 billion to introduce a more flexible, technologically advanced manufacturing line poised to redefine efficiency and scale.

Historically, manufacturing assembly lines have strict size requirements limiting production, but at TMMK that's not the case. SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans can all be built on one line, by something called K-flex.

What is Toyota's new K-flex platform?

“A lot of people think that means Kentucky flexibility, but what it really means is actually K platform flexibility,” TMMK President Kerry Creech said.

A K platform, specific to Toyota, is a shared skeleton that includes the chassis, suspension and drivetrain for Toyota-produced vehicles like the Camry, RAV, Highlander, Sienna, Lexus RX and NX.

K-flex allows for the versatility of that shared skeleton across SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans all on one line.

While only one of its three manufacturing lines has full flexibility, Creech — who began his TMMK tenure in 1990 as a powertrain production team member — said as manufacturing demands evolve, flexibility is vital across the assembly line.

Roughly 35 years ago, “we could only build a sedan” on the line due to size restrictions, he said. At that time, the industry was producing about 80% sedans and 20% light trucks and SUVs. But “now that’s flipped,” Creech added.

To meet evolving consumer demand, Toyota is rolling out new vehicle models. But the conventional retooling process for electric and hybrid vehicles can be expensive and time-consuming, slowing production and straining output.

So the automaker had to rethink how it builds cars to stay competitive in a market shifting toward electrification and diverse vehicle types, Creech said.

“Whether it’s a plug-in hybrid or a total battery electric vehicle, we had to have that flexibility,"" Creech said.

Traditionally, as automakers gear up for the latest model, they invest heavily into modifying the manufacturing line to meet the dimensions of the next vehicle. With K-flex, that’s not the case.

“So we really reduce our production preparation lead time, as well as our capital expense, which kind of gives us an advantage at this facility compared to the traditional, because each time you introduce a new vehicle, then you may be changing some of the structure that’s in there,” Vice President of Manufacturing Chad Miller said, on the intricacies needed for different vehicles.

While K-flex allows for adjustability among many of its vehicles, it doesn't encompass everything. Some larger vehicles like SUVs and framed trucks are too big to be built on the flexible line.

In addition to K platform products, TMMK also produces 4-cylinder and V6 engines, hydrogen fuel cell kits, axles, steering components, machines blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies and dies.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/07/PNAS/86571792007-tmmk-025.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 12:02:07.956789

Pittsboro, NC – On November 17, 2025, Chatham County Board of Commissioners Chair Karen Howard presented the 2025 State of Chatham County Report at the Board’s Regular Session in Pittsboro.

The State of Chatham County is the county’s annual report covering July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025, and for the first time provided in both English and Spanish.

The report highlights how the County is progressing in alignment with the Board of Commissioners’ four goal focus areas – Environment & Land Use, Governance & Public Safety, Resilience & Well-Being, and Economy & Infrastructure. By organizing the report around these goals, the County provides a clear, accountable, and transparent update on initiatives, services, and accomplishments across departments. This structure ensures that all efforts are directly tied to the broader vision for Chatham’s future.

“As Chatham County continues its historic growth, we are taking decisive steps to guide development in a way that safeguards the heritage and natural beauty that define our community,” said Karen Howard, Chair of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners. “Through thoughtful planning and strategic investment, we are laying the foundation for a vibrant economy and a brighter future for all who call Chatham home. My fellow commissioners and I are incredibly proud of the outstanding work of our staff, and we remain fully committed to ensuring that future growth reflects the community-driven vision set forth in Plan Chatham.”

The report includes key highlights:

Environment & Land Use

Chatham County is working to promote sustainability, equity, and conservation countywide.

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption continues to rise across Chatham County, reflected in a 15% increase in energy distributed through the County’s four public charging stations, which collectively delivered over 23 megawatt-hours of electricity this year. This clean energy use prevented the release of an estimated 19 tons of CO₂.

The County’s two solar energy systems generated 230 megawatt-hours—enough to power the equivalent of 13 homes for a year.

The Agricultural Preservation & Development Trust Fund awarded $325,000 for four conservation easements, securing 174 acres, with 330 additional acres pending protection.

Governance & Public Safety

Chatham County is building a safer, stronger, and more connected community for all.

But they’ve also got their fingers on the pulse of the car economy.
But this rise suggests more households are being squeezed, with some having to choose between car payments and things like covering rent or buying groceries.
“And when we start seeing them pull back, that can be a sign or a warning sign of things to come for the general economy,” Davies said.
When gauging the overall health of our economy, Davies looks for different indicators.","This is a part of an occasional series looking at aspects of Colorado’s faltering economy.

The market for new cars in the U.S. hit a significant milestone in September. For the first time, the average price topped $50,000.

That’s causing some major sticker shock for buyers. And it’s not the only indicator of whether the industry might be sputtering, which has implications for the overall economy.

Here’s a look at three factors at play in the state and beyond.

The EV Craze consumed Colorado

Bridget Myers of Boulder remembers when $50,000 could buy a home decades ago. And when she needed a new car, the price tags she saw led her to leasing an electric vehicle. Her first.

That’s because the deal she got on a new Nissan Leaf was too good to pass up.

“They had a rebate system, so it was very economical,” she said. “Instead of paying several hundred a month, I have a leased vehicle that costs $54.”

And she’s not alone. Many Coloradans rushed to buy or lease EVs, lured in by those attractive incentives.

In the third quarter of this year, battery-powered EVs made up 26.4% of the cars registered in Colorado. That big spike was largely due to federal tax credits going away right before October. Over that same period, more than 438,000 EVs were sold or leased in the U.S. That’s a tenth of the total market share nationwide.

“Good or bad, EVs were brought to us,” Jeff Silverberg, general manager of John Elway Chevrolet in Englewood, said. “It wasn't really the consumer pulling for them, it was more so the manufacturer, the governments certainly pushing them. Now, as a car dealer, I think most everyone in my position would agree, I will sell anything.”

And that includes selling EVs with savings that were “generationally good,” Silverberg said.

“There's no calculator on Earth that says a $70,000 vehicle should lease for $249. Certainly not a good one. And that's what we saw.”

Screaming deals on EVs also helped fill the growing void of compact and budget cars. While cheaper sedans like the Ford Focus have gone away, others like the Toyota Corolla keep getting more expensive.

As for Myers, leasing her Nissan Leaf was also about finding something environmentally friendly. But with the federal rebates now gone and state rebates taking a hit too, that could turn the EV market on its head. And when her lease is up, Myers isn’t sure what she’ll do.

“What we would look at is: Is it cost-effective? Would we buy this car outright? Would we continue just to lease it? Does our lease rate go up?”

Manufacturers and dealers are hedging their bets

Tommy Mica and his dad, Roman, run The Fast Lane (TFL) Car. Roman’s a former TV reporter, and now they’re content creators who cover the auto industry, and they say automakers seem unsure about the economic future.

“On the face of it, things seem good. The sales numbers are still strong,” Tommy said. “But I get that there's this underlying tone across the majority of manufacturers [that] things are not OK.”

TFL Car gets millions of views a month across its social media channels. The Micas have 22 acres of testing grounds near Berthoud, and they’re all about automotive performance. But they’ve also got their fingers on the pulse of the car economy.

And right now, tariffs are a big wildcard.

“Because these are companies that move incredibly slowly,” Tommy said. “They take years and years to make decisions, and they can't make decisions if the laws are changing every couple of weeks.”

And Tommy stressed that there’s no such thing as an American-made car anymore.

“Your cars are made from parts from around the world, and these companies are losing it trying to figure out how to keep the wheels on the bus, both literally and figuratively,” he said.

For Silverberg of John Elway Chevrolet, he said manufacturers and dealers like his are trying to hedge.

“Certainty is good for business, and positive certainty is even better than negative certainty. We don't see a lot of certainty.”

On top of fewer EV incentives and tariffs increasing costs, buyers are also seeing high interest rates and all sorts of fees that can be tacked on when buying a vehicle.

“So I think people are doing what is normal in human nature, which is keep your hands close to the vest when you're not so sure about what's going on,” Silverberg said.

What about the financials and the risks?

To be clear, people are still buying vehicles. But there are other trends to note.

For one, nearly 20% of monthly payments for new cars are above $1,000, according to Edmunds. That’s tied to more sales of big SUVs, trucks and luxury vehicles. For used vehicles, those payments now make up over 6%, which is an all-time high.

On top of bigger monthly payments, the average down payment is at its lowest in 4 years. Plus, many buyers are taking out longer-term loans. And keeping up with payments over the long term could get really tough for some buyers.

Shaun Davies, an associate professor of finance at the University of Colorado Boulder, points to subprime auto loans. Those are for people with poorer credit, and they tend to come with higher interest rates and fees.

“Delinquency rates of 60 days plus on [those] payments is ticking upward,” Davies said.

More than 6.5% of borrowers have defaulted on those loans recently, “which is definitely concerning,” Davies added.

“That's oftentimes the canary in the coal mine because these are the folks with the most limited access to credit.”

It is just one measure, and Davies stressed that subprime auto loans typically account for 15 to 20% of all auto loans. But this rise suggests more households are being squeezed, with some having to choose between car payments and things like covering rent or buying groceries.

“And when we start seeing them pull back, that can be a sign or a warning sign of things to come for the general economy,” Davies said.

When gauging the overall health of our economy, Davies looks for different indicators. And he does point to one strong sign: Banks have a lot more capital on hand than they did right before the Great Recession.

“We're not horrible yet,” he said.

Tommy Mica of TFL Car says the 1989 Cadillac Allante he bought used for around $2,000 is popular among his viewers, who love to watch videos about it.

“There is a tremendous amount of interest in cars that people can buy for under $5,000,” he said. “So this is something that we've found a niche in; folks really want to see how far their dollar can go.”

But the used market has gotten really expensive and competitive too, especially for cars made in the last five years. While reporting this story, other Coloradans said it made no sense to even consider buying used because the value just isn’t there.

And when it comes to buying a new car and getting the best deal, Mica urged shoppers not to be super picky.

“It is genuinely impossible to buy a bad new car,” he said. “Unless you get one of the very rare cases of a lemon, they are going to be reliable and safe and have good technology and be quiet and do your thing.”

Colorado’s economy is flashing warning signs. Job growth has slowed to a trickle. Layoffs are inching up. The housing market is in a slump. Both the state and its biggest population center are struggling to plug massive budget holes. On top of all that, the longest government shutdown in history was weighing on the economy.

The big question, though, is whether all the bleak data points to something more serious: recession. And the answer is complicated.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/20251119-silent-recession-cars-nff-hwv-005.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 07:59:19.520280

Just 2.6% of U.S. Foundations Fund It,Michael Kavate,,,,,https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/76-of-americans-want-climate-action-just-2-3-of-u-s-foundations-fund-it,"Most philanthropists, like most people, say they want climate action.
Only about 2.6% of U.S. grantmakers made climate grants in 2023, based on my own searches of Candid’s grants database.
Yet the share of funders making climate grants rose by less than a percentage point.
The research paper reported that 69% of respondents were willing to contribute 1% or more of their income for climate action.
But if philanthropy is ever to truly mobilize on climate change, I think funders will have to metabolize a different figure altogether.","Most philanthropists, like most people, say they want climate action.

In 2022, when the Center for Effective Philanthropy asked foundation and nonprofit leaders how pressing they see the problem of climate change, 89% said it was “very urgent” or “extremely urgent.”

It just so happens that exactly the same share, 89%, of people from around the world want their governments to take greater action on the climate crisis, according to an international survey of 130,000 people across 125 countries published last year in the journal Nature Climate Change.

And it is repeated in the name of a media campaign, The 89 Percent Project, that kicked off this year to raise awareness that an overwhelming majority of people are concerned about climate change and want stronger action, even though most believe they are in a minority.

That paradox parallels philanthropy’s puzzling relationship with the climate crisis.

It is well known that the actual grant dollars do not match grantmakers’ expressed urgency about our fast-heating planet. Less than 2% of global philanthropic spending goes toward climate mitigation, despite recent gains, according to ClimateWorks Foundation.

It is less often noted that most grantmakers are not involved at all.

Only about 2.6% of U.S. grantmakers made climate grants in 2023, based on my own searches of Candid’s grants database. Even if that’s a bit off, due to the challenges Candid faces in collecting data, that is a long, long way from the portion of Americans, 76%, who back more robust government action on climate, according to the Nature study, let alone the worldwide rate, which this study and other sources have consistently found is between 80% and 89%.

Nor has the number of climate funders changed much in recent years. Despite concerted efforts to recruit new philanthropies, and climate-fueled fires and floods afflicting ever more corners of the nation and globe, the 2.6% rate is just a few points above where it was in 2015: 1.75%.

During that decade, in the U.S. alone, massive wildfires laid waste to swathes of Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, Oklahoma and, again and again, California. A whole cast of hurricanes — Harvey, Ian, Maria, Ida, Helene, Irene — have taken lives, destroyed homes and caused billions of dollars in damage across Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, Louisiana, North Carolina, the U.S. Virgin Islands and South Carolina. Yet the share of funders making climate grants rose by less than a percentage point.

Admittedly, using Candid’s data to gauge the total number of grantmakers giving out climate funding only produces a ballpark figure. Its database, after all, relies on the typically very limited grant descriptions listed by foundations in IRS filings, or the sometimes only modestly more detailed ones made public by foundations. Many of those may not explicitly mention climate, even if it is a motivation or contributing factor.

But even if you widen the count to every grantmaker that made any kind of environmental award — on the assumption that all such funding is at least tenuously connected to climate change — then you could say that 23.6% of grantmakers issued such grants in 2023, based on my analysis.

That seems impressive. You could not say, however, that the past decade of conflagrations and calamities has increased that figure in any meaningful way. In 2015, virtually the exact same share made such awards: 23.3%.

Perhaps philanthropy should actually pay attention to a different finding from the global survey. The research paper reported that 69% of respondents were willing to contribute 1% or more of their income for climate action.

At the risk of suggesting a very low bar, imagine if every philanthropy that believes climate change is a problem gave at least 1% of their grants budget for climate causes and invested at least 1% of their endowment in climate solutions?

Not that we should assume everyone gives only 1%. Academic research suggests that simply reading this article may make grantmakers more likely to give to climate.

A 2021 experiment, by the same group of researchers who produced the global survey, gave American subjects $450 each to divide between themselves and a nonprofit fighting climate change. Most gave half the sum to the charity. The experiment found that “being informed about the true share of Americans who think that people in the U.S. should try to fight global warming increases donations” by 6.3%.

So watch out funders: This article — in fact, just its headline! — may loosen your purse strings. Admittedly, someone magically gifting you $450 to use as you see fit is not exactly a clean fit for the daily reality facing most of us. But how far is it, philosophically speaking, from the strange position occupied by most grantmakers, whose job basically consists of giving away large sums of money?

All of these numbers are compelling, at least to me. But if philanthropy is ever to truly mobilize on climate change, I think funders will have to metabolize a different figure altogether. Climate-fueled drought, disease and death has yet to reach every funder’s doorstep, but the share who will be affected down the road is the most important percentage of all: 100%.

From freight haulers and farm equipment to fire trucks and snowplows, diesel engines are the literal torque behind our economy. Yet the same engines that built the nation’s backbone are now in Washington’s crosshairs — strangled by layers of federal regulation that threaten the people who keep America moving.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) insists it’s cleaning the air. But for those who live and work beyond the Beltway, these mandates aren’t saving the planet — they’re shutting down livelihoods.

The hidden cost of “Clean Air”

Since 2010, every diesel engine sold in the U.S. has come fitted with diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems — components meant to capture soot and neutralize nitrogen oxides. In theory, they’re good for the environment. In practice, they’re crippling the very trucks that keep shelves stocked and first responders rolling.

DPFs clog, SCR units freeze, and when that happens, engines “derate” into limp mode — losing power until the system is fixed. A single failure can leave a truck stranded for days and cost upward of $5,000 to repair. For independent owner-operators, who haul 70 percent of the nation’s freight, that can mean the difference between survival and bankruptcy.

Even worse, under the Clean Air Act, simply repairing or modifying those failing systems can make a mechanic a federal felon.

When a mechanic becomes a criminal

Meet Troy Lake, a 65-year-old diesel expert from Cheyenne, Wyoming. For decades, Lake kept his community’s fleets running — farm trucks, snowplows, ambulances, and school buses. But when emissions systems began failing in subzero temperatures, Lake found himself forced to choose between obeying Washington’s regulations or keeping critical vehicles on the road.

His fix? Remove the faulty components and reprogram the engine to restore performance — a common-sense solution that kept essential services moving. But the EPA saw it differently. Under federal law, “tampering” with emissions controls carries up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines per vehicle.

In June 2024, Lake pleaded guilty to one count of emissions tampering. By December, a federal judge sentenced him to a year in prison. His shop was fined $52,500 and shut down. Ironically, during his sentence, Lake worked on the prison’s own diesel equipment — the same skills that, outside those walls, had made him a criminal.

Now home but barred from his trade, Lake carries a felony record that cost him his business, his rights, and his reputation — all for keeping his community’s engines running.

When good policy goes bad

No one disputes that diesel exhaust can harm air quality. The EPA’s emission rules dramatically cut pollution over the past decade — reducing soot by 90% and nitrogen oxides by 97%. But these results have come at an unsustainable cost to the people who depend on diesel most.

A 2023 Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association survey revealed that 40% of truckers had experienced emissions-related breakdowns. Each incident cost an average of $1,500 and countless hours of downtime. Multiply that across millions of trucks, and the burden on small businesses and rural economies is staggering.

Farmers, truckers, and local governments can’t afford the endless repair cycles. For them, Washington’s mandates translate into fewer working trucks, higher consumer costs, and dangerous response delays in emergencies.

Senator Lummis fights back

Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis sees what’s happening. She’s watched the federal government criminalize working Americans while ignoring the real-world consequences of its rules. In October 2025, she introduced the Diesel Truck Liberation Act (S. 3007) — legislation designed to restore sanity and balance.

The bill would:

Remove mandatory federal requirements for DPFs, SCRs, and onboard diagnostics.

Limit the EPA’s enforcement powers over diesel tuning and emissions deletes.

Protect mechanics and operators from prosecution for performing practical repairs.

Provide retroactive relief — vacating sentences, clearing records, and refunding fines for past convictions.

“This isn’t about pollution,” Lummis said. “It’s about common sense. Washington’s one-size-fits-all mandates don’t work for the people who keep America running.”

The EPA’s dilemma

Environmental advocates warn that such legislation could reverse decades of progress under the Clean Air Act. According to EPA estimates, fully removing emissions controls from trucks could increase soot and nitrogen oxides by as much as 50%, leading to higher pollution in areas near highways and industrial centers.

That’s a legitimate concern. Clean air matters. But it’s also true that today’s engine tuning and filtration technologies are far more advanced than those available when these mandates were written. Modern software-based solutions can meet or even exceed current tailpipe standards without fragile hardware that fails in real-world conditions.

Even current EPA leadership has acknowledged the need for flexibility and modernization. The question isn’t whether we should protect the environment — it’s whether rigid, outdated enforcement is the best way to do it.

The real-world impact

The stakes are enormous. More than half a million diesel trucks in America have already had their emissions systems removed — often out of necessity, not defiance. The trucking industry spends roughly $20 billion annually on emissions-related maintenance. For small operators, that’s unsustainable.

And the impact doesn’t stop at the loading dock. Fire departments, ambulance services, and municipal snowplows all run on diesel. If their vehicles can’t move, lives are at risk. A snowstorm doesn’t care about EPA compliance, and neither does a heart attack.

Environmentalists vs. everyday Americans

Opponents of the Diesel Truck Liberation Act argue that removing emissions hardware would increase pollution, disproportionately harming urban and low-income communities. Supporters counter that Washington’s policies have already created economic inequality by crushing rural economies and small operators.

The divide isn’t really about clean air — it’s about who gets to make the rules. Should unelected bureaucrats in D.C. dictate how a farmer in Wyoming runs his truck? Or should local communities have the flexibility to balance environmental goals with economic reality?

A turning point for common sense

The Diesel Truck Liberation Act doesn’t aim to destroy the Clean Air Act. It aims to reform it. It recognizes that environmental protection must work hand-in-hand with reliability, safety, and economic survival.

For people like Troy Lake, it’s about justice — not just for one man, but for thousands of mechanics and operators who’ve been punished for solving real problems in real America.

And there’s already a hopeful sign: President Trump recently issued a full pardon for Lake, acknowledging that enforcing broken regulations against hardworking Americans is not justice — it’s overreach.

The next step is whether Congress will follow through. The bill currently sits in the Senate Environment Committee, with hearings expected later this year. If it passes, it could set a precedent for rethinking how environmental policy is enforced — and how to protect the people who keep America running.

The road ahead

America’s diesel fleet isn’t the enemy. It’s the engine that powers our nation — from coast to coast, farm to factory, and every highway in between. Reasonable environmental goals are achievable, but not through criminalizing those who fix the equipment that keeps this country alive.

The question facing lawmakers is simple: Will they choose common sense — or continue punishing the very people who make modern life possible?

Currently, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Honda Cars offer strong hybrid vehicles in the country.","One of India’s top industry lobbies has asked the government to initiate discussions on providing range-extended electric vehicles or REEVs, a type of hybrid vehicle, tax parity with EVs to incentivise automakers to introduce such models.

REEVs are electric vehicles supported by a small internal combustion engine to charge the battery when it is running low. Currently, no Indian manufacturer sells such vehicles in India. They are not classified differently under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. Hybrids attract a tax rate of 18% and 40%, depending on their size.

The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) has written to the ministry of heavy industries (MHI) that the current tax structure would force automakers to introduce such vehicles at a higher price, as they are generally heavier and bigger in size. Assocham counts Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Toyota Kirloskar Motors India Ltd, JSW Group and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd as its members.

Incentives for hybrid vehicles have already divided Indian automakers. Japanese companies, which have mastered this technology, have been lobbying the government to offer concessions to buyers of hybrid vehicles through lower taxation, direct subsidies to consumers, or the waiver of various state and central fees like registration charges. However, Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra have opposed any incentives to hybrid vehicles, arguing that it will hurt the adoption of pure EVs.

States including Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan have removed incentives for hybrid vehicles. Currently, only Chandigarh and Haryana offer incentives for hybrids.

MHI did not respond immediately to an emailed query.

In response to Mint’s queries, an Assocham spokesperson cited that the small internal combustion engine in a REEV helps “eliminate range anxiety inherent” in battery electric vehicles.

“The ICE comes into play only to charge the battery, which helps during long intercity drives and reduces dependence on charging infrastructure. This offers a practical, immediate solution of increasing an EV range while the public charging infrastructure for pure BEVs is still developing across the nation,” Assocham said. It is for this reason that Assocham has requested that REEVs be classified under the 5% GST bracket as applicable to BEVs, it said.

In the 18 November letter addressed to MHI secretary, Assocham said incentivising REEV can help boost the penetration of clean fuel cars in India. The letter was signed by Assocham secretary general. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.

“We are grateful to the Government of India for their support on BEVs in form of GST benefit under the 5% slab and would request proportionate GST consideration for REEVs also,” the letter said, a copy of which was also sent to the Prime Minister’s Office, finance ministry, Niti Aayog and the Union roads ministry.

“Considering their ‘electric-only’ propulsion and alignment with the government’s EV objectives, we respectfully recommend that REEVs be classified under the 5% GST rate, similar to BEVs, on the basis of its propulsion system and emissions profile,” the body told the government.

The industry lobby, founded in 1920, stated that such vehicles can quickly alleviate customer range anxiety by carrying an onboard charger.

“REEVs have the vehicles propelling entirely on battery. The ICE comes into play only to charge the battery during long drives. This offers a practical, immediate solution of increasing an EV range,” the letter said.

The 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study showed that customers in the country are less interested in buying electric vehicles (EVs) than in 2024. While only 8% of customers surveyed said they would prefer EVs as their next purchase, more than a third of the respondents chose hybrids.

The lobbying for a favourable tax regime for REEVs comes when the country has seen EV penetration fall after the tax rates on internal combustion engine vehicles fell. Electric four-wheeler penetration fell from 5.12% in September to 3.24% in October, the lowest levels since February 2025, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association.

Estimates by Hyundai Motor India suggest that the share of hybrid vehicles in India’s total market will increase from 2% in the financial year 2025 to 14% by FY30 and on par with EVs.

Currently, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Honda Cars offer strong hybrid vehicles in the country.

“The government’s broader target for the remaining 70% of vehicles—after the initial 30% electric penetration—is expected to lean heavily toward hybrid or alternate technologies,” Assocham wrote in its letter. “REEVs are uniquely positioned to significantly mitigate climate impact within that 70% segment.”",https://i0.wp.com/a2ztaxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Industry-lobby-pushes-government-to-slash-GST-on-range-extended-EVs.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 07:59:24.193460

Strong market fundamentals and rising power demand continue to underpin long-term growth despite the tougher policy environment

Renewable energy investment in the US sits at a crossroads. On one hand, the market fundamentals remain strong: electricity demand is accelerating, conventional power plants are being retired, technology costs continue to fall, and the industrial base for clean energy and electrification is expanding rapidly.

On the other, the policy and regulatory environment has become increasingly difficult for businesses to operate in. Tax credits for solar and wind projects introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 have been rolled back, and multiple offshore wind project approvals have been withdrawn.

While global investors once viewed the US as a straightforward bet for large-scale renewables projects, it is now a market that demands nuance — an understanding of regional opportunities, regulatory volatility, and a shift to a longer-term perspective. Despite this complexity, the long-term case for renewables investment in the US market remains compelling.

Despite the noise, a few trends stand out as sustained drivers of renewable development across the US.

Renewables reach commercial maturity

Renewable energy is the most viable it has ever been. The combination of mature technology — onshore wind, solar photovoltaic and, to a lesser extent, battery energy storage systems — and increased global production means that clean energy can compete with other forms of energy generation on economic terms.

Solar costs have fallen by more than 80 per cent over the past decade — and this price is expected to drop further by 2030 — outcompeting natural gas and coal in most regions, even without subsidies. For investors, this cost advantage creates a resilient floor for returns, insulating projects from short-term price volatility and policy uncertainty.

Battery storage has also become an essential complement in the clean energy mix, allowing renewables such as solar to serve as reliable baseload power, rather than an intermittent supply. Combining these technologies means energy can be stored and released to the grid when demand is highest, maximising output revenues.

Data centres drive a new wave of power demand

The electricity system is entering a new phase of demand expansion. Data centre construction has accelerated sharply, driven by artificial intelligence adoption across industries.

One review by Rystad Energy found that US data centres are poised to require between 395 and 660 terawatt hours of power by 2035, representing at least 10 per cent of existing demand. The planned sites are often in clusters and cover hundreds of acres, which can put significant strain on the local grid.

To solve this issue, operators are piloting the co-location of data centres and large energy power plants. This represents a lucrative opportunity for renewable energy developers with existing thermal power plants, as they can offer hyperscale data centres sustainability, affordability and reliability by combining renewable and non-renewable assets with BESS.

Renewables are the cleanest way to meet the growing power requirement for data centres. They also have the advantage of speed; solar can be implemented much more quickly than a gas or nuclear power plant. Combining solar with BESS addresses the intermittency issue, leading to comparable electricity generation levels to gas power plants.

Hyperscalers such as Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon still have ambitious carbon-free energy goals. They are prioritising access to clean power resources that are cost-effective while still providing stable electricity.

For investors, this alignment between corporate objectives and the affordability of renewables is producing a new set of opportunities. Partnerships between data centre developers and renewables providers are becoming a growing segment of the renewables market.

Rising industrial energy needs

Another compelling dimension of the US market lies in the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and industry, in part due to investments in high-value semiconductor factories and pharmaceutical facilities.

Industry analyst forecasts suggest US power demand could rise by 15–20 per cent by 2030, driven by industrial electrification and the reshoring of manufacturing. This growth also represents a significant commercial opportunity for solar.

Distributed projects, such as solar panels on the roofs of factories, offer shorter development timelines, lower permitting risk and solutions tailored to customer requirements.

They also offer significant potential for innovation, and may be more feasible in cases where there are land permitting issues for utility-scale projects. This approach also deepens local political support for renewables by embedding economic value in communities.

Looking forward

Combined with BESS, both solar PV and onshore wind can compete with thermal power stations in terms of offering reliable, low-cost electricity generation, with the added benefit of being sustainable.

However, a shift in mindset is needed among hyperscalers and policymakers in the US if they are to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by onshore renewables.

Stable, long-term policy signals — including robust state-level frameworks — are essential. Significant grid upgrades and streamlined permitting are also required to support the necessary scale and free up interconnection and grid queues.

Storage and domestic supply chains will be the linchpins of resilience, and innovative market structures and corporate power purchase agreements will stimulate investment, even in a volatile federal environment.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/f0105cb6-eced-4309-b479-94ace2b25624.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 06:59:25.645804

Want to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits for electrification upgrades that slash emissions, reduce air pollution, and enhance the comfort of your home? You have just over a month left to get them installed.

In July, Republicans in Congress voted to end two key home-energy tax credits: the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C), worth up to $2,000 for updates like an über-efficient heat pump; and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D), which takes 30% of the cost of rooftop solar and other clean-energy installations off your federal tax bill. To qualify for the credits, projects have to be done by Dec. 31.

Ditching our fossil-fuel equipment for electric options is an opportunity to land a punch in the climate fight. More than 40% of U.S. energy-related emissions stem from how we heat, cool, and power our homes and fuel our cars, according to the nonprofit Rewiring America. Not to mention, clean alternatives are often cheaper to run than dirty-energy versions.

Still, electrifying our lives can be hard. All-electric home upgrades are often big, complex infrastructure projects. Upfront costs can be steep.

But appliances, like cars, come in a wide range of models with different features and a diversity of price points.

It’s worth spending some time to think through the options — after all, doing so could save you tens of thousands of dollars by avoiding an unnecessary electrical-service upgrade or an overpowered heat pump. But to lock in the federal discounts, you’ll need to get up to speed quickly.

That’s where Canary Media can help. I’ve pulled the most relevant stories from the archives to get you prepped on your home retrofit. Dive in anywhere you like.

Here’s a last piece of advice to help you fast-track electrification projects so that you can get those federal tax credits. Journalist Justin Gerdes, who writes the wonderfully researched newsletter Quitting Carbon, says this is his No. 1 pointer for anyone planning an all-electric home retrofit:

“Search for a specialist electrification contractor you can trust.”

To make that process easier, Rewiring America and the BetterHVAC Alliance launched the National Quality Contractor Network in September. The associated directory is full of certified installers who know and love heat pumps, heat-pump water heaters, insulation, EV chargers, and more.

Gerdes’ advice is golden in a world with or without federal tax breaks. The U.S. government continues to fund state-run home energy rebates for lower- income households. And you can still find a bonanza of state, local, and utility incentives to break up with fossil fuels.

It’s also still early in the adoption curve for many of these electrified technologies. As they become more commonplace, we could see prices drop.

So while now is a great time to invest in electric appliances and reap the benefits of a clean-energy dream home, 2026 — and the years to come — will be too.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/EL-get-all-electric-heat-pumps-solar-and-other-home-energy-upgrades-before-federal-tax-credits-expire.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7d627d2a25fad59b96c15ea5d8e3e516,N,,2025-11-21 04:58:03.631708

Mullen Automotive had recently acquired a 60-percent controlling interest in Bollinger Motors for roughly $148 million.
Despite being in business for over a decade, Bollinger Motors has very little to show for itself.","It’s not looking good for Bollinger Motors. News has emerged that the company is struggling to pay its bills while employees note that their paychecks have been delayed.

According to the Detroit Free Press, internal memos are circulating within the company that pertain to the issue and they’re not particularly encouraging.

""Unfortunately, we could not process this week’s payroll on schedule due to a delay in receiving the expected funds,"" read an email from Walter Collins, the chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. ""As of today, we do not yet have a confirmed update on funding to meet payroll ending October 31, 2025. As soon as funds are received, we will process payroll in full. I will provide updates as new information becomes available.""

The matter had not been dealt with by the following week and there were several dozen open claims against Bollinger Innovations for unpaid wages or benefits prompting an investigation from the state government.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg, apparently. Rumor has it that Bollinger’s management has effectively disbanded. This comes after announcements that the business was enacting aggressive cost-cutting measures to reduce overhead at the end of the summer. However, the rumor mill suggests that strategy has failed and the business is effectively out of cash. An insider from the company recently informed The Drive that the offices have basically been cleared out and that nobody is being paid anymore.

From The Drive:

“Bollinger Motors of Oak Park, Michigan and its parent company Bollinger Innovations have completely collapsed,” our tipster told us via email. “All Michigan based senior leadership has been forced out.”

“Employees payroll is weeks behind, with nothing answers being given to employees,” our tipster continued. “There is no operating cash left, and customers/dealers are being lied to.”

Listen, I’ll be the first one to tell you that the current regulatory landscape within the automotive industry seems custom made to deny any change of their ever being fresh competition. New automakers are insanely rare and the few that do emerge these days seem laser-focused on electrification, possibly because they think it’s the only path they can take.

But we’ve also seen countless EV startups go under after making some of the sketchiest financial plays you’ll see within an industry. Many people have accused certain companies of effectively being technology scams. There have been too many situations where a business crops up out of nowhere and makes a bunch of money via some lofty promises.

While the vast majority of these companies eventually go under, quite a few seem to have leadership that manages to get rich by dumping their stocks shortly before share prices tumble. This is after extravagant marketing campaigns and boosted IPOs have made them a bundle of money, of course. Investors cannot seem to help themselves and are often accompanied by special-purpose acquisition companies that always seem to boost the share price beyond what feels rational before everything goes sideways.

We saw this with Nikola, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Lordstown Motors, Canoo, Faraday Future, and plenty of other high-profile EV brands that ultimately didn’t go anywhere. But determining which of those companies had leadership that actually wanted to build vehicles, and which wanted to exploit investors by simply pretending to, isn’t something we can’t easily answer without psychic abilities. Visiting Lordstown Assembly, only to see a lot of underutilized space, helped us make some educated guesses that things weren’t going well.

In the case of Bollinger, the company started out in 2014 as a brand keen to build all-electric utility vehicles and pickup trucks that could handle serious abuse. That’s what drew attention to the brand and it ultimately decided to move away from SUVs on the grounds that the market was quickly becoming saturated and there were more opportunities (and government subsidization) beyond the realm of passenger vehicles.

The brand moved from New York to Michigan and started refocusing on electrified commercial vehicles in 2018. By 2022, any illusion that the original B1 and B2 passenger vehicles would ever be built was gone. Mullen Automotive had recently acquired a 60-percent controlling interest in Bollinger Motors for roughly $148 million.

However, a major financial dispute between founder Robert Bollinger and the company ultimately went into receivership last spring. Mr. Bollinger sued the company on the grounds that he wanted to recoup a $10-million loan issued the previous year. But the matter was settled with Mullen putting up the funds to pay by the following month.

Sadly, this wasn’t the only suit launched against the company this year. Several of its suppliers have also taken legal action to settle accounts to the tune of several million dollars.

With that in mind, what’s happening now seems inevitable. Without continued government funding, it’s hard to make a case for companies to build all-electric trucks, as there will be fewer reasons for other businesses to purchase them. A lot of people do not like to admit that a meaningful portion of the industry behind battery electric vehicles has been propped up by dwindling government incentives and the now-waning hype surrounding technology companies. That doesn’t suggest things will always be this way, especially as the relevant battery tech and infrastructure improves. But it does happen to be the truth at the present moment.

Despite being in business for over a decade, Bollinger Motors has very little to show for itself. The brand’s initial passenger models were never built and most of its commercial vehicles have yet to arrive. Outside of the all-electric B4 (pictured), a Class 4 vehicle that closely resembles an Isuzu NPR box truck, is really the only real product to come out of the business.

We’re wondering if that’s to remain the case indefinitely. Bollinger is now in that make-or-break phase where we’ve seen many EV companies spend the next several years promising that they’re about to turn a corner, only to see it fall further into obscurity as more aggrieved creditors come forward.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/11/20/13061/social-45132391.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-11-21 11:03:44.489757

The investments by Detroit-based General Motors (GM) and the Japan-based Toyota Group involve six existing facilities, most of which have metals-intensive aspects to their operations.

GM announced this week that it intends to spend about $250 million at its Parma Metal Center in Parma, Ohio. The automaker says the investment will enable production of sheet metal stampings to support earlier announced investments at assembly plants in Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

Stamping plants such as the one in Ohio can generate steady amounts of recyclable steel in while automotive production facilities of all kinds also yield recyclable plastic films and old corrugated containers (OCC).

“With this new commitment, GM’s total manufacturing investments for 2025 now approach $5.5 billion, underscoring the company’s aggressive commitment to domestic manufacturing and meeting customer demand across its internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicle (EV) portfolio,” states the company.

The Plano, Texas-based Toyota Motor North America business unit of Toyota earlier this week announced a series of investments in American manufacturing it said carries a $912 million price tag. Toyota says growing its hybrid vehicle production capacity is at the root of those investments.

The $900 million will be invested in facilities in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia.

The Toyota facility in Blue Springs, Mississippi, has been designated as the assembly plant for a hybrid-electric version of the Toyota Corolla.

Metals casting operations are the focus of investments at Toyota plants in Troy, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee.

The Troy casting plant will receive a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles. On its website, Toyota describes the Troy facility as using “recycled aluminum to build thousands of cylinder heads per day.”

The Jackson casting facility’s spending includes the installation of “three all-new production lines” for transaxle cases, housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles designed to increase production capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually, says Toyota. The company describes its Jackson plant as “using aluminum to create thousands of engine blocks and transmission cases and housings every day.”

At the Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, an all-new machining line for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines will be installed, while in Buffalo, West Virginia, increased assembly capacity for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, transaxles and rear motor stators comprises the focus of the investment.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” says Kevin Voelkel, a senior vice president with the company. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/11/21/toyotamfgweb.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 03:59:05.959314

This new technology hopes to change that,"In The NoCo, Erin O'Toole, Brad Turner",,,,,https://www.kunc.org/podcast/inthenoco/2025-11-20/steam-power-isnt-as-clean-as-you-might-think-this-new-technology-hopes-to-change-that,"However, the traditional method of making steam hasn’t changed in more than 150 years.
That boiler brings in water, and you burn a fuel to heat that water up to generate steam.
That super powerful heat pump allows us to take heat from the air, use electricity, and then generate steam as high as 300 up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
So we have a super powerful heat pump that allows us to do that.
But of course, as a beer lover, I love making beer.","Steam powers much of the modern world. It drove the Industrial Revolution, and is still widely used to generate electricity, to sterilize equipment used in food production and medicine, and to heat and cool large buildings.

However, the traditional method of making steam hasn’t changed in more than 150 years. It involves burning fossil fuels like coal or natural gas to heat water in a boiler --, a process which creates harmful emissions.

Which is why Todd Bandhauer felt that the old way was long overdue for an upgrade. He's a professor of mechanical engineering at Colorado State University, and co-founder and chief technical officer of a CSU spinoff company called AtmosZero.

He recently helped develop a method that uses heat from the air, rather than from burning gas or fossil fuels, to make steam generation cleaner. And Bandhauer thinks it could be transformative for manufacturing cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, heating college campuses, and brewing beer.

Earlier this month, Bandhauer was named to the Time 100 Climate list, which recognizes innovations in clean energy.

He joined Erin O’Toole to talk about why making cleaner steam could be transformative for manufacturing around the world – and how it’s already being used at New Belgium Brewing in Fort Collins.

Highlights from the conversation:

O’Toole: Could you briefly walk me through how steam is traditionally made for industrial use?

Bandhauer: For the last 150 years, you use what is called a package boiler. That boiler brings in water, and you burn a fuel to heat that water up to generate steam. That steam comes out of it and then gets transported via pipes all throughout the factory, and then it gets used on all sorts of industrial processes — like making beer.

O’Toole: And help us picture: how much does steam contribute to carbon emissions and climate change?

Bandhauer: About 8% of all the world's energy used every year is to make steam. It's probably about a third of all the energy used to transport people around — cars, buses, trains, airplanes. It’s on that same order of magnitude, so it's a huge amount.

O’Toole: So your mission was to try to find a new way to generate steam that would cut back greatly on these harmful emissions, and you discovered that a heat pump could replace these traditional fossil fuel powered boilers in very basic terms. Can you explain how this works?

Bandhauer: I think most people know what a heat pump is: Heat pumps are used in houses to basically heat when it's cold outside. What we're making is a super powerful heat pump. That super powerful heat pump allows us to take heat from the air, use electricity, and then generate steam as high as 300 up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. So you don't need to generate that high of a temperature for your house. But for industry, you need way, way higher temperatures. So we have a super powerful heat pump that allows us to do that.

O’Toole: How big is your device and how is it different from a heat pump for homes?

Bandhauer: It basically would provide heat for a whole neighborhood of folks. So not just a single house. The unit that we have in New Belgium probably could heat about 50 homes. So that's the order of magnitude that we're talking about.

O’Toole: What are the biggest challenges to getting this adopted on a wide scale?

Bandhauer: The boiler hasn't been reinvented for 150 years, and so the problem that we're addressing is we want to make it easy for all of our customers to make the switch. We really want to avoid disrupting the process industrial factories. They're 24/7, 365 days a year; if you shut them down for a few hours, they lose money. They lose a lot of money. And so we want to make it as easy as possible. For example, at New Belgium, we connected our system to their facility, opened up a valve, started generating steam, and then their boilers that they had on site were just turned down. And they just kept operating. We want to make sure there's zero interruptions at all to the process.

O’Toole: What kind of industry do you hope will be the next to give this technology a try?

Bandhauer: I think the food and beverage market in general is really ripe for this change. Think cooking. Think cleaning pipes for milk production. Think all sorts of sterilization processes. But of course, as a beer lover, I love making beer. It's incredible.

O’Toole: Attention beer makers!

Bandhauer: Yes, exactly. You know, we're in an old manufacturing facility here in Loveland, Colorado. We're at the Forge campus here on the south side of Loveland, and we are working to re-energize manufacturing here in Colorado. And so it's just really exciting and special to be a part of that.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ae698db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F5c%2F530c3aba4e729a67578608cb1fd8%2Fthumbnail-todd-bandhauer-csu-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 06:59:19.895492

The Climate Council has undertaken rapid analysis of these proposed amendments and why they would fail on climate.

The five reasons a Coalition deal on environment law would fail on climate:

Climate accountability gutted: climate impacts would be completely ignored in approval decisions – even though climate change is the greatest threat to Australia’s environment.

Free pass for polluting fossil fuel projects: By rejecting any inclusion of climate, the Coalition’s approach effectively gives new coal and gas developments a free ride through approvals. Under this deal, mega-polluting fossil fuel projects would continue to be approved unchecked by climate considerations and no guardrails would be put in place to prevent the fast-tracking of fossil fuels.

Undermines an independent EPA reducing accountability of project impacts.

Dilutes key guardrails and safeguards designed to protect our environment: including the ‘net gain’ and definition of ‘unacceptable impact’, that are crucial to stopping irreparable environmental damage and ensuring developments leave nature better off.

Fails to fix logging loopholes and land clearing exemptions that are currently contributing to the destruction of our native forests and critical habitat.

In contrast to the Coalition, the Greens’ key demands have been reported as:

A strong, independent EPA

An end to native forest logging – such as closing existing loopholes

Adequate protections for critical habitat, including from land clearing

Consideration of climate impacts to some degree (even if a ‘climate trigger’ is off the table)

No fast-tracks for polluting coal or gas projects

No wholesale handover to states of approvals – including the water trigger

Rapid analysis of Coalition deal

Watering down climate pollution information provided by companies and the requirement for companies to make plans to reduce climate pollution

Climate accountability gutted: A Coalition deal would explicitly exclude emissions disclosure and consideration of direct climate pollution from projects. This would represent an abject failure to address climate change or climate harms in any way, and risk undermining Australia’s climate targets, policies like the Safeguard Mechanism and Australia’s international commitments.

Emissions disclosure requirements and plans to reduce pollution would either be gutted completely, or left toothless – in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the Samuel Review of the EPBC Act, which recommended disclosure of “the full emissions of the development”.

This would leave our national environment law completely out of step with existing emissions disclosure requirements (that include Scope 3) in many states i.e. Environmental assessments in both New South Wales and Queensland, Environmental assessments from the Federal offshore oil and gas regulator NOPSEMA, and the Albanese Government’s own climate-related financial disclosure framework.

Fossil fuel projects given a free pass: By rejecting climate safeguards, the Coalition’s approach effectively gives new coal and gas developments a free ride through approvals. There would be no obligation to assess whether a proposed mine or gas field undermines Australia’s climate targets, nor any ban on fast‑tracking polluting projects

No guardrails against fast tracking of fossil fuels

There are currently several approval pathways in the bill that could inadvertently enable this – such as the streamlined assessment pathway, the bioregional plans, state accreditation pathways and NOPSEMA. A deal with the Coalition doesn’t set any guardrails at all to ensure polluting coal and gas projects aren’t fast-tracked, alongside the environmentally responsible clean energy and housing projects Australia needs.

The Minister retaining responsibilities, particularly around the assessment and approval of projects, and weakening the EPA’s ability to enforce the rules

Undermining an independent EPA: A core Coalition condition is to weaken the new independent Environmental Protection Agency. They want to extend political control over the EPA’s leadership – for example, by giving the minister power to sack the EPA’s CEO. This undermines the whole point of an independent watchdog. Effective oversight requires a strong, arms-length EPA. The new EPA must be free to enforce the rules without fear of political interference, otherwise environmental protections will be hollow.

Reinstating streamlined approval pathways that industries are demanding

This prioritises approval pathways and efficiency for business and industries over environmental protection.

It is noteworthy that the Coalition supports the creation of more approval pathways, when this law is supposed to reduce complexity and avoid duplication.

This is about industry trying to have a foot in both camps: if the fast lane doesn’t work for them, then they want to keep a back door open.

Redefining or watering down the “unacceptable impact” safeguard

Dilution of the ‘unacceptable impact’ safeguard: The reforms propose a new test to block projects that would cause “unacceptable impacts” on protected matters – a crucial safeguard to stop irreparable environmental damage. The Coalition appears to be attempting to water this down by weakening the definition or making it easier for decision-makers to bypass.

This test needs to be strong and objective, not weaker: it should clearly condition or prevent projects that would irreversibly harm critical ecosystems or drive species extinctions.

Redefining or diluting the concept of “net gain”

The Coalition also objects to provisions requiring developments to leave nature better off. Notably, they oppose the “net gain” requirement – a rule that any environmental damage from a project must be more than offset by repairs or improvements elsewhere.

If this requirement is watered down or scrapped, companies could tick a box with token efforts that don’t actually make up for the harm done. The result? Big projects go ahead, while our wildlife and ecosystems continue to decline.

Weaker penalties

A watered down penalty regime: Reduced accountability and compliance – letting industries/projects that break the rules or cause environmental damage off lighter by reducing penalties.

Nothing on the table regarding native forest logging, or land clearing

A deal with the Coalition would leave a gaping hole in the law by keeping native forest logging exempt from federal oversight. Right now, logging conducted under Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) isn’t subject to the EPBC Act at all – and the Coalition is not prepared to change that. This means destructive logging of our native forest could continue without meeting national environmental standards or scrutiny by the new EPA.

This decades-old loophole must be closed to protect wildlife and carbon-rich forests. A deal with the Coalition would perpetuate business-as-usual logging, undermining the credibility of any “once-in-a-generation” reform. Graeme Samuel himself strongly critiqued these exemptions for forestry, describing them as “untenable loopholes” in the context of strengthening Australia’s environmental laws. The deal also preserves a free pass for continued land clearing – exactly the kind of loophole that has contributed to Australia’s nature emergency.",https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/climate-impacts.png,N,,2025-11-21 02:58:13.787626

Final thoughts The tasks ahead for the next DEP commissioner are not unique to New Jersey.
The next DEP commissioner will serve Gov.","In the lead-up to New Jersey’s gubernatorial election, NJ Spotlight News invited former top aides and state commissioners to pen some bipartisan advice for their incoming successors. Here is guidance from two former state Department of Environmental Protection commissioners, one from a Democratic administration, the other from a Republican.

In a dramatically upended policy, funding, and political landscape, the next commissioner of New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will face on behalf of incoming Gov. Mikie Sherrill unprecedented challenges in protecting New Jersey’s environment and natural resources.

DEP has throughout its history worked in close partnership with counterparts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, and Department of Agriculture. Even where DEP’s policy has diverged from or conflicted with its federal counterparts – New Jersey often sets tougher standards and pilots innovative new approaches before other states and the federal government – federal-state tensions typically have been inconsequential to a relationship historically described as “cooperative federalism.” That has been true regardless of which party controls the White House, Congress, or Statehouse.

No more. At a panel recently convened by the nonpartisan Environmental Law Institute, current and former environmental commissioners or secretaries from both red states and blue states discussed how the fundamental pillars of “cooperative federalism” are at hazard. They cited the pending and anticipated cuts in funding to New Jersey and other states implementing federal programs, the dismantling of core federal research and enforcement programs relied on by states, and pending litigation by the Trump administration that could strip states of much of their longstanding authority

But not all of the challenges will come from Washington, and the disrupted federal-state relationship will create opportunities for New Jersey and the next DEP commissioner to burnish New Jersey’s longstanding reputation for nation-leading policy leadership.

NJDEP at the center of the affordability storm

Over the years, New Jersey’s leadership has been especially prominent in addressing the challenges of climate and energy policy. DEP’s statutory mandate to reduce climate-damaging emissions through a clean-energy transition has been hampered by volatile natural gas prices, delayed deployment and public opposition to offshore wind, uncertainty concerning vehicle emission standards, and the Trump administration’s claw-back of incentives and funding for energy efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Both major candidates running for governor this year decried what they described as an energy “affordability crisis.” They were correct, and solutions — more nuclear plants and gas pipelines, faster deployment of offshore wind — are complex and challenging and will require long term policy, political, and financial efforts to provide needed relief to families and businesses facing higher utility bills.

The Legislature already mandates procurement of electricity from New Jersey’s existing nuclear capacity, and there is little prospect that significant new nuclear capacity can come online in time to affect prices in the next governor’s first or even second term. The state already is also overly dependent on natural gas for electricity, and any new gas pipelines or plants would go online just as major Biden-approved expansions in gas export capacity create vast new demand from overseas, inevitably increasing prices.

The Trump administration’s aggressive — and arguably unlawful — interference in renewables deployment will continue to delay New Jersey consumers’ access to the cheapest, cleanest and most readily available forms of energy.

The real solutions for energy affordability lie in the technical weeds and will take time. They are strategies like upgraded transmission, more distributed generation and storage, new reforms to speed clean energy deployment, and changes to a utility model that currently rewards increases in peak demand, when prices and utility profits are highest.

The next DEP commissioner will need to work urgently and in close partnership with the Board of Public Utilities president both to show continued progress in meeting New Jersey’s clean air mandates and to stave off inevitable political pressure to weaken those mandates in purported response to affordability concerns.

A world (mostly) without federal agency partners

The draconian staff and funding cuts implemented by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have effectively hobbled EPA as a supporting partner to DEP. That will present a range of challenges for the next DEP commissioner.

DEP has long been delegated federal authority to run major programs under the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. But those programs have relied heavily on standards that EPA sets through federal rules. New Jersey often sets more protective standards and regulates specific health and environmental threats before EPA does, as has been the case with standards for arsenic, mercury, and so-called “forever chemicals” (or PFAS) in drinking water. But even such state-led initiatives rely heavily on guidance and supporting research by EPA federal agencies, now decimated in terms of staffing.

In addition, entire EPA offices that provide needed support to DEP in implementing New Jersey’s landmark but to date largely unimplemented “environmental justice” law have been eliminated entirely, including EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and Office of Civil Rights. The long-sought law inspired expectations of relief in the low-income communities and those of color that have borne the brunt of the Garden State’s industrial pollution and now face the greatest threats from climate change.

Of greatest concern are when major spills or lawbreaking affecting New Jersey’s environment are beyond DEP’s capacity or state jurisdiction, and it is unclear that any federal response will be forthcoming to support DEP.

Who will answer the call when the Garden State is hit by disasters like 2004’s Athos I spill of more than 260,000 gallons of crude oil onto 280 miles of Delaware River shoreline; or the devastation of 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, where 38 lives were lost, 2 million residents lost power, and New Jersey suffered $30 billion in economic damages?

A crisis in environmental funding

The states that are implementing regulatory authority delegated to them by EPA have always relied on federal grants to cover their costs in assuming those programs. In New Jersey’s case, that has been primarily support for salaries of DEP scientists, engineers, and technicians administering major permitting programs. If those funds and consequently DEP staff are reduced, air and water permits that already take too long to process or renew will take even longer, impairing both environmental protection and economic development.

The next DEP commissioner will also have to navigate cuts to the combined federal and state water infrastructure loans that enable cities and towns to finance clean water and safe drinking water infrastructure projects.

The next DEP commissioner will also have to navigate cuts to the combined federal and state water infrastructure loans that enable cities and towns to finance clean water and safe drinking water infrastructure projects. These funds have been essential to addressing legacy threats, like replacing ancient lead drinking water service lines, and emerging threats driven by more extreme weather, like the more intense rains driven by climate change that are overwhelming local stormwater and wastewater infrastructure.

The next commissioner also must speed the deployment of vast sums DEP already has in hand. Within the last few months, New Jersey has recovered approximately $2.5 billion from DuPont and $500 million from 3M for PFAS contamination of New Jersey waters. DEP has historically been laggard in getting those funds to worthy projects. Capably and promptly deploying those funds – and ensuring they are not diverted by the Legislature to other purposes – gives the next commissioner an unprecedented opportunity to create an enduring legacy for the governor in improving the state’s watersheds and drinking water supply, while helping cities and towns that need to protect their residents from health-threatening PFAS exposure.

Rethinking environmental protection

The damage the Trump administration is doing to regulatory processes and law enforcement will be largely irreparable. A generation of scientists, health professionals, engineers, planners, and attorneys has been dismissed or diverted from public service in the federal government.

But no candidate of either political party will be elected to public office promising to restore the regulatory system just as it was circa 2024. Nor should they. Without in any way validating what President Trump is doing, the next DEP commissioner should launch and help lead the development and piloting of better modes of environmental protection and innovative approaches to adapting to the extreme weather we can no longer prevent.

This opportunity will necessarily be fraught. Changes to any DEP regulation will raise bitter memories for environmentalists of deregulatory efforts under New Jersey’s “open for business” credo in the 1990s and the early 2000s debate over a “fast track” permitting law that in the end was never implemented.

But as the energy affordability debate highlights, outdated rules often stand in the way of climate, environmental, affordability and economic progress. For example, DEP’s slow and sclerotic regulatory processes — based on the federal model — have enabled chemical companies to mass-produce toxic new compounds entering our air, water, drinking water and bloodstreams faster than DEP can regulate or prohibit them under statutes and practices that have largely been unchanged for decades, and at the same time have slowed or blocked much-needed affordable housing and commercial/industrial projects.

As a climate-vulnerable coastal state, New Jersey will also face new threats from increases in polluted runoff driven by intense rains to increases in soot and smog attributable to a warming atmosphere. The next DEP commissioner will have the opportunity to craft much-needed responses to these threats and will need to resolve the vexing land use questions that will arise as climate reshapes our coastlines and property boundaries. Also important, the next commissioner will have to lead and mediate a statewide dialogue on those rules that govern whether rebuilding or retreat is in the best interests of public safety and equity.

Final thoughts

The tasks ahead for the next DEP commissioner are not unique to New Jersey. But New Jersey and DEP’s talented career staff have always played an outsized role in forging solutions. That role will be even greater given the scale of the challenges and opportunities before the next administration.

The next DEP commissioner will serve Gov. Sherrill best by catalyzing the changes needed to sustain and expand the Garden State’s longstanding environmental leadership.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/11/campbelldaggett.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 01:57:54.891743

The Information, an IT media outlet, reported on the 20th (local time) that SoftBank will acquire an electric vehicle plant in Rose Town, Ohio, and convert it into an equipment manufacturing facility for AI data centers. Softbank secured the site from General Motors (GM) and Foxconn in August this year and plans to start production in the first quarter of next year.

The equipment that Softbank will produce is characterized by ""modular type."" It is a method of quickly assembling and installing core modules at the site after completing the manufacturing and basic tests at the factory. The industry believes that applying a modular structure can shorten the entire process required to operate the data center from 12 months to 7 to 8 months, and that it will improve the speed by 10% to 20% on a schedule. SoftBank will supply the equipment to an open AI data center in Millum County, Texas, and additional sites that have not yet been disclosed.

OpenAI is expanding its manufacturing base on its own. On the 20th, OpenAI announced a plan to directly produce core components of data centers such as power, networking, and cooling in the United States in cooperation with Taiwan's Foxconn. Although Foxconn is well known as an iPhone assembly company, it is considered a suitable partner for OpenAI's infrastructure expansion strategy as it is expanding into AI server rack manufacturing and high-performance electronic module production.

The two companies have developed multiple generations of AI servers in parallel to speed up supply, and Foxconn is responsible for production using factories in the United States such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Indiana.

These tactics include not only climate denial, but also leveraging processes and arguments that lead to lengthy delays in action, greenwashing, advocating for ineffective policies, and spreading disinformation. This research explains the playbooks used by companies, whole sectors, and governments to avoid having to reduce emissions, and suggests regulations, public literacy efforts, and litigation options that can counter this ongoing obstruction.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.
A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,” he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/98/6985020c-f120-4142-a30f-c1e5b47e836f/691f959e07ea0.preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 23:00:32.427740

Higher steel prices, equipment delays, and shifting procurement strategies are all reshaping upstream and midstream investment patterns.
And if crude oil is ever added to the tariff schedule, the pressure would shift dramatically.","President Trump’s tariff strategy in his second term has touched almost every corner of the economy, but few sectors have felt the effects as unevenly as oil and gas. The administration has chosen not to apply tariffs to crude oil, natural gas, or refined fuel imports—yet upstream, midstream, and refining companies are still dealing with higher costs from steel, aluminum, and other essential materials. The disconnect means that the feedstock remains tariff-free, while the infrastructure needed to produce and process it is becoming more expensive.

Equipment Costs and Supply Chains: The Pressure is Upstream and Midstream

The most immediate pain point is cost inflation on equipment and materials. The current tariff package includes:

A 25% tariff on most goods from Canada and Mexico

A 10% tariff on Chinese imports

Expanded duties on steel and aluminum

For an industry that sources everything from line pipe to control systems globally, these tariffs show up quickly. Steel is the biggest factor. Drill pipe, casing, gathering lines, transmission lines, LNG tanks, refinery vessels, structural steel—almost every piece of hard infrastructure depends on it.

Offshore Magazine reported that these tariffs are expected to add 2–5% to offshore project costs, contributing to a growing list of operators delaying or renegotiating capital plans. Ernst & Young reached a similar conclusion, noting that even with strong political support for domestic drilling, steel tariffs continue to introduce planning risk, especially for multi-year projects and deepwater developments.

Chinese tariffs affect a different layer of the supply chain: electrical gear, valves, sensors, sub-sea electronics, and even the AI-enabled drilling controls now common in shale operations. When operators are budgeting tightly, a few percentage points of cost inflation can move a drilling program from “marginal” to “uneconomical.”

Crude Oil Imports: Explicitly Exempt

Unlike equipment and materials, crude oil, LNG, NGLs, gasoline, diesel, and other refined products were formally excluded from the new tariff structure. Energy Connects and Reuters confirmed in April 2025 that the White House exempted crude and fuel imports from the 10% baseline tariff and from the higher partner-specific tariffs.

The reasoning is straightforward:

Refineries depend on imported crude. Gulf Coast refineries were built to run medium and heavy crudes which isn’t a great match for domestic shale. Taxing imported crude would upend refinery economics and reduce throughput.

Fuel prices are politically sensitive. A crude import tariff would show up at the pump within days, and no administration wants to explain a sudden 20–40 cent jump in gasoline during an election year.

Targeted measures do exist—most notably a 25% tariff on Russian oil tied to broader sanctions—but these are narrow and geopolitical in nature, not part of a broad policy shift.

The Refinery Consequences If Crude Oil Is Tariffed

It’s worth considering the counterfactual, because the industry understands exactly how disruptive a crude tariff would be.

Gulf Coast refineries would take the biggest hit.

Texas and Louisiana host the world’s largest concentration of complex refineries designed for heavy blends—traditionally sourced from Latin America, Canada, and the Middle East. A 10–25% tariff on those barrels would:

Raise feedstock costs immediately

Push some refineries to run at lower utilization

Narrow or even erase refining margins on heavy crude slates

Even a 10% tariff could wipe out profitability for plants optimized for discounted foreign grades.

U.S. fuel prices would rise sharply.

Since imported crude makes up a meaningful share of refinery inputs, a tariff would move through the system quickly:

Higher crude costs lead to higher wholesale product costs

Higher wholesale costs lead to higher pump prices

Gasoline could rise anywhere from 10 to 40 cents per gallon, depending on the tariff level and the mix of crudes affected.

Exports would fall, and the U.S. could lose market share.

The U.S. is one of the world’s largest exporters of refined products. A crude tariff would raise the cost of production, making American gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel less competitive in Latin America and Europe.

It could unintentionally raise global oil prices.

If U.S. imports fell because tariffs distorted economics, producers elsewhere would shift barrels to other buyers at higher prices. The global market would tighten, and Brent could drift upward.

Refinery closures could result.

Several refineries have shut down over the past decade. A tariff-driven margin squeeze could accelerate that trend, especially for older Gulf Coast or East Coast plants.

This is precisely why both the first and second Trump administrations have avoided taxing crude imports: doing so would disrupt refinery operations, raise fuel prices, and undermine the U.S. energy advantage.

Strategic Implications for 2025–2026

Even without crude tariffs, the tariff environment has impacted U.S. oil and gas:

Project timelines are slipping as operators re-price materials.

Break-evens are creeping up, especially in shale plays that rely on imported steel.

Retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico add friction to supply chains for valves, pumps, and assembled equipment.

Refiners remain stable for now, but only because crude imports were spared.

If the administration ever decides to revisit the crude exemption, the consequences would be immediate and far-reaching.

Conclusion: A Policy That Spares Oil but Strains the System

Trump’s tariff policy has created a strange split in the energy economy. On one hand, the administration has deliberately shielded crude oil and refined product imports from new duties, preserving the supply chains that keep U.S. refineries competitive and fuel markets relatively stable. On the other hand, the same tariff regime has raised the cost of building and maintaining the very infrastructure that keeps the system running. Higher steel prices, equipment delays, and shifting procurement strategies are all reshaping upstream and midstream investment patterns.

The result is an industry absorbing indirect blows even as its core feedstock remains untouched. And if crude oil is ever added to the tariff schedule, the pressure would shift dramatically. Refiners—especially complex Gulf Coast facilities built to process heavier foreign grades—would face higher costs, narrower margins, and operational constraints that would ripple through gasoline and diesel markets. It is an outcome policymakers have so far avoided for good reason.

For now, the message is clear: tariffs may not touch the barrel, but they touch almost everything around it. The age-old question remains whether the industry can continue to adapt faster than the policy landscape shifts beneath it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/691e53043c54cb586d8ac34f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-21 01:58:18.206473

Excluding wildfires and winds blown from overseas, the EPA says the area has already met the standards.
From 2021 to 2023, the metro averaged 54 high ozone days per year.
The Valley of the Sun is particularly susceptible to high ozone days thanks to its extreme heat and high levels of industrial and vehicle emissions.
The EPA itself estimates that around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are chronically exposed to ozone pollution.","PHOENIX (CN) — As air quality in the Phoenix metro worsens, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency floated a novel suggestion this week: Exempt the area from Clean Air Act requirements because much of the valley’s air pollution is out of its control.

The agency proposed the solution Wednesday, one day before a federal judge approved a consent decree requiring the city to act on ozone pollution in the Phoenix-Mesa metro area by Feb. 3, 2026. Excluding wildfires and winds blown from overseas, the EPA says the area has already met the standards.

Members of the public now have until Dec. 19 to comment on the proposal.

“It’s outrageous that the Trump EPA wants to use international emissions as an excuse to do nothing instead of reducing the dangerous smog Phoenix residents are forced to breathe every day,” Benjamin Rankin, an associate attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a press release. “People in the Phoenix metro area can push back and demand that the Trump administration act aggressively and urgently to reduce unhealthy pollution rather than pander to the polluters causing it.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set “national ambient air quality standards” for pollutants such as ozone, commonly known as smog. The EPA set air standards for ozone in 2015 and found Phoenix-Mesa to be out of attainment, but missed its deadline to determine reattainment status in 2024, prompting environmental groups to sue this year.

In its annual “State of the Air” report, the American Lung Association ranked the Phoenix-Mesa area as fourth worst out of more than 225 metros for high ozone days. From 2021 to 2023, the metro averaged 54 high ozone days per year. The acceptable standard is three.

The metro also ranks 28th for 24-hour particle pollution and 20th for annual particle pollution.

The Valley of the Sun is particularly susceptible to high ozone days thanks to its extreme heat and high levels of industrial and vehicle emissions. But the pollution floating over the country’s hottest cities is often worsened by California wildfire smoke and, in larger quantities, air blown from overseas.

Though it’s difficult to accurately track, some estimate that as much as 80% of the metro’s pollution comes from overseas. Excluding high fire days and foreign pollutants, the EPA claims in its proposal the metro likely would have attained Clean Air Act compliance as earlier as 2020, and shouldn’t be held responsible for what is out of its control.

Origin aside, environmentalists say the agency has a responsibility to do more to protect vulnerable Americans.

People exposed to excess ozone are at risk of reduced lung function and increased respiratory problems like asthma. The EPA itself estimates that around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are chronically exposed to ozone pollution.

Ozone also causes widespread environmental harms by stunting tree growth, damaging leaves and increasing plants’ susceptibility to disease, insect damage and harsh weather.

“It’s high time that the Trump administration took action to protect people from disease-causing ozone pollution, especially children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable,” Shakoora Azimi-Gaylon, senior director of toxic exposures and pollution prevention at the Center for Environmental Health, said in the press release. “It’d be a shame if the EPA only stops sitting on its hands just to let Phoenix off the hook for its ozone problem. We must continue to fight for clean air for the millions of people living in Phoenix.”

The Maricopa Association of Governments, representing 27 cities and towns in Phoenix’s home county, presented a list of potential solutions to the Legislature in 2023, anticipating a failure to attain compliance. Suggestions included decreasing allowed nitrogen oxide emissions and implementing idling reduction technologies in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and school buses, incentives to buy partial-zero and zero emission light-duty vehicles, and replacing gas-fired heaters, boilers and cooking appliances with electric appliances.

But Republicans on the committee turned their nose at what they called “draconian” restrictions, and never acted on the proposal.

More recently, the city of Phoenix committed to planting nearly 30,000 new trees over the next five years to reduce heat and improve air quality.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2023/08/temperature-sign-phoenix.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-11-21 03:58:58.207305

The UHP601300 LFP 22 cell, developed with support from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Research, Technology, and Space under the “HEADLINE” project, targets mobility applications including electric vehicles, as well as marine, railway and construction machinery.

The cell delivers a continuous discharge specific power of 2,550 W/kg, about 60 percent higher than cells with conventional electrolytes, and a 2-second pulse discharge of 3,760 W/kg, a 10 percent improvement. The cell also demonstrates a cycle life of 2,400 at a 5 °C charge/discharge rate at room temperature before retaining 80 percent of its initial capacity, with 22 Ah capability and 24-minute full charge and discharge cycles at 110 A current. The reduced internal resistance leads to lower heat generation and improved energy efficiency.

Permitting delays are among the top issues causing solar projects to be cancelled in the United States. The good news is that forward-thinking legislators are advocating for policies that help cut the red tape preventing many Americans from going solar.

Advocates from Massachusetts and Alaska joined Utah State Representative Raymond Ward and California State Senator Scott Wiener, who highlighted recent state policy victories and emerging solar technologies coming to American markets.

Johanna Neumann, Senior Director of the 100% Renewable Campaign at Environment America, discussed the benefits of rooftop solar, the roadblocks that unnecessary red tape presents for constituents and solar installers, and how policies like “instant” permitting can help solve those problems.

Instant solar permitting allows solar installers to get permits online instantaneously; the process applies building codes consistently across projects. In jurisdictions that have adopted solar permitting, installations and inspections are faster while inspection failure rates decline– all while saving time and money.

Senator Wiener is a long-time champion of policies that enable solar energy. He sponsored California Senate Bill 379, which requires most of the state’s cities and counties to adopt instant permitting. The policy helped bring greater consistency to solar permitting across the state while streamlining previously cumbersome processes to enable more Californians to go solar faster.

Plug-in solar, a newer technology gaining traction in the American market, has become commonplace in Germany. During this event, Alaska Environment Director Dyani Chapman gave attendees a brief overview of plug-in solar technology – including its limitations and potential.

Plug-in solar goes by a few different names. Some call it “balcony solar” or “backyard solar”, others “plug-and-play”, but no matter what we call it, some legislators are paying attention to how it develops in the U.S.

Utah State Representative Raymond Ward recently sponsored a bill that passed unanimously through the Utah State legislature exempting plug-in solar from traditional interconnection agreements. Utility interconnection agreements are appropriate for solar installations that export power to the grid, but in the case of plug-in solar, which is designed not to power anything outside the household, those requirements add costs and administrative processes for a resoundingly safe technology.

So, Utah’s legislature voted unanimously for Representative Ward’s plug-in solar bill, opening up a new realm of solar potential in the state. New technologies bring new challenges, but they also bring new potential.

But the US is not entirely absent from global discussions.

—

While the federal government is absent from formal negotiations at this month’s COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, the US is still holding bilateral discussions onsite through an independent association of federally elected officials.

The Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), which represents more than 180 members of the US House of Representatives, aims to deploy them in their “soft power” role to promote climate action. Although the 17 members of Congress who prepared to go to COP30 were forced to remain home to vote on the US government shutdown, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island did attend – the only US federal representative in Belém.

“The US is not a monolith,” Max Frankel, Executive Director of SEEC Institute, told Earth.Org. “We are made up of millions of people and cities and states. Is the US taking climate action? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. There is still a vibrant action from the innovation sector, from the tech sector, from cities and states.”

Meanwhile, individual US states and their leaders – most prominently California governor and likely US presidential contender Gavin Newsom – are participating at a subnational level. The governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also participated at the event.

Just as important as bringing a US voice to COP30 is the role of SEEC and the state representatives in bringing the messages about climate change back to the US.

“[The state representatives] are here to tell their story but also to learn from other organizations and other countries. They always learn great things, hear about initiatives that are happening in other parts of the world that they can also take back home to their jurisdiction and work to implement them,” said Holm.

One state committed to forging ahead on climate action is New Mexico. Andrea Desiree Romero, a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, told Earth.Org, “States are acting independently of our federal landscape to show we’re still part of the cause. We’re committed to an energy transition where we are a net zero carbon emitter by 2045, with a 50% reduction by 2035. We’re doing a lot on the energy investment side, and we have a huge startup community in the advanced energy space. We have $1 billion in venture capital for new company investments in spaces that help us solve these problems.”

Travis Kellerman, Senior Advisor in the New Mexico Energy Department, said the state is “stepping in.”

“When we see what’s happening at the federal level, which has pulled out of their commitments and their funding, we see that the power of democracy is starting to shift to the states. This includes state policy, financing mechanisms, tax credits and incentives following the loss of the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. The idea that the federal government has to lead is not true – New Mexico has a small population but an out-sized impact in global energy,” Kellerman told Earth.Org.

Although the US will no longer abide by its previous formal climate plan, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which the Biden administration submitted late last year, individual states have set NDCs.

“Definitive NDCs from the states that match the Obama-era NDC include 26 states, representing 60% of the US GDP and similar amount of emissions. That’s 50% of the US population. It’s a bright spot to be able to show and tell,” Kellerman said.

Federal appellate courts are currently confronting pivotal questions about hazardous substance designations, cultural natural resource damages, and judicial oversight of EPA settlements.

D.C. Circuit to Hear PFAS CERCLA Hazardous Substance Designation

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments in early 2026 in a high-profile case challenging the EPA’s designation of two PFAS—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—as hazardous substances under CERCLA Section 102. This marks the first time the EPA has used this provision to regulate a substance through rulemaking.

The case — Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al. v. EPA — is drawing widespread attention due to its potential to set precedent for how PFAS are regulated and how CERCLA is interpreted going forward. The D.C. Circuit has scheduled oral arguments for January 20, 2026, emphasizing that the date is fixed unless modified by court order.

Although the rule was finalized under the Biden administration, the Trump-era EPA has opted to defend it. However, industry challengers, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and six other organizations, argue in a Nov. 14 reply brief that the rule is legally flawed and cannot be salvaged by future regulatory reforms.

Specifically, they point to EPA’s admission that its interpretation of the phrase “may present substantial danger” lacks a clear regulatory framework. While the agency intends to issue a “Framework Rule” to guide future designations and incorporate cost considerations, the challengers argue that such efforts come “too late” to validate the current rule.

9th Circuit Considers Cultural NRD Claims in Cross-Border Dispute

In a parallel Superfund battle, the 9th Circuit is reviewing an en banc petition in Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation v. Teck Cominco Metals, where Canadian officials and industry groups are backing efforts to overturn a panel ruling that permitted Washington State tribes to seek Natural Resources Damages (NRD) for cultural harms caused by toxic discharges into the Columbia River.

Teck Cominco, a Canadian mining firm, is seeking to avoid liability under CERCLA for releases from its smelter upstream in British Columbia. In amicus briefs filed in November, the Province of British Columbia and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce argue that applying CERCLA to cultural harms would violate Canadian sovereignty and expose foreign entities to sweeping liabilities under U.S. environmental laws. The Mining Association of Canada also joined in opposition.

A panel ruling in September allowed the Confederated Tribes to pursue claims that incorporate their unique cultural and spiritual ties to the Upper Columbia River, marking a significant expansion in how courts may interpret NRD liability under CERCLA.

3rd Circuit Weighs Judicial Oversight of Superfund Settlements

Meanwhile, the 3rd Circuit is assessing how much discretion courts should exercise in reviewing Superfund settlements, especially in light of recent Supreme Court decisions on agency deference. The case — USA v. Alden Leeds, et al. — involves a $150 million settlement approved by a New Jersey district court that allows a group of smaller potentially responsible parties (PRPs), known as the Small Parties Group (SPG), to avoid future liability for cleanup costs at the highly contaminated Diamond Alkali site.

Occidental Chemical Corp. (OxyChem), the largest PRP, is challenging the settlement, arguing that recent decisions — particularly the 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ruling that overturned Chevron deference — mean courts must more closely scrutinize EPA settlements.

SPG, in a brief filed Oct. 27, counters that the Loper decision applies only to legal interpretations by agencies, not to the courts’ oversight of negotiated settlements. They further cite the 2025 NEPA ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, which reaffirmed substantial deference to EPA’s discretionary settlement authority.

SPG also disputes arguments from Nokia of America, which was excluded from the settlement, asserting that its claims are premature. The case raises important questions about how EPA balances fairness and efficiency in securing cleanup funding from a wide array of responsible parties.

Summary of Emerging Legal and Policy Themes:

PFAS Hazard Designations: The D.C. Circuit will determine whether EPA’s use of CERCLA §102 to designate PFAS as hazardous substances can withstand industry challenges.

Cultural NRD Claims: The 9th Circuit may redefine the scope of CERCLA liability by deciding whether cultural resource damages are recoverable, even across international borders.

Judicial Deference to Settlements: The 3rd Circuit’s review of the Diamond Alkali settlement may set precedent for how courts evaluate complex Superfund cost allocations following major Supreme Court rulings.

These cases reflect growing tensions between environmental protection, regulatory authority, international comity, and the limits of judicial deference—issues likely to shape CERCLA’s future application across multiple dimensions.

Takeaway

These cases are poised to redefine the contours of Superfund liability. The outcomes will not only influence how emerging contaminants like PFAS are regulated, but also challenge the boundaries of judicial deference and international environmental accountability. Together, they signal a critical inflection point in the evolution of CERCLA—where scientific uncertainty, legal interpretation, and cross-border implications converge to reshape environmental governance in the United States.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Washington-Changes-Green-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 00:58:15.177821

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman pushed back against Republicans’ so-called SPEED Act, a sweeping bill that would gut core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and rig the rules to fast-track polluter projects and silence Americans. Democratic members offered a series of amendments to the legislation that would lower costs, improve public health, support community input, prevent polluter handouts, and stop Trump’s attacks on cheap, clean energy sources.

Excerpts and Highlights from Ranking Member Huffman’s Opening Remarks

“American families are struggling right now to make ends meet. Trump's tariffs have raised prices on everything. Millions of Americans are about to lose affordable health care because Republicans don't have a plan to fix the crisis that they set in motion. The last thing our constituents need right now is higher utility bills because President Trump wants to stop new transmission lines and shut down an entire sector of clean energy that can help us deliver cheap, affordable electricity.”

""While the House was out of session this fall, Democrats met with companies and organizations across the spectrum to discuss this legislation. [And] across these conversations, there was agreement that NEPA provides important benefits: benefits that force the federal government to take a hard look and carefully consider alternatives and impacts, benefits that provide transparency, benefits that provide community input and engagement. These are important pillars of NEPA that, unfortunately, are undermined in deeply disturbing ways by the legislation before us today.""

“[T]he SPEED Act [treats] environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes. Weakening environmental review won't fix permitting challenges. It certainly won't help us build the clean energy future that we need. Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

War on Clean Energy

“Wind and solar projects across this country are being shut down by this administration with the approval of Congressional Republicans. We can't ignore that. It is an essential part of the context for any serious conversation in this space. Now, if President Trump and Secretary Burgum weren't illegally blocking wind and solar projects right now, firing permitting staff, cutting funding for agencies – we'd be having a very different conversation about permitting legislation.”

""Donald Trump is not always right, as you have watched him be terribly wrong on the Epstein files, as you've watched him be terribly wrong on redistricting and this race to the bottom that he set in motion. He's not always right. And so, I'm going to urge my colleagues across the aisle to summon your independence, summon a little bit of courage once again this week, and push back on this president when he is terribly wrong – and he is terribly wrong on clean energy right now.”

“This bill is so extreme that there's simply nothing left in a meaningful way of NEPA if this were to become law. Now, Democrats are very interested in working constructively in problem solving. We would love to have a meaningful conversation, but it has to start with ending the war on clean energy, which this bill does not do in any significant way.”

“The promise of American leadership in the green economy is being squandered. In effect, as China dominates the industries and jobs of tomorrow, we're locking ourselves into a fossil fuel stalemate when we should be taking advantage of the clean energy revolution. I will continue to say this: we can't have a real conversation about permitting reform until these attacks stop.”

“Over the past few months, the Department of Energy has terminated $7.6 billion in clean energy awards. Reports show that nearly $23 billion more is on the chopping block right now. Projects that would lower energy costs, strengthen the grid, and provide thousands of jobs. These are straightforward, beneficial investments that serve only to benefit the average American, and there is no rational explanation for targeting them. The only people benefiting are Big Oil billionaires.”

Public Health and Community Input

“This bill would prevent agencies from examining harms that communities across the country are living with right now. So, consider the poster child here: Louisiana's Cancer Alley, where predominantly black neighborhoods face some of the highest pollution related cancer risks in the nation. Those risks result from cumulative emissions from many facilities over decades, impacts that are well documented and directly tied to federal permitting decisions. And under this bill, agencies would be prohibited from considering those cumulative effects because they unfold over time and across multiple sources. That's not streamlining. That's telling federal agencies to look the other way in the face of an obviously foreseeable harm.

""Agencies would be limited to analyzing only the alternatives that meet the applicant's preferred outcomes, and reasonable alternatives that would reduce environmental harm, lower costs, avoid impacts to communities, or better serve the public's interest, are excluded entirely by law. That is not reform. That is enabling biased analysis from the start. That is a thumb on the scale against the public.""

""This is an extreme and radical bill. [It’s] just chock full of these things that create an impossible gauntlet for people who are really hurt by bad projects and even illegal projects, from having any chance to challenge them. That is not an honest process. That is not a fine-tuning of NEPA. It's a dramatic, radical change to a law that protects the public.”

“[The] problem is the way the bill goes way too far in constraining environmental reviews, in eliminating, in some cases, transparency and public input. And we don't have to wonder what it looks like when you take away transparency, when you take away public input, when you make it impossible to stop a wrongheaded project that the federal government just decides to do, even if it's illegal, even if it's a crazy idea, when you make it impossible to scrutinize or stop that. We have a perfect example, and it is the East Wing of the White House right here. This is what happens when there's no transparency, when there's no scrutiny, when there's no input, when there's no way to stop a dumb idea from moving forward because you've done something like this to the NEPA process.”

Key Democratic Amendments

Huffman amendment #3 to prevent the bill from taking effect until clean energy grants such as offshore wind port grants that have been improperly rescinded by the Trump administration are reinstated and regulations are in place to prevent similar actions in the future.

Magaziner amendment #6 to clarify that renewable projects are recognized as legitimate multiple-use activities, planned responsibly, reviewed transparently, and coordinated with Tribes, states, fishermen, and local communities.

Ansari amendment #9 to amend the bill’s restrictions on the consideration of new science during much of the environmental review period. This amendment protects communities that would otherwise be put in harm’s way because an agency was forced to ignore new science about flooding, wildfire, pollution, or habitat collapse.

Rivas amendment #11 to ensure that NEPA’s public participation process is accessible and meets the needs of the community so people can have a voice in the decisions that affect their health, safety, and environment.

Rivas amendment #12 to add renewable energy to the list of national policies for the White House Council on Environmental Quality to foster and support.

Huffman amendment #13 to strike the provisions of the bill that dramatically narrows the definition of a “major Federal action” to exempt numerous projects from NEPA review and allow federal agencies to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on major infrastructure, energy, and environmental projects with no environmental review, no public input, and no accountability.

Grijalva amendment #14 to ensure that climate and environmental justice are included as national priorities pursued by the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

Min amendment #17 to repeal the Department of the Interior’s memo forcing all wind and solar energy projects through a permitting process that requires personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum at every stage of the permitting process, needlessly adding red tape to stall clean, affordable energy development.

Randall amendment #20 to exempt tribes from the bill’s restrictions that prevent them from getting judicial review, protecting their ability to challenge agency decisions that affect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and treaty obligations.

Randall amendment #22 to ensures that offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated by President Trump’s Big Ugly Bill still go through NEPA review.

Brownley amendment #24 to preserve meaningful accountability and ensure agencies correct significant errors before projects move forward.

Huffman amendment #26 to strike the provision that would prohibit agencies from considering cumulative effects of projects and foreseeable harm like pollution-related cancer risks.

Huffman amendment #28 to amend the judicial review section of the bill to ensure that federal agencies follow the law, listen to communities, and carefully consider the environmental and public-health consequences of their decisions.

Income-based Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) were established through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to make health insurance more affordable for qualifying Americans purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces. However, the APTCs now include several features that were temporarily enhanced under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) through Dec. 31, 2025.

The APTCs under permanent law state that eligibility for premium assistance is limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), among other requirements. APTCs are calculated as the difference between the premium of a benchmark health plan and an established maximum percentage of income that a household must contribute toward that plan. Under the APTCs established by the ACA, this required contribution amount increases on a sliding scale up to the 400% FPL income cap.

However, the temporarily “enhanced” credits (eAPTCs) eliminate the previous eligibility limit of 400% of FPL, allowing households earning above 400% of FPL to qualify for subsidies and leaving only the minimum income threshold of 100% of FPL in place. This temporarily removes the “subsidy cliff.” The eAPTCs also reduce the required contribution amount across all income levels. For example, households at 250% of FPL would normally be required to contribute 7.73% of the baseline premium under the permanent APTC calculation, but under the eAPTC calculation, these households are required to pay only 4% of the baseline premium, which nearly doubles the amount of premium assistance available. Under the eAPTC calculation, the maximum a household must pay is 8.5% of income toward a benchmark premium. If a household has an income high enough that 8.5% of income exceeds the benchmark premium, that household does not qualify for a subsidy.

Health insurance enrollment through the ACA Marketplaces reached 24.3 million for plan year 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020. Notably, around 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received eAPTCs in 2025. Expiration of the eAPTCs would especially affect most individuals enrolled in marketplace health insurance plans, including beneficiaries with incomes above 400% of FPL, who would no longer be eligible. Households would also see their premiums rise sharply, leading to higher uninsured rates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the uninsured population would increase by 2.2 million in 2026 alone without an extension.

The Debate Over eAPTCs

The fate of the eAPTCs became a central flashpoint during the record-breaking government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12. Republicans refused to address the subsidies until the government reopened, arguing that it should be discussed separately from government funding. In contrast, Democrats said they would refuse to support legislation to reopen the government until the subsidies were addressed, highlighting that allowing them to expire will lead to substantial price increases for millions of Marketplace enrollees.

After more than six weeks of stalled negotiations, eight Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to help pass a government funding package through Jan. 30, and the House quickly followed suit. However, the deal did not include an extension of the expiring eAPTCs. Instead, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote by mid-December on whether to extend them. There is no guarantee of passage, and House Republican leaders have not committed to bringing the measure up for a vote in their chamber. This leaves the future of eAPTCs unresolved, with open enrollment already in full swing and a Dec. 31 deadline fast approaching.

Extension of eAPTCs

Some moderate Republicans have acknowledged the importance of extending the eAPTCs. In October, 13 House Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) urging him to immediately focus on extending the eAPTCs after the government shutdown ends. The letter was led by Reps. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) and Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), reminding the speaker that millions of Americans will face skyrocketing health insurance premiums if the eAPTCs expire at the end of the year. They called on Speaker Johnson to help chart a conservative path forward on the eAPTCs, underscoring that allowing the credits to lapse without a path forward would risk real harm to their constituents. The letter does, however, call for reforms to make the credits more fiscally responsible.

Separately, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), who leads the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, has been vocal in pushing leadership to craft a bipartisan solution that is designed to pass both chambers and become law. He also led the introduction of the Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, alongside Rep. Kiggans, Problem Solvers Caucus Cochair Tom Suozzi (D-NY) and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, which would extend the enhanced subsidies through 2026 and maintain expanded eligibility for families earning above 400% of FPL.

Proposed Changes to eAPTCs

Outside of simply letting the eAPTCs expire or granting a straight extension, several notable Republicans have floated lists of possible ways to modify the eAPTCs without eliminating them entirely when they expire. Other proposed changes are likely to emerge as negotiations become more public. Some rank-and-file Democrats have been open to the idea of placing restrictions on the eAPTCs, but it is not clear whether they would be willing to accept a total phase-down of the subsidies.

Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE), Jeff Hurd (R-CO), Suozzi and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) released a “statement of principles” outlining a potential bipartisan path forward on extending the eAPTCs. The plan includes the following ideas for extending and reforming the subsidies:

Temporary Extension: A two-year extension of the eAPTCs.

Income Cap: An income cap phased out between $200,000 and $400,000.

Reform: Guardrails to prevent improper payments of eAPTCs.

Prevent “Ghost Beneficiaries”: Requirements that ACA Marketplaces confirm recipient eligibility with the Death Master File.

Crack Down on Fraud: Establish a “preponderance of evidence” standard of proof to determine when an agent or broker should be allowed to continue operating in the ACA Marketplaces.

Enhance Delivery Clarity: Requirements that Marketplaces better notify recipients of the value of eAPTCs they are receiving from the federal government.

New Income Limits

One of the Republicans’ main concerns is that the eAPTC calculation removed the cap on credits going to individuals making above four times the FPL. Key Republicans, including Reps. Kiggans and Fitzpatrick have indicated an openness to imposing new income caps. Furthermore, several members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus have floated a $200,000 income cap. Key Democratic leaders have not outright rejected the proposal and have acknowledged that most beneficiaries already earn less than $200,000. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) has signaled she would be open to potential income caps, suggesting the idea is gaining bipartisan support.

Minimum Out-of-Pocket Premiums

Another idea floated by Republicans is mandating a minimum out-of-pocket payment to unlock eligibility for the eAPTCs. Certain Republicans have alleged that millions of ACA enrollees may not even know they are enrolled in certain plans because the premiums are fully subsidized. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) has highlighted that the minimum out-of-pocket premium could be very small, citing something like $5, to make people stop and think about what they are signing up for. This policy idea could help target “phantom” ACA enrollees, a concern that House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) said would need to be addressed in any extension.

Cutting Off eAPTCs for New Enrollees and Implementing Fraud Prevention

Some Republicans are calling for allowing current eAPTC enrollees continued access but cutting off access to the enhanced tax credits for new enrollees. The creation of a “grandfathering” clause would likely be accompanied by initiatives to root out waste, fraud and abuse in such health care plans.

New Abortion Restrictions

Some conservative activists argue that the tax credits indirectly subsidize plans to cover abortion. Republican lawmakers have echoed these concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has made clear that Republicans will insist on stronger Hyde Amendment protections, which prohibit federal funding for abortion. He is joined by Sens. Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Rounds (R-SD), who warned Democrats, “you won’t get any Republican votes” without tighter restrictions.

Democrats, however, remain firmly opposed to such restrictions. Sen. Shaheen called the proposal a “nonstarter,” emphasizing that the ACA already includes guardrails to comply with the Hyde Amendment. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and other Democratic leaders have similarly rejected reopening the abortion debate. This standoff could present a major hurdle to reaching a bipartisan agreement, as Republicans view abortion restrictions as essential while Democrats insist the issue was settled when the ACA was enacted.

Alternatives to eAPTCs

Some Republicans, including President Donald Trump and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy (R-LA), have proposed redirecting federal subsidy dollars from insurers to individuals through pre-funded Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). Instead of receiving the eAPTCs that lower monthly premiums, eligible exchange enrollees would receive cash-like deposits into an account that could be used for qualified health expenses such as deductibles, co-pays, prescriptions, dental and vision services or out-of-network care. The plan has also been promoted by prominent conservative think tanks, including Paragon Health Institute.

Considering this activity, the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the eAPTCs, held a hearing on Nov. 19 to examine rising health care costs, the pending expiration of the eAPTCs and potential reforms or alternatives. Much of the discussion centered on alternative approaches rather than adjustments to the credits themselves. Republicans argued that temporary subsidies mask structural problems and promoted HSA-based and other models, while Democrats called for an immediate extension of the eAPTCs to prevent sharp premium increases for millions of enrollees.

During the hearing, Sen. Cassidy raised his HSA-based proposal again, framing it as a consumer-driven alternative that would redirect federal dollars from insurers to patient accounts to cover out-of-pocket costs. However, Democrats, like Sen. Shaheen, have stressed that the proposal would do little to help consumers facing sharply higher premiums in 2026, since HSA funds cannot be used to pay premiums and most ACA enrollees are not in bronze plans that qualify for HSAs. As a result, they argue that this approach would not offset the large premium increases expected when the eAPTCs expire.

On the House side, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee are beginning to circulate legislation that aligns with President Trump’s recent calls to redirect federal subsidy dollars away from insurers and directly to ACA enrollees. The Affordable Care and Comprehensive Economic Support through Savings (ACCESS) Act, led by Reps. Kat Cammack (R-FL) and Greg Steube (R-FL), would allow individuals to elect to receive part of their cost-sharing assistance as contributions to an HSA rather than through insurer-applied reductions in out-of-pocket costs.

Supporters argue this approach gives consumers greater control over their health spending and shifts power away from insurers. Additionally, some Republicans suggest it could lower premiums and federal deficits and allow lower-income enrollees to access more money for their health expenses. Critics, however, caution that redirecting subsidies could reduce ACA Marketplace enrollment by making comprehensive coverage less attractive, especially for younger and healthier individuals who may instead choose cheaper, less comprehensive plans or remain uninsured. While proponents view HSAs as a patient-centered alternative that increases flexibility, opponents see the option as a potential step toward weakening the ACA subsidy structure rather than a substitute for extending eAPTCs.

President Trump has started to contemplate this potential alternative to eAPTCs as part of his broader push towards health care affordability, as he says he wants a health care system where “we pay the money to people instead of the insurance companies.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) is separately working on a bill related to HSAs alongside Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), who has stated that Republicans will have a health care plan laid out by December that will lower costs. Ways and Means Committee staff are preparing presentations to walk members through the proposals, which signals that House Republicans may move ahead with Trump-aligned alternatives even as the Senate prepares for a December vote on extending the eAPTCs.

Regardless of the final approach, HSAs could be an attractive option for GOP members as they try to coalesce around a proposal in the next few weeks. Democrats largely see HSAs as a tactic to undermine the ACA and derail an extension of the tax credits.

On the Horizon

Open enrollment for ACA marketplace plans started on Nov. 1, and enrollees have received notices of planned premium increases. If Congress does not extend the eAPTCs before the end of the year, households will see a significant premium increase in their insurance plans. The Senate will have to hold a vote on the eAPTCs by mid-December, but there is no guarantee of action in the House. Over the next few weeks, lawmakers will need to coalesce around a strategy as they sort through dozens of potential options.

The new rule comes after the Supreme Court sided with a North Idaho couple who were told they would need to obtain a costly federal permit to build a new home on the shores of Priest Lake.
The court found that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only if they have a “significant nexus” to regulated waters.
Environmental groups have argued the new rule would roll back decades of progress in reducing pollutants in the environment.
“The draft rule proposed Monday by the Trump Administration removes federal protections for many wetlands and streams, but it does not minimize these state protections,” Hart said.","The federal Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new rule that would drastically reduce the number of wetlands protected by federal environmental regulations.

State officials in Idaho and Washington, meanwhile, say while they continue to review the potential impact of the rule if fully implemented, they remain committed to protecting their land from pollution.

The new rule comes after the Supreme Court sided with a North Idaho couple who were told they would need to obtain a costly federal permit to build a new home on the shores of Priest Lake. In its 2023 ruling, the court found the EPA had overstepped its regulatory authority over the “waters of the United States,” which are protected from pollution by the Clean Water Act of 1972.

The court found that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only if they have a “significant nexus” to regulated waters.

The EPA says the new rule complies with this finding. If finalized, the rule would limit federal regulation to “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water,” including streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, and wetlands that are “connected and indistinguishable” from such bodies of water.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Monday.

Zeldin added that Democrats have “weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families” for decades.

If approved, Zeldin said the rule would protect navigable waters from pollution while advancing “cooperative federalism by empowering states.”

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, if finalized, the change may strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of wetlands in the country.

Environmental groups have argued the new rule would roll back decades of progress in reducing pollutants in the environment.

Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, said in a statement that the rule “continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country.”

Manufacturing groups, meanwhile, contend the rule would provide clarity on which waterways are protected.

“Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability,” said National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons in a statement.

However, it remains unclear what impact the change could have on state regulations.

Nick Schofield, a spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, said Wednesday that the agency is in the “preliminary stages of reviewing the proposal and assessing how it aligns” with the state’s existing programs and rules.

“At this point, it’s too early to determine what the potential implications may be for wetlands in the state or for state-managed lands,” Schofield said. “Once we have a clearer understanding of the proposal and its practical effects, we’ll be able to provide more information.”

Schofield added the agency takes “its mission to protect human health and the quality of Idaho’s air, land, and water very seriously and believes fully in our vision where the quality of our environment enhances healthy living and supports thriving communities.”

Curt Hart, a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Ecology, said Tuesday that state law has provided protections over wetlands and streams for decades, laws that would not be impacted by the new rule.

“The draft rule proposed Monday by the Trump Administration removes federal protections for many wetlands and streams, but it does not minimize these state protections,” Hart said.

While the agency continues to review the proposed rule and its potential impact, Hart said wetlands are protected by a collection of state laws, including the 1945 Water Pollution Control Act, the 1972 Shoreline Management Act and the 1990 Growth Management Act.

“Wetlands are critical for reducing flooding, recharging drinking water aquifers, protecting water quality, and providing habitat necessary for the survival of salmon, migratory birds and other species,” Hart said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/T9jTcLfj0ZcFbHK7-y38UAYLFO4=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/11/19/633b4dc6aa2db.hires.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 21:58:53.270288

Susie Lee says this one drought measure must survive federal spending purges: water recycling.
“The states that surround the Colorado River — they’re red and blue,” Lee said in a Thursday interview.
In addition to Pure Water, the Bureau of Reclamation has committed to funding other water recycling projects in California, and one in Utah.
The grant program is a big help in getting water recycling projects off the ground, Pellegrino said.
“Help build resiliency, help build new supplies, reduce the reliance on the Colorado River or whatever other system it is that might be strapped.","For Las Vegas to keep its taps flowing, Rep. Susie Lee says this one drought measure must survive federal spending purges: water recycling.

Lee, D-Nev., and Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., introduced the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization Act in Congress on Thursday to reauthorize a federal grant program that will sunset in 2026. While it doesn’t currently add any more money to the program, Lee said it would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to dole out $125 million in unused funds, extending the program to 2031.

“The states that surround the Colorado River — they’re red and blue,” Lee said in a Thursday interview. “But it’s a crisis, and the reason this reauthorization is so important is to make sure we continue to have the authority to use the funding to support these programs.”

Previously, Congress folded Lee’s initial 2021 program proposal into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — a law creating a pool of funding that Republicans have tried to claw back. In 2024, a bill to nearly double the amount of funding for the program that Lee helped author stalled and did not get a hearing in committee.

To date, according to Lee’s office, the Bureau of Reclamation’s program has provided more than $125 million to Pure Water Southern California, a water recycling program in California that officials say will produce 150 million gallons of water per day that would have previously been dumped in the Pacific Ocean.

The Southern Nevada Water Authority’s board authorized the agency to give $750 million to the project in 2021. That will likely be in exchange for a transfer of water, where Nevada would be able to pull more water from Lake Mead, agency spokesman Bronson Mack said.

In addition to Pure Water, the Bureau of Reclamation has committed to funding other water recycling projects in California, and one in Utah.

Why recycle water?

Capturing, treating and sending wastewater back into Lake Mead is the single way that modern Las Vegas is able to use more than its small share of the Colorado River amid remarkable population growth.

A 2024 analysis of water recycling in the Colorado River Basin from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that Nevada outperforms on that metric, reusing about 85 percent of its wastewater.

Other states have yet to begin that journey, including Wyoming and Utah, which respectively only reuse about 3.3 and 1 percent of their wastewater, according to the study.

Colby Pellegrino, deputy general manager of resources at the water authority, said after a board meeting Thursday that water recycling projects, especially along the Colorado River Basin, are often costly and hard to pull off.

This year, a study backed that up: It can cost up to $2,000 of federal dollars per acre-foot (or about 326,000 gallons) of water saved when it comes to water recycling. That’s in contrast to far less expensive water savings from innovation in agriculture.

The grant program is a big help in getting water recycling projects off the ground, Pellegrino said.

“That was what it was aimed at: Let’s let the federal government have a way in to make a meaningful participation in these big projects,” she said. “Help build resiliency, help build new supplies, reduce the reliance on the Colorado River or whatever other system it is that might be strapped. I think that’s turned out to be a good investment.”

The 2023 Rule, which was authorized by the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), restricted the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in certain sectors. HFCs are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) used in processes including refrigeration. Under the Proposed Rule, some refrigeration equipment would be exempt from the 2023 Rule’s restrictions, and some restrictions would be delayed. Our comments identify three legal flaws in the Proposed Rule:

EPA unlawfully favors deregulation over regulation by proposing to make the final rule effective 30 days after publication, in contravention of statutory requirements. The AIM Act requires one year between publication and the effective date of any rule promulgated under the statutory authority EPA invokes here. That timing requirement is plain in the statutory text, reflects the common understanding that a deregulation is still a “rule,” coheres with the statutory scheme, and is supported by legislative history. EPA’s contention that regulatory “relief,” such as the Proposed Rule, falls outside the AIM Act’s effective-date requirement is untenable.

EPA violates the AIM Act by failing to consider the “overall economic costs and environmental impacts” of the Proposed Rule using the “best available data.” When EPA promulgated the 2023 Rule, it anticipated substantial economic and environmental benefits. Now that EPA seeks to weaken the 2023 Rule, it almost entirely neglects the likely costs of the proposed rollback. Moreover, EPA declines to use its own previous estimate of the social cost of greenhouse gases, which represent the best available data. Finally, EPA fails to consider the potential reliance interests of some regulated entities in preserving the 2023 Rule.

The Proposed Rule is arbitrary and capricious. Much the same analytical flaws that render the Proposed Rule unlawful under the AIM Act also render it inadequately reasoned under bedrock administrative law.",https://policyintegrity.org/assets/img/thumbnail.png,N,,2025-11-20 23:00:10.290310

There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy.
“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said.
Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects.
“We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.” Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts.","A group of Louisiana residents is suing Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration over state laws that allow the acquisition of private property against landowners’ wishes for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide.

Save My Louisiana, composed mostly of resident and elected officials from Allen, Beauregard, Livingston, Rapides and Vernon parishes, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state Thursday morning in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. Group president Gray Musgrove joined six other local citizens in the case against the governor and state Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. A Conservation and Energy spokesman declined to comment, citing department policy on pending litigation.

The lawsuit argues statutes on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture and storage in Louisiana law are unconstitutional. The laws “provide special privileges and immunities to private Corporations,” deny citizens their right to own property and cede judicial authority to the executive branch of state government.

There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Only one well, operated by Hackberry Carbon Sequestration in Cameron Parish, has received approval so far, with its permit okayed on Sept. 5. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Various state laws on the use of eminent domain for carbon transport and storage are listed in the lawsuit. Developers and government agencies that have successfully argued in court for the use of eminent domain to obtain property lean on the argument that the acquisition is for a greater good that outweighs the interests of the property owner. In the case of CO2 pipelines, the reasoning is that removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and storing it underground is in the interest of public health by mitigating the effects of climate change.

Supporters of the plaintiffs disagree. They include Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, a U.S. Senate candidate who joined the plaintiffs outside the courthouse for a news conference and shared his opposition to forced land acquisitions for carbon capture projects.

“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said. “This is for the benefit of a very, very small group of people who will end up making lots of money from this.”

The issue of carbon capture has divided a Republican Party in Louisiana that typically backs the fossil fuel industry, a sector that’s shown the greatest interest in developing the technology. Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects. Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would like to see Louisiana lead the way in putting the technology to use.

“Believe me, we all support the oil and gas industry in general,” said Fleming, a Republican. “But there’s a segment that wants to make even additional money by putting burden on the citizens, and that’s where we draw the line. This is not good for Louisiana.”

Mike Slocum, co-founder of Save My Louisiana and one of the plaintiffs, said that while his group staunchly backs fossil fuels, there’s a lack of transparency between the industry and state and residents of parishes where carbon capture projects are planned.

“As we started to have [Save My Louisiana] meetings, we found that the community didn’t really know what it was,” Slocum said. “We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.”

Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Most hold up the example of a ruptured CO2 pipeline in 2020 that forced the evacuation of the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, that resulted in 45 people being hospitalized. Other worries include possible groundwater contamination and the potential for leaks.

Beauregard Parish resident Mona DeFries, who owns land in Calcasieu Parish near a planned CO2 pipeline, said she feels the use of eminent domain for carbon capture is “a slap in the face” for property owners like her. Although she’s not a party in the lawsuit and hasn’t yet lost land to a project, DeFries said she supports its objectives and is concerned over environmental impacts and risk factors.

We are so excited to have them on our team — congratulations Lori Peters, Dave Wildemann, and Nicole Chandler!

All three of these new leaders went through the Sierra Club training, which culminates in a qualifying hike at a location of the leader’s choosing.

Lori chose Fort Harrison State Park (known locally as Fort Ben) in Marion County for her outing

Lori is a Sierra Club member who started joining our hikes last year, and recently became a volunteer with the Hoosier Chapter. I was excited to get to join her on the hike! Our group of eight had a wonderful time checking out the fall colors and beautiful tall trees on the trail.

“I chose Ft. Ben for my hike because it’s a beautiful state park close to home with several trails of varying difficulty levels. The Fall Creek Trail and Camp Creek Trails connect to make the perfect 3 mile loop through hills and winding paths where I’ve seen all kinds of wildlife during hikes with my husband.”

“There’s a massive, beautiful sycamore tree close to the start of the hike where we took a group photo. It’s a real show stopper and I think everyone enjoyed seeing it. Learning from others while on the hike was another highlight. Laurie, Dave, and Marilyn pointed out wildflowers, invasive plants, and unique trees helping me put a name to things I’ve seen so many times but didn’t know what they were.” - Lori

Dave led his hike at Laura Hare Nature Preserve at Downey Hill in Brown County

Dave joined the Winding Waters Group Executive Committee earlier this year after discovering the Group through their annual native plant sale. Eleven folks ventured out on a beautiful fall day in Brown County for his qualifying hike.

“I chose a trail at one of my favorite nature preserves, Laura Hare Nature Preserve at Downey Hill. I was very familiar with the location, trail, and terrain. I was able to highlight features along the trail. We had a wonderful sunny day and near peak fall colors. I could not have asked for a better day.” - Dave

Nicole chose Green's Bluff Nature Preserve in Owen County for her outing

Nicole is the Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer. She decided to follow in the footsteps of fellow Sierra Club staff member Robyn Skuya-Boss (our Chapter Director) who became an Outings Leader last year!

“I chose Green's Bluff Nature Preserve because it holds a special place in my heart. I hiked this trail many times while in graduate school at IU. Highlights from the hike were the beautiful fall colors from the trees and taking a water break by Racoon Creek.” - Nicole

Congratulations to all of our new Outings Leaders on completing their certification!

Hearing the experiences of my fellow Hoosiers’ journey to become Outings Leaders, I can really feel the urge to get outside and connect with nature and our communities.

That’s why I’ve decided to join the next Outings Leadership training cohort this winter. Would you like to join me?

Here is what our new leaders said about the training:

“I felt the process to become an Outings Leader was fairly straightforward and enjoyable. I would encourage anyone who is interested and capable to become an Outings Leader. We spend less and less time outside, so any opportunity to do so is a positive!” - Nicole

“It was easy and straightforward to complete the online training. It was convenient and self-paced which helped avoid conflicts that a fixed schedule training program could have. My biggest challenge was devoting the time to complete the training. If you enjoy hiking, becoming an Outings Leader is an opportunity to share that passion with others. The Outings Leader training provides you with information to plan and lead hikes in a structured manner.” - Dave

“As a new member I really enjoyed the training modules. I learned so much, not only about how to become an Outings Leader, but the history of the Sierra Club as well. Being an Outings Leader is definitely outside of my comfort zone, but the people in the Sierra Club are so supportive and kind in nature that it made it a real treat to host them on a hike on my local trails. If you’re apprehensive, just know that there’s really nothing more to it than taking some friends on a walk in the woods. You can cover important topics and issues - or not! Come as you are. Be respectful, and take a chance to put yourself out there!” - Lori

I’ll give the last word to our Chapter Director, Robyn: “Outings Leaders distinguish Sierra Club as a community that prioritizes the critical connections spending time outdoors together can build. Connections which sustain us as we advocate to protect our environment at this challenging moment in history for our environment. Becoming a certified outing leader expands the number of critical connections we can make that keep our community resilient and strong.”

BYD’s presence is also being felt at the ongoing COP30 climate summit in Brazil’s Belem, where it is a cosponsor alongside GWM, another Chinese electric carmaker.

The sponsorship is just one of many ways that China’s investments in green technology are being felt at the UN’s top climate meeting, where the Chinese official delegation of 789 people is second only to Brazil’s 3,805.

It is a stark contrast to the United States, whose federal government has not sent an official delegation. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has accused US President Donald Trump of “handing the future to China” and leaving states like California to pick up the slack, in a speech at the summit.

“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said. Trump has called concerns over climate change a “hoax” and a “con job”.

But the UN Climate Change Conference COP30 is not the only event where the diverging paths that China and the US are taking on addressing the climate crisis are being felt.

Back in the US, and in neighbouring Canada, trade barriers aimed at punishing Chinese electric vehicles have made them far costlier than what the manufacturers want to sell them for.

These tariffs are a legacy of former US President Joe Biden’s administration, and place North America as an outlier at a time when Chinese EVs otherwise dominate the global market.

How dominant is China in EVs?

Joel Jaeger, a senior research associate with the World Resources Institute, told Al Jazeera that Chinese EVs have “really upended the car market” in recent years.

China has gone “from basically not a major player five years ago” to becoming “the number one exporter of cars globally in terms of the units”, says Jaeger.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China manufactured 12.4 million electric cars in 2024, more than 70 percent of the 17.3 million electric cars manufactured globally last year.

Of these, China exported about 1.25 million cars, representing 40 percent of global exports, while the remaining Chinese-made cars — the vast majority — were sold domestically.

This dominance has been built on the back of “subsidies that China’s put in place to develop its industry, which I think is a very strategic thing that China has done, both for its own economic growth as well as decarbonisation”, Jaeger said.

But on the streets of the US or Canada, Chinese EVs are still relatively rare.

Why are Chinese EVs less affordable in the US and Canada?

According to Jaeger, “prohibitive” tariffs mean that Chinese EVs are almost impossible to buy in the US and Canada.

“In the last year, the US and Canada both put on basically completely prohibitive tariffs on EVs [of] over 100 percent in both places,” he added.

Notably, the steep import taxes on Chinese EVs in the US were introduced under Biden, a Democrat, who championed renewable energy, in contrast to Trump, who has pledged to fight it and “drill, baby, drill” for oil.

A month after the US introduced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in September 2024, Canada brought in identical tariffs of its own.

It means that a car that a Chinese EV manufacturer might be selling at $30,000 actually costs at least $60,000 in the US or Canada. This makes it hard for even cheaper Chinese models to compete with the higher-end US electric models, which on average retail for approximately $55,000.

These tariffs, along with other US policies, have meant that Chinese manufacturers have yet to set up shop in the US.

In Canada, Addisu Lashitew, an associate professor of business at McMaster University, told Al Jazeera that the steep tariffs conflict with targets set to transition fully to electric cars by 2035, but are also complicated due to Canada’s close trading ties with the US.

“The problem is that one, we are going through a very complex trade talk with the US now,” said Lashitew. “And two, our supply chain has also [been] very much integrated. Many of the American manufacturers are here, and Canadian firms are mainly suppliers.”

But while it is almost impossible to buy a cheap Chinese electric car in the US, Jaeger says this does not mean that North America is completely missing out on importing new Chinese technology.

“The US, for example, imports a lot of batteries from China. It’s actually the second-biggest importer of lithium-ion batteries behind Germany in the world, from China. So, they’re using them in US-made EVs,” he said.

Where can you buy cheap Chinese electric cars?

In contrast with the US and Canada, said Jaeger, many other countries have been more open to China’s EV market.

“You see different reactions from different countries, depending on their relationship with China, but mostly depending upon their domestic auto manufacturing presence,” he said.

Lashitew told Al Jazeera that Chinese exporters, including BYD as well as some smaller firms, are “targeting many emerging and developing countries”.

“Ironically, we’re in a situation where in the transportation sector, the energy transition is happening much faster in the Global South than in North America, at least.”

Chinese electric cars have also continued to sell well in many European countries, says Jaeger, despite those countries also imposing some tariffs, though lower than the US and Canada, “for what they see as unfair competitive practices in China”.

Still, while BYD has built factories in Japan, Hungary and India, as well as Brazil, its biggest presence remains in China, where the company was founded in Shenzhen in 1995. A majority of the 4.27 million electric cars that BYD sold in 2024 were bought by Chinese consumers. BYD also has a manufacturing presence in Lancaster, California, where it builds electric buses and batteries, but not cars.

In China, the local market has grown in part due to incentives from the government, which also saw electric cars as part of its strategy to bring down air pollution in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

Customers in China have benefitted from the government’s approach, including through access to new technology. For example, a new battery, which BYD announced in March with the promise of charging for 400km (about 250 miles) of travel in just five minutes, is first being made available for preorder to customers in China only.

How expensive are EVs?

They used to be costlier than cars that run on petrol or diesel. But according to the IEA, the cost of owning an electric car over the vehicle’s entire lifetime is now less than fossil fuel-powered cars, due to the reduced costs of fuel and maintenance.

Buying an electric car is still often more expensive, though.

That is where China’s subsidies to manufacturers help. The IEA has found that prices for electric cars in China are similar to petrol and diesel cars, with half of all electric cars being sold for less than $30,000 and a wide range of lower-priced models available.

By contrast, in the US and Europe, “the range [of available EVs] was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices”, according to the IEA.

Under Biden, the US tried to boost its domestic electric vehicle industry, while also trying to get the sector to reduce dependence on China.

Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced incentives for US manufacturers that did not use any Chinese parts. The IRA also introduced subsidies for consumers who bought EVs, though these have largely been overturned by Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which became law in July.

Nevertheless, even with the Biden-era incentives, only one in 10 cars sold in the US in 2024 was electric, while more than half of all new cars sold last year in China were electric.

Not just cars

While electric cars grab most headlines on sustainable transport, people are also increasingly turning to electric bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, buses and even trains in many parts of the world.

Even in the US, says Jaeger, there has been a significant growth in the number of electric scooters and two-wheelers imported from China.

According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), the US imported $1.5bn worth of electric two-wheelers from China in the 12 months up to September 2025, an increase of $275m — or more than 20 percent — from the previous year. Experts say that is because scooters are cheaper than cars, and because US tariffs on Chinese electric scooters are also lower than on electric cars.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the government has said it will ban petrol-powered motorbikes in the centre of its capital, Hanoi, from July next year, as part of a plan to tackle local air pollution.

According to the IEA, some 40 percent of bus sales are now electric in European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway.

There have also been increases in electric bus sales in Central and South America. In Mexico, for example, “close to 18 percent of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1 percent in 2023”, according to the IEA.

Still, the US continues to struggle here, too. Electric bus sales declined in 2024, according to the IEA, after the leading electric bus manufacturer went bankrupt and a second company stopped manufacturing in the US market after suffering sustained financial losses.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691d86ed82e35-1763542765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-20 19:02:10.114409

Also gone is the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has played a major role in promoting technologies like solar power.
“The Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore common sense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said in a statement announcing the reorganization.
The Trump administration has already frozen or canceled large amounts of Biden-era clean energy funding.
Over the past year, the Energy Department has lost roughly 20 percent of its work force — or 3,500 employees — amid a wave of firings, layoffs and incentives for retirement.","The Energy Department is breaking up or rebranding several offices that played key roles in the Biden administration’s push to develop clean energy technologies that could help address climate change.

A revised organizational chart posted by the agency on Tuesday no longer shows the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, or the Grid Deployment Office. Those offices had overseen billions of dollars in funding for batteries, hydrogen fuels and electrical grids, among other projects.

Also gone is the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has played a major role in promoting technologies like solar power. That office has been rebranded as the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation.

It is not yet clear how much of the work in these offices may be preserved or transferred elsewhere. But the overhaul reflects the priorities of the Trump administration, which has sought to dismantle Biden-era efforts to tackle global warming and encourage renewable energy and has instead focused on expanding fossil fuel production and prioritizing technologies like nuclear power.

“The Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore common sense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said in a statement announcing the reorganization.

The Trump administration has already frozen or canceled large amounts of Biden-era clean energy funding. In May, the Energy Department announced it was terminating $3.7 billion in awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That included natural gas and cement companies trying to capture and bury the carbon dioxide put out by their smokestacks.

In October, Mr. Wright announced he was canceling an additional $7.5 billion for hundreds of energy projects, mostly in states run by Democrats. That included funding for large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels as well as efforts to upgrade electrical grids and reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations.

An internal document has also been circulating among lawmakers suggesting that the agency is considering terminating $12 billion more, including funding for two large projects in Louisiana and Texas that aimed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Mr. Wright has said that he does not consider climate change one of the nation’s most pressing problems, as the Biden administration did. Instead, he has said he wants to prioritize energy sources that can run around the clock and help power data centers for artificial intelligence. That includes technologies like coal, natural gas, nuclear power and geothermal energy, as well as nascent fusion technology.

The reorganization reflects that shift.

For the first time in decades, the agency will no longer have an Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which was established in its current form in the 1990s and had overseen efforts to increase the energy efficiency of appliances and drive down the cost of solar panels.

The office will instead be renamed the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, which is expected to absorb some of the functions of the now-disbanded clean energy offices, according to two people familiar with the plans who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The reorganization also eliminates the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was established by Congress as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021 and focused on scaling up emerging technologies, such as advanced nuclear reactors or hydrogen fuels. That office had already lost the vast majority of its staff under the Trump administration.

Other Biden-era offices that were disbanded include: the Grid Deployment Office, which worked on upgrading the nation’s network of power lines; the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which had been working to establish a domestic battery industry; and the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, which helped support state efforts to improve energy efficiency.

The Trump administration is creating several new offices instead, including the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office as well as the Office of Fusion.

The agency’s high-profile Loan Programs Office, which provides billions of dollars in loans for promising technologies, will be renamed the Office of Energy Dominance Financing. Mr. Wright has said he mainly wants that office to bankroll new nuclear plants.

It is unclear whether the reorganization will lead to additional layoffs. Over the past year, the Energy Department has lost roughly 20 percent of its work force — or 3,500 employees — amid a wave of firings, layoffs and incentives for retirement.

As part of a deal to end the government shutdown this month, congressional Democrats secured a provision that barred further work force reductions at federal agencies until Jan. 30.

Kathleen Hogan, a former senior agency official who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, warned that reorganizations can be disruptive.

“Given the recent talent drain and other challenges, let’s hope for the sake of U.S. energy security, competitiveness and business certainty that this is a positive,” Ms. Hogan said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/20/multimedia/20cli-energy-cwjb/20cli-energy-cwjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:37.431341

The groups are represented by Troposphere Legal and Earthjustice.

In the filing, the groups assert that DTE has failed to support numerous claims related to purported costs and benefits of the data center project, including assurances that the massive influx in energy demand related to the data center would not increase costs to ratepayers. DTE has also failed to detail its plans to comply with Michigan’s nation-leading renewable energy standards and energy efficiency standards. In addition, DTE has redacted significant portions of the proposed contracts with the data center, thereby hiding such information from public review.

The MPSC earlier this week announced plans to hold a public comment forum on DTE's ex parte application, responding to public pressure to provide more transparency. This rushed forum – planned just two days before a previously planned MPSC meeting where DTE is reportedly pushing for a final decision – does not provide the proper forum for review on a project that would massively impact our energy grid.

“DTE and the MPSC cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence,” said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan Campaign Organizer for the Sierra Club. “If the company believes these contracts won’t raise bills or accelerate fossil dependence, it should welcome a contested case where its claims can be tested. Asking Michiganders to rely on informal assurances made on behalf of massive tech corporations as data centers across the country destabilize grids, derail climate plans, and drive up costs is indefensible.”

A contested case hearing is needed in order for Sierra Club and other groups to effectively conduct discovery, evaluate DTE’s application, and advocate for Michiganders who will be directly impacted by this project.

Additional statements from Sierra Club, NRDC, and CUB:

""DTE is asking the Commission to approve one of the largest energy deals in our state without providing the evidence needed to show it will not raise bills or shift major risks onto Michigan families. A project of this scale deserves a full and open review,” said Derrell Slaughter, Michigan Policy Director for Climate and Energy at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “A contested case gives the public and independent experts the chance to verify the costs, assess the clean energy needs, and make sure the commitments being made add up. While economic growth is good, we owe it to Michiganders to get the details right and protect ratepayers every step of the way.”

“Transparency is not optional. Under Michigan law, the MPSC cannot approve utility requests that will result in increased costs for ratepayers without giving other interested parties an opportunity to fully participate in the proceeding,” said Elena Saxonhouse, a managing attorney with the Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program. “The MPSC risks setting a dangerous precedent allowing a rushed approval process for a data center proposal of this magnitude. With so many data center proposals on the way, and so many questions about how each project will impact already high utility bills for Michiganders, the MPSC cannot allow utilities to rush through contract approvals without scrutiny.”

""Too much is at stake in this data center case for it not to be fully contested,"" said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan. ""DTE customers already pay some of the highest residential rates in the country, and this contract needs to be fully vetted to ensure it doesn't exacerbate the affordability problem.""",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:55.254895

BACKGROUND

Biotechnology will shape how the U.S. defends itself, secures its food supply, and cures life-threatening diseases. NSCEB warned that without rapid and significant investment, the U.S. will fall behind its global competitors, specifically China.

The Biomanufacturing Excellence Act would additionally establish a public-private center dedicated to advancing biopharmaceutical manufacturing – a key recommendation from the NSCEB report.

Specifically, the National Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Center of Excellence would:

Unite industry professionals with academic researchers to conduct collaborative research on new technology for scaling biopharmaceutical manufacturing

Host a facility that replicates industrial manufacturing conditions and complies with Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations, where innovators would develop and test new manufacturing processes

Identify challenges and opportunities for scaling biopharmaceutical manufacturing, especially for products important to U.S. national security, public health, and economic security

Train tomorrow’s biopharmaceutical manufacturing workforce by partnering with educational, industry, and community leaders to bolster biotechnology talent

“Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.” Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act.","The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday.

The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.

The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.

In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.

Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute.

Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.

The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.

“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”

The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”

The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.

Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate.

“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.

The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say.

Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said.

State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary.

“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”

Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas.

“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”

Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.

More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou.

“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”

“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/5.-Elise-Plunk-IMG_9859-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 18:02:22.124815

Research firm IDTechEx’s latest study “Li-ion Battery Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Applications, Outlooks and Forecasts” indicates that global annual battery production capacity will reach 5.4 TWh in the next decade, rising from 500 GWh reported in 2020.

According to the report, more than 50% of that capacity will be centralized in China. As of 2024, China controlled more than 75% of total global battery production capacity, due to fast development of gigafactories and subsidization by governmental bodies.

Major players in terms of lithium-ion cell suppliers include CATL, BYD and Gotion in China; LG Chem and Samsung SDI in Korea; Panasonic in Japan and more, with Panasonic and LG Chem generally focusing on the North American and European markets. The top six players account for more than 65% of the global total sales in 2025, and CATL alone accounted for 37% of global lithium-ion battery sales in 2024, according to IDTechEx.

In 2025, the global production capacity of lithium-Ion batteries was more than 2,500 GWh. However, development of a gigafactory is a multi-year project, requiring significant investment – in the order of $50-$100 million USD per GWh. Plans and timelines are often subject to delays and cancellations, especially outside of China, where generally slower growth in electric vehicles and energy storage system markets have led to less demand than initially forecast, resulting in more limited funds for gigafactory development.

Tensions with China have also led to delays and cancellations in gigafactory plans, especially in the United States. IDTechEx has tracked gigafactory development across the world, and notes several delays and cancellations related to geopolitical tensions.

Examples include LG’s Lansing facility, which was initially meant to be a joint venture with GM Motors that would start production in 2025. As the venture with GM fell through, LG is now looking for other partners to develop the facility. Gotion has also experienced difficulties in expanding a gigafactory in Michigan, due to conflict with locals. While the facility was initially green-lighted by a local mayor, suspicions regarding the company’s Chinese origins resulted in a legal and political battle in the town of Big Rapids, which have delayed Gotion’s plans significantly.

Northvolt is another player whose gigafactory plans have seen delays – the company has fallen into bankruptcy and many of its facilities have stopped production. While Lyten, a lithium-sulfur developer, has made moves to acquire Northvolt’s American and European facilities, this represents a delay to lithium-ion battery production rollout in both regions.

However, global production capacity is still set to almost double over the next decade, with gigafactories in the United States and Europe taking a larger percentage of the global total.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard.
The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule.
In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months.","On October 11, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a final rule pursuant to section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) imposing a one-time reporting obligation on entities that manufactured (including imported) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at any time between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022, to the extent the information is “known or reasonably ascertainable.” “Manufacture” is defined to mean manufacture (including import) “for a commercial purpose.” Information required to be reported includes company and plant site information, chemical-specific information, categories of use, manufactured amounts, by-product reporting, environmental and health effects, worker exposure data, and disposal data; reporting is required on a chemical-specific basis and for each “site” where the chemical is manufactured/imported. This rule is the direct result of a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2020, which required EPA to require reporting by PFAS manufacturers. EPA therefore did not have flexibility with respect to whether to finalize the rule; they did, however, have discretion with respect to the scope of the rule, including whether to apply exemptions found in other TSCA contexts (for example, exemptions for article importers, the manufacture of by-products and impurities, and manufacture for research and development (R&D) purposes). Despite overwhelming public comment regarding the need for such exemptions, EPA declined to apply any of these exemptions in the 2023 final rule.

Application to “Chemical Substances”; Exclusion of FDA-Regulated Substances – The PFAS reporting rule applies to “chemical substances,” which is defined by TSCA § 3 to exclude “any food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device (as such terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device.” As a general matter, the rule’s direct impact on companies working under FDA oversight, including those in the drug, biologics, food, medical device, and cosmetics sectors, may be relatively limited. Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule. For example, applicability of the exemption is less clear when PFAS are produced (or PFAS/PFAS-containing articles are imported) for multiple end uses.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard. Data reported under the rule (unless covered by a valid and timely confidential business information (CBI) claim) will be publicly available and available to competitors, advocacy groups, and plaintiffs’ attorneys.

The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window

EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule. Specifically, in a November 13, 2025 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA announced that it is proposing to exempt the following “manufacture” from the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activity under the rule:

Import of PFAS in articles

PFAS in mixtures or articles below 0.1% (a “de minimis” exemption)

Manufacture of PFAS as by-products, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates and

Manufacture (including import) of PFAS in small quantities for R&D purposes (specifically, in such “quantities of a chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured, imported, or processed solely for research and development that are not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes”)

EPA has also proposed changing the reporting window. Currently, the reporting window is currently set to open April 13, 2026; most reporting entities have 6 months to report, except that small manufacturers that are required to report only because of their import of PFAS-containing articles have a full year. In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months. (Because, under the proposal, article importers would not be required to report, there would be no need for a longer reporting window for small manufacturer article importers.)

Next Steps and Looking Ahead

EPA will accept comments on the proposal through December 29, 2025. Companies should evaluate potential obligations under the existing rule and whether the proposed revisions align with operational and strategic priorities; consider submitting comments to individually or through industry associations to ensure relevant stakeholder perspectives are reflected in the administrative record.

The TSCA PFAS reporting rulemaking highlights the breadth of federal PFAS oversight, as well as the growing intersection between EPA’s PFAS-focused initiatives and the FDA’s ongoing oversight of chemicals and materials used in food and medical products. Parallel monitoring of both agencies’ regulatory initiatives is essential to effectively manage compliance, supply chain transparency, and associated liability considerations.",https://www.venable.com/assets/images/favicon.png,N,,2025-11-20 19:59:32.332074

Duke Energy (DUK) has submitted proposals to the North Carolina Utilities Commission seeking to adjust rates for its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities. The company aims for a $1 billion annual revenue increase, with Duke Energy Carolinas targeting $727 million in 2027 and $275 million in 2028, translating to a 15% revenue rise. Duke Energy Progress requests an increase of $729 million, broken down into $528 million for 2027 and $200 million for 2028, marking a 15.1% rise.

The basis for these requests is a 10.95% return on equity, alongside a 53% equity capital structure, pending regulatory approval. Duke Energy anticipates its nuclear operations will yield substantial tax credits through 2032, with the current rates facilitating a $150 million return in nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Carolinas customers for 2025-2026. Additionally, the company plans to expand these credits to Duke Energy Progress customers and incorporate solar and hydro tax credits for both utilities.

The proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress is projected to result in customer savings exceeding $1 billion. Moreover, self-healing technology has minimized customer outages by over 1.1 million incidents in the first 10 months of 2025, saving nearly 2.6 million hours of downtime.

Duke Energy Corp, one of the largest US utilities, operates regulated utilities in the Carolinas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky, delivering electricity to more than 8 million customers. Its natural gas utilities serve more than 1.6 million customers. With a market capitalization of approximately $95.3 billion, Duke Energy is a significant player in the Utilities sector, specifically within the Utilities - Regulated industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Duke Energy's financial health is underscored by its consistent revenue growth and robust profitability metrics:

Revenue growth over the past three years stands at 7.1%.

The company boasts a operating margin of 27.11% and a net margin of 15.76%.

Its EBITDA margin is an impressive 52.5%.

However, the balance sheet reveals some areas of concern:

The current ratio is 0.63, indicating potential liquidity issues.

A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.74 suggests a high level of leverage.

The Altman Z-Score of 0.72 places the company in the distress zone, implying a possibility of financial distress.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Duke Energy's valuation metrics provide insights into its market positioning:

The P/E ratio is 19.27, close to its 5-year low, suggesting potential undervaluation.

The P/S ratio of 3.02 is near its 3-year high, indicating a premium valuation.

The P/B ratio of 1.89 is close to its 10-year high, reflecting market confidence.

Analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $136.17 and a recommendation score of 2.5. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 41.13 suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Risk Assessment

While Duke Energy demonstrates strong operational metrics, several risks warrant attention:

The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.41 is below the preferred threshold, indicating potential challenges in meeting interest obligations.

Sector-specific risks include regulatory changes and environmental concerns.

The beta of 0.25 suggests lower volatility compared to the market, providing some stability.

Overall, Duke Energy's strategic initiatives, including rate adjustments and tax credit utilization, position it for potential growth, albeit with financial and sector-specific risks that require careful monitoring.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000B1C.png?20,N,,2025-11-20 18:01:42.490630

She lingered near locked gates posted with warnings to keep out of the “hazardous substance area,” where long-shuttered chemical plants had dumped toxic waste on marshlands, and recounted the refinery explosion that changed her life.

Angulo was just 12 years old when a massive explosion rocked Chevron’s accident-prone Richmond refinery, four miles up the road. Towering clouds of black smoke darkened the skies for hours that summer day in 2012, forcing 15,000 residents to seek medical care for chest pain, headaches and asthma, among other ailments.

The catastrophic fire haunts the collective memory of this working-class town, where industrial accidents regularly plague largely Black and Latino neighborhoods surrounded by polluting railroads, deepwater ports and freeways. It also turned a generation of young people into climate activists.

“That fire was a big catalyst for a lot of us,” said Angulo, now 25, who co-founded the climate justice group led by gender-queer activists called Rich City Rays and organizes non-violent protests against Chevron, the second-largest greenhouse gas emitter in California.

Angulo, a first-generation Mexican-American, grew up with asthma. But she didn’t connect her breathing problems to Richmond’s rampant pollution until the refinery fire left so many gasping for air. Now she sees the oil-storage tanks blanketing the hills beyond her mother’s kitchen window as “symbols of harm along the hillside.”

And experts worry that the health costs of living in a heavily polluted city could reverberate for generations if little is done to curb heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. That’s because surging seas will increase flood risks for hazardous sites in Richmond and other overburdened cities along U.S. coasts, scientists at the University of California, China’s Nanjing University and Climate Central, a nonprofit science organization, warn in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications.

Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color face a disproportionate share of the risk, they found.

Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental-health disparities expert at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author on the study, has spent the past several years evaluating climate pollution’s likely impacts on low-lying industrial regions and vulnerable populations.

Burning fossil fuels makes flooding not only more destructive, by destabilizing the climate and supercharging waves, storms and high tides, but also more dangerous, by releasing toxic substances like petroleum and untreated sewage in the path of roiling floodwaters.

Morello-Frosch worries that toxic floodwaters are more likely to imperil low-income communities of color like Richmond because decades of discriminatory housing, lending and employment practices have left residents stuck living near polluting industries without the means to mitigate harm when disaster strikes.

To help communities and policymakers prepare for future threats, the research team conducted the first national assessment of unequal risks from flooded hazardous sites related to sea level rise. Of nearly 48,000 U.S. facilities that store, handle, produce or release harmful substances, they identified 5,500 that are likely to experience a 1-in-100-year flood event—that is, an uncommonly large flood that has a 1 percent chance of happening in any year—by 2100. Nearly 3,800 sites are likely to flood by 2050.

Curbing emissions would spare a few hundred sites by 2100, the team found. But past climate pollution has “locked in” projected flood risks over the short term.

“Over 5,000 facilities are projected to be at risk of a 1-in-100-year flooding event in 2100 if we don’t do anything, and we just learned that we’re failing to meet the 1.5 degree Celsius benchmark,” said Morello-Frosch, referring to the Paris Agreement target to avoid potentially irreversible effects of climate change.

About two dozen coastal states plus Puerto Rico are likely to see at least some hazardous facilities flood. But the vast majority of at-risk facilities are concentrated in just seven states. Topping the list is Louisiana, with its dense concentration of oil and gas wells, followed by Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York and Massachusetts.

Oil and gas wells and industrial facilities that emit toxic chemicals tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory together make up nearly 70 percent of sites likely to flood by century’s end. Other facilities include sewage treatment plants; ports and terminals that import, export and store fossil fuels; former defense sites; and power plants.

Exposure to toxic substances like pathogen-laden raw sewage, industrial chemicals and hydrocarbons has been linked to numerous short- and long-term health conditions, including heart problems, cancer and respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin conditions, risks that can persist for residents and clean-up workers long after floodwaters recede.

Overburdened communities like Richmond, where poverty and other social stressors exacerbate environmental exposures, are 50 percent more likely to be within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of a hazardous site at risk of flooding by century’s end, the new study found. Hispanic residents, single parents, nonvoters, renters, people over 65, and those in poverty, without access to a vehicle or with limited English skills are up to 41 percent more likely to live near an at-risk site.

“Ideally we would have a federal government that was enabling communities to plan and respond and proactively address these risks,” Morello-Frosch said. “But right now, these states are left to their own devices,” she said, referring to the Trump administration’s massive cuts to federal disaster relief and related programs.

And as it becomes increasingly difficult to access federal resources and data, including datasets used in this study, she said, states are going to have a harder time addressing future threats.

“A Legacy of State-Sponsored Racism”

Angulo studied a map showing nearly two dozen hazardous sites likely to flood in her hometown: Superfund and cleanup sites like the one at the marsh, fossil fuel ports, chemical manufacturers, a sewage treatment plant and the Chevron refinery, which emitted most of the 812,000 pounds of toxic chemicals, heavy metals and carcinogens released last year by Richmond’s industrial facilities.

An elementary school, Peres K-8, where children play downwind of the refinery next to a major freeway, lies within a half mile of two chemical plants likely to flood.

“A petroleum pipeline runs right under the sidewalk in front of the school,” Angulo said.

The new study excludes pipelines despite their vulnerability during severe floods, the authors said, because national data on pipeline locations is limited.

Angulo was not surprised to see the concentration of at-risk industrial sites around the Iron Triangle, where less than 10 percent of residents are white, and North Richmond, a small unincorporated community where 96 percent of residents are people of color.

“It’s a legacy of state-sponsored racism and state-sponsored segregation,” Angulo said, referring to federal housing policies that, until passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, considered people of color threats to property values.

Around Richmond, Angulo said, “neighborhoods like North Richmond and the Iron Triangle were historically the only places Black and brown folks were allowed to own houses.”

Even though Black migrants fleeing the Jim Crow South helped Richmond build more warships than any other U.S. shipyard during World War II, they were denied access to government-insured loans and had to resort to makeshift construction materials. “That’s why Parchester Village was built,” she said.

Parchester Village, promoted as a “community for all Americans,” was surrounded by heavy industry and flanked by two railways.

Thomasina Horsley grew up in Parchester Village, where heavy rains inundated the housing tract soon after it was built in 1949. Her mother, Margaret, one of Parchester’s original residents, remembers floodwaters rushing from one end of the neighborhood to the other.

Engineers warned county officials in the 1950s that a “dangerous mixture of oil and water” would pass through Parchester if a storage tank up the hill in the “tank farm” run by Chevron’s predecessor, Standard Oil, were to burst during a storm.

Parchester’s flooding problems were compounded after developers removed a eucalyptus grove on a hill near the old tank farm about five years ago to build million-dollar homes, Horsley said. Without the trees to catch water during heavy rains, she said, “there’s water all over.”

The city is working to fix the problem, just one of many in a city of ever-present dangers.

“We’ve had so many bad things happen, people just go into survival mode,” said Horsley.

Like the time in 1993 when a railroad tank car at a now-defunct chemical company released a miles-long cloud of sulfuric acid over homes, sending 24,000 to local hospitals and leading to a $180 million class-action settlement.

“There’s always these tanks around with something leaking,” Horsley said. “Then we get the downwinds all the time with all these chemicals coming from Chevron. You smell them all the time.”

Living near some of California’s biggest pollution sources has created and exacerbated residents’ health problems.

People who have asthma are more sensitive to chemical emissions, but they’re living near some of the highest emissions while lacking access to healthcare, Angulo said. “It’s just like a triple whammy of harm.”

Both Angulo and her sister grew up with asthma, but their brother, who grew up in Mexico rather than Richmond, did not. Plus, there’s no history of asthma in their family. “It’s a clear signal that growing up here is what did it,” she said.

About 25 percent of Richmond residents have asthma, compared to 13 percent of California residents. Asthma emergency department visits in the Iron Triangle are higher than 99 percent of California census tracts, state data shows.

So many people are already suffering from industry’s noxious releases, Angulo said. How are they supposed to handle even more toxic threats from rising seas when they have nowhere else to go?

“Blatant Neglect”

Doria Robinson, a third-generation Richmond native who serves on the city council, runs a community food project called Urban Tilth in North Richmond. The farm, which hires and trains local residents to support a healthier community, sits half a mile from a sewage plant likely to flood.

Two creeks flank the farm, which regularly saw “massive flooding” until about a decade ago, when the county raised their levees, Robinson said, pointing beyond rows of leafy greens and flowers as roosters crowed behind her.

“But now we’re in a new regime with climate change and storm events that are just unheard of, like atmospheric rivers,” she said, referring to powerful storms that have become even stronger as the world warms. “How many record-breaking storm events can you have in a season that are supposed to come every 100 years?”

Robinson helped the city negotiate a deal in which Chevron agreed to pay Richmond $500 million over the next 10 years instead of tens of millions each year in a “polluters pay” refinery tax.

“For us to have a multinational, multibillion-dollar corporation right here in our backyard with the amount of disinvestment in the community, the amount of deferred investment in our infrastructure, the built environment that makes up this city is just,” Robinson said, pausing to find the right words, “just blatant neglect.”

Chevron is an essential part of Richmond’s and the region’s economy, contributing over $1 billion in economic activity annually, Caitlin Powell, a spokesperson for the Richmond refinery, said in a statement. “Our recent agreement with the city underscores the essential nature of our relationship with the city, and we hope the associated additional funding will be used responsibly and transparently to help our Richmond community flourish.”

Robinson wants the Chevron tax settlement funds to go toward reversing decades of lack of investment. “I strongly believe that we need to focus on these types of threats that are only going to be exacerbated by climate change, and put some resources toward trying to figure out how to get ahead of them,” she said.

She’s particularly worried about how rising seas will affect hazardous waste sites that were “cleaned up” by capping the soil with concrete and asphalt.

When Robinson thinks about sea level rise, she thinks about saltwater pushing groundwater up against those caps, inundating toxic soils and carrying contaminants into old, poorly maintained sewer pipes that run under houses, parks and schools.

“We’ve got an old DDT factory and all these other things where supposedly a cap was gonna save us,” she said. “Our grand plan to use these massive caps is totally undermined by intrusion of water underground.”

Threats From Below

Robinson first heard about the threat of rising coastal groundwater from researchers at UC Berkeley who were not involved in the new study.

Emma Lasky, a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, and her Ph.D. advisor, Kristina Hill, study the likelihood that groundwater will rise along with sea level and dislodge contaminants at hazardous sites capped with materials like concrete.

“When we thought of the problem as rain spreading the contaminant through infiltration, it made sense and it sounded cost effective,” said Hill, referring to the concrete cap. “It was like putting an umbrella over the contaminant.”

But now, said Hill, associate professor of landscape architecture and environmental planning at UC Berkeley, “we see that it’s about water rising up from below and even changing flow directions.”

As dense saltwater moves inland, studies show, it slides under and pushes groundwater toward the surface, where it can mobilize contaminants once sequestered in groundwater and soil.

Lasky is looking at how seasonal variability in precipitation affects the concentration and movement of toxics like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the contaminated Richmond marsh. Lasky and Hill think VOCs, which can prove harmful even at low levels, may be moving through sewer pipes, which can ferry volatile chemicals thousands of feet, and entering homes through broken toilet seals, shower drains or cracks in home foundations.

To understand how rising waters might affect VOCs, Lasky placed sampling devices on sewer laterals, which connect main sewer lines to buildings, to compare the chemicals’ concentrations during the dry season and after atmospheric rivers, which served as a proxy for sea level rise.

So far Lasky has found a chlorinated VOC linked to several cancers at higher concentrations during the rainy season. The finding suggests that an influx of VOC-tainted water, whether from heavy rains or surging seas, could enter cracks in sewer systems and seep into buildings.

Lasky hasn’t tested for VOCs in homes served by the sewer that runs through the marsh yet. But she’s concerned that, if she finds them, people may not have the money to make repairs. She’s even more concerned that most people don’t even know about the problem.

Lasky and Hill are doing their best to sound the alarm.

Since high tides and heavy rains can raise groundwater enough to mobilize contaminants, Hill said, “the impact of sea level rise is really a game of inches, not of feet.”

And that’s a major concern for coastal sites as contaminated as the Richmond shoreline.

The marsh usually floods with heavy rains, Angulo said. “Baxter Creek runs right through all of this super-toxic land,” she said, pointing beyond the fence posted with “keep out” signs. “All of the rainwater, all the ocean water that flows back up, gets mixed in with all the chemicals in the dirt.”

The creek flows through people’s backyards on the other side of the freeway in a public housing complex. “It’s a majority Black, brown and low-income community, which as we know are the most at-risk when it comes to health impacts,” she said. And now, when bigger and bigger rains come and sea level continues to rise with climate change, she added, they’re sitting on a “ticking time bomb.”

Resilience Denied

As the rate of sea level rise continues to accelerate, scientists expect to see rapid increases in the frequency of flooding from high tides along U.S. coastlines as soon as the next decade.

Still, compared to an extreme weather event like a hurricane, sea level rise is relatively slow-moving, giving states and municipalities time to prepare, said Morello-Frosch.

She hopes agencies use the study results to prioritize resources for communities facing significant threats by doing more site-specific assessments, looking at other hazardous facilities like pipelines, accounting for rising groundwater and supporting more resilience planning.

The results can also help vulnerable communities advocate for incorporating sea level projections into cleanup plans for hazardous sites, she said.

Urban Tilth’s Robinson was trying to address how climate change might multiply the dangers of North Richmond’s industrial hazards when she helped secure a $19 million Community Change Grant from the Biden administration’s EPA.

“The grant was going to be a major investment in an area that has just taken the brunt and carried the burden of fossil fuel impacts for 100 years,” Robinson said.

The North Richmond Resilience Initiative was one of more than 400 grants funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that the Trump administration canceled in March. It would have created green space at the elementary school near the at-risk wastewater treatment plant to filter pollutants from a massive warehouse being built next door. It would have transformed an abandoned public housing project into affordable, energy-efficient homes. It would have created a community disaster response hub at Urban Tilth, among other projects.

When California Reps. John Garamendi and Mark DeSaulnier urged the EPA to reinstate the congressionally mandated appropriations, they were told the initiative funds programs that “promote or take part in DEI or environmental justice,” undercutting the agency’s priority “to eliminate discrimination” in its programs.

The EPA press office did not respond to a request to point out discriminatory programs in the grant.

Robinson was shocked when she saw the EPA’s reason for canceling the grant. The grant was trying to address a long history of compounding threats focusing on the geography of North Richmond, not on specific populations, Robinson said. “It’s literally the design of the grant to be geographic.”

That geography supported the growth of heavy industry that still dominates Richmond long after its industrial heyday and continues to take a toll on residents’ health.

Back at the contaminated marsh, Angulo recalled that she and her friends didn’t think about the long-term impacts of living in an industrial town when they were younger. As if on cue, a siren blared in the distance.

A siren goes off every Wednesday to make sure the community warning system is working in case a disaster strikes. For Angulo, it’s a constant reminder of that clear blue day in 2012 when massive clouds of black smoke blotted out the sun and stole her innocence.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1140741-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:59:22.348220

From hurricanes to economic challenges, our state has faced adversity time and again, proving that we can rise, adapt and rebuild.

But the next chapter of resilience isn’t just about recovery; it’s about readiness. True resilience means anticipating challenges before they happen. At Entergy Louisiana, we believe that by planning ahead, strengthening grid infrastructure and investing in innovation, we can deliver reliable power to our communities no matter what.

Entergy Louisiana is investing an average of $380 million per year from 2024 through 2028 to upgrade approximately 3,240 miles of distribution and transmission lines and an estimated 62,000 structures. These upgrades reinforce our system to better withstand high winds, floods, ice storms, fires and other extreme events, ensuring reliable service when Louisiana needs it most.

Investing in grid hardening ahead of storms is not just about reliability—it’s also the most cost-effective approach. Upfront resilience investments reduce long-term costs for customers by preventing widespread damage, shortening outages, and avoiding the much higher expense of emergency restoration after a major storm. Every dollar spent proactively helps keep future costs down and protects the communities we serve.

By combining strong infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, Entergy is not only strengthening reliability today but preparing Louisiana’s grid for tomorrow. As industries, businesses and households demand more consistent, high-quality power, our modernization efforts ensure the grid can support that growth and keep Louisiana competitive.

These grid enhancements also support the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, key components of building a more sustainable energy network for the state. The ability to balance traditional energy sources with renewables is what will enable Louisiana to meet its energy needs in a sustainable way.

For generations, Louisianians have understood resilience as the ability to recover quickly from difficulties. But it is also the capacity to withstand, to remain steady and unaffected when tested.

We’re being proactive by designing systems that can operate through natural disasters, economic shifts and other challenges without disruption. Every investment we make in grid modernization, every upgrade to our infrastructure and every partnership we pursue is part of a shared commitment to keep the lights on.

Across Wisconsin, between 43 percent and 90 percent of the state’s 3.7 million acres of wetlands are at risk of losing protections.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

On Monday, the U.S. EPA and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a set of new rules that would leave millions of acres of wetlands, small waterbodies, and ephemeral streams across the country unprotected — threatening the drinking water of millions of Americans and leaving crucial habitat and floodplains susceptible to filling.

These proposed changes were anticipated by many. Their groundwork was laid in 2022, when the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that the Clean Water Act’s protections only applied to bodies of water that maintained a continuous surface connection to traditional, navigable waters — a rigid order that is incompatible with the naturally fluctuating connectivity of many crucial watersheds.

Under the Trump Administration’s push for a new era of energy dominance, it was only a matter of time before the Supreme Court’s precedent was adopted into federal code.

“When finalized, the rule will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act,” a statement from the EPA reads.

In March, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) analyzed the potential impacts of this very scenario.

The non-profit estimated that between 38 million and 70 million acres of wetlands across the country — up to 90 percent of its total wetlands — would become exposed to filling, dredging, and pollution under federal actions similar to those proposed on Monday.

No states stand to potentially lose more than Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Even in the least damaging of the three regulatory scenarios NRDC modeled — categorized as “Damaging,” “More Damaging,” and “Most Damaging” — they were the only states to lose protections for more than 1 million acres of wetlands.

By one token, the vulnerability of wetlands in these three states is a simple function of existence — the more habitat they have, the more they stand to lose.

In Context: The Next Deluge May Go Differently

Compared to the rest of the Great Lakes basin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have retained the greatest share of their historic wetlands: roughly 50 percent each. By contrast, Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana have each already lost between 85 percent and 90 percent of these ecosystems since pre-colonization.

Regionally, these risks are concentrated to three specific areas: shoreline along Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, woodland bogs in northern Minnesota, and the agricultural communities of the Wisconsin River watershed.

In each, the potential erosion of wetlands — often called “nature’s kidneys” for their ability to filter pollutants and absorb excess water — means the impacts of existing and looming climate changes are likely to worsen.

Wetter Winters In Delta County, Michigan

According to NRDC data, between 31 percent (Damaging) and 95 percent (Most Damaging) of Michigan’s 3.8 million acres of wetlands are vulnerable to lost protections.

The largest share of these at-risk wetlands, nearly 210,000 acres, is in Delta County, which hugs the northern shore of Lake Michigan in the state’s Upper Peninsula. One-fifth of the county’s properties are at risk of flooding over the next 30 years, a figure that will likely increase if floodplains — nature’s best buffer against extreme storm and river surges — are lost.

The area is home to parts of the Hiawatha National Forest and Escanaba River State Forest.

According to Delta County’s 2023 Hazard Mitigation Plan, the county’s 211 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline are most vulnerable to flooding as a result of fluctuating water levels, snowmelt, and seiches. By the latter half of the century, winter and spring rains are expected to intensify by at least 20 percent.

“The Escanaba and Gladstone municipal harbors are at lower elevations than nearby residential structures; future lakeshore flooding damage may also be localized in these areas,” the report reads.

Exacerbating the loss of protections is how much the area has to gain from dedicated conservation. Maps created by the Michigan Department of Environment, Energy, and Great Lakes forecast that much of Delta County’s shoreline, especially along the Bays De Noc, have the potential to reap the highest measurable benefits from wetland restoration.

Wildfire Risks In Koochiching and St. Louis Counties, Minnesota

No state in the Lower-48 has more regulatory wetlands than Minnesota, with nearly 11 million acres. Between 59 percent and 83 percent of these would be left unprotected by the Clean Water Act, according to NRDC data.

The largest swaths lay just west of Lake Superior’s shores, in Koochiching and St. Louis counties, where under the “Most Damaging” NRDC scenario more than 2 million acres of wetlands, primarily forest bogs, would be left exposed.

These vulnerabilities coincide with the region — home to several state forests, Superior National Forest, and Voyageurs National Park — experiencing more intense wildfire seasons. This May, the Brimson Complex wildfires burned more than 29,000 acres in and around St. Louis County as moderate drought conditions set in across the northern half of the state.

“We are trending toward hotter, drier weather, and that is going to change the fire situation,” Sarah Strommen, head of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told the New York Times this summer. “It is hard to compare what has been historically the normal fire season pattern in the state of Minnesota and what we’re seeing now and going forward.”

For up to five years after wildfire, the risk of flooding is significantly higher. Vegetation loss, charred ground, and dry soils allow for rainwater to flow rapidly across the landscape — surges that wetlands, which naturally absorb excess water, do well to mitigate.

Warming temperatures also mean that the number of days in northeastern Minnesota with snow cover is expected to fall by between 14 and 19 days, resulting in a wildfire season that will begin earlier and stretch later.

By 2040, according to state data, at least one-third of the region’s population is expected to be 65 years-old or older, leaving communities especially vulnerable to the impacts of flooding, wildfire, and heat and precipitation changes.

Agricultural Pollution In Marathon County, Wisconsin

Home to the Wisconsin River watershed in the state’s interior, agricultural Marathon County faces acute threats to its groundwater quality — a challenge now doubly threatened by the county’s potential to lose protections for up to 167,365 acres of its wetlands, making it Wisconsin’s most vulnerable region.

Home to more than 2,000 farms, the county’s water quality is in dire straits. A draft of its 2026 Comprehensive Plan identifies nonpoint runoff pollution as one of its most pressing concerns, and its Farmland Preservation Plan plainly states that “the area’s biggest challenge is surface water quality issues.”

Multiple waterways across the county — spanning the Rib River, Big Eau Pleine River, and Little Eau Pleine River watersheds — remain listed as phosphorus-impaired by the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The county’s wells were also hotspots for nitrate contamination, as analyzed by an Alliance for the Great Lakes report published this September.

In Wausau, the county’s most populated city, PFAS contamination also remains an ongoing concern. Between 2019 and 2022, all water samples measured from the city’s six wells contained levels of forever chemicals that exceeded local health service standards.

In recent studies, constructed wetlands and fungi have shown promise as nature-based solutions to filtering PFAS from running waterways.

Overall, Duke Energy reported record annual revenue of $30 billion in 2024 for its six-state region.
Duke Energy is shooting for annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% over the next few years, CEO Harry Sideris said in November.","Duke Energy is asking state regulators to approve an increase of more than 13% in its rates in 2027 for residential customers, with business customers likely to see smaller increases.

The requests continue a trend of sharply higher electricity costs over the past decade. Residential rates in the U.S. climbed 32% in the last decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, outpacing the overall inflation rate.

The utility says customers in the Charlotte and Triad areas using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would pay about $17 more per month starting Jan. 1, 2027, an increase to about $162 per month. It is also proposing a nearly 4% increase in 2028, putting the monthly bill at about $168.50.

Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 8.7% and 3.9% while industrial customers would see hikes of 6.3% and 3.4%.

In Duke’s eastern North Carolina region, the average residential customer would see a $23 increase to about $187 a month, then another $6.59 a month in 2028. In those two years, commercial customers would see an average increase of 9.2% and 4.6%, while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 7.4% and 4.3%.

The N.C. Utilities Commission will study the rate increases, which Duke says would boost revenue by about $1.78 billion over the two years in its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress divisions. The company is planning to merge the units, which have remained distinct from a regulatory basis since Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged in 2012. Overall, Duke Energy reported record annual revenue of $30 billion in 2024 for its six-state region.

Regulators require the utility to balance the needs of ratepayers and investors while maintaining a reliable energy grid. “It’s important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers,” Kendal Bowman, Duke’s North Carolina president, said in a release.

Duke and other utilities are planning record capital investments over the next decade to boost generation capacity because of demand for power from manufacturers, electric vehicles and data centers that enable AI computing.

“The cost of electricity is skyrocketing,” says Kevin Martin of the Carolinas Utility Customers Association, a Raleigh group representing businesses. “Load growth is coming on and not just data centers. There’s also population growth and utilities have to build infrastructure and increase transmission and distribution systems.”

It’s typical for the Utilities Commission to reduce Duke’s rate request following testimony by his and other groups, Martin notes. That debate often centers on the amount of profit sought by the utility.

If approved, the rates would enable Duke to earn a return on equity of 10.95%, the company said. The average return on equity in 2024 for electricity and natural gas utilities was 9.7%, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Nationally, policymakers and regulators appear supportive of utilities, “creating a favorable backdrop for the strongest rate base and earnings growth outlook the sector has seen in decades,” analyst Timothy Winter of New York-based Gabelli Funds said in a July research report. “Notably, rising electric demand enables utilities to spread infrastructure costs over a larger customer base, helping to mitigate affordability concerns.”

But utilities have to execute effectively by raising funds, building infrastructure and managing costs to hit their profit goals, Winter noted.

Duke Energy is shooting for annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% over the next few years, CEO Harry Sideris said in November. Duke’s shares have returned an average 11.6% over the past three years, including dividends. That compares with a 20.3% return by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF over the same period.

Over the last decade, Duke said rates have increased more for residential customers than business ones because the utility has invested heavily in upgrading its distribution grid. Moreover, shifting weather trends mean Duke plans its generation needs around the winter peak, versus a summer peak historically, and residential heating needs account for a significant part of the winter peak. Regulators require the company to charge customer classes based on its costs, spokesman Bill Norton said.

Duke faces inflationary pressures like all businesses. “From transformers to poles to power lines, material costs have increased dramatically over the last few years,” Norton says. He notes prices for essential grid items such as transmission crossarms, distribution transformers and voltage regulators have more than doubled over the past five years. Duke’s size enables it to negotiate better prices than smaller utilities, but material prices have climbed substantially, he adds.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Duke-Energy-Transmission-lines.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:52.270596

11/20/2025 - 04:29 PM

Targeted investments will harden the grid against storms and upgrade existing power plants to maximize efficiency, saving customers money

New energy infrastructure will support rapid growth from increasing population, advanced manufacturing and data centers – with customer protections built in

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed requests with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) for revised rates at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, its two utilities in the state.

By the numbers: The company's filing with the NCUC requests an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, $275 million in 2028), which represents a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase over current revenues. The company's requests are based on a 10.95% return on equity and 53% equity capital structure and are subject to NCUC approval.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical Duke Energy Carolinas residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $17.22 a month – from $144.98 to $162.20 – starting Jan. 1, 2027, followed by a $6.34 increase on Jan. 1, 2028. Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 8.7% and 3.9% while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 6.3% and 3.4%.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical Duke Energy Progress residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $23.11 a month – from $163.84 to $186.95 – starting Jan. 1, 2027, followed by a $6.59 increase on Jan. 1, 2028. Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 9.2% and 4.6% while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 7.4% and 4.3%.

Our view:

""Our goal is to deliver reliable power at the lowest possible cost for customers,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""It's important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers.""

In addition to reducing operation and maintenance expenses since the last base rate case, other examples of cost-saving measures include:

The storm bonds Duke Energy issued following Hurricane Helene and other major storms are saving North Carolina customers $422 million.

Duke Energy's highly efficient nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits through 2032. Current rates return $150 million in nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Carolinas customers in 2025-2026; the new rate request proposes extending nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Progress customers and adding solar and hydro tax credits for both utilities.

Falling fuel price savings were passed along to customers last winter, reducing Duke Energy Carolinas rates by 6.2% and Duke Energy Progress rates by 4.5%.

The proposed combination of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress would save customers more than $1 billion in future costs.

Driving improved reliability: As part of its ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has tripled the number of North Carolina customers served by self-healing technology since 2022, significantly reducing outages. Today, 75% of customers are served by this technology, and it's making a difference: In the first 10 months of 2025, self-healing technology helped avoid more than 1.1 million customer outages in North Carolina and saved nearly 2.6 million hours of total outage time.

Other investments over the last five years have been more traditional: 43,500 miles of vegetation trimmed, 116,430 distribution poles replaced and 13,403 wood transmission poles upgraded to steel or concrete. Notably, zero non-wood poles across the Carolinas required replacement after Hurricane Helene, significantly accelerating power restoration following the most destructive storm in state history.

Powering economic growth: Duke Energy serves 3.6 million retail customers across the state and added about 150,000 customers in North Carolina over the last two years – primarily residences and small businesses. Driven by the state's economic success, electricity demand is rising at an unprecedented pace; in 2025 alone, companies have announced new projects bringing more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments to North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

The company is making cost-effective investments to reliably power this growth by:

Maximizing the value of existing generation , making it more efficient and able to generate more electricity to meet near-term growth needs at the lowest possible cost. For example, Duke Energy is adding nearly 300 megawatts (MW) of clean capacity through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations by 2031 – part of a nuclear fleet that achieved the nation's lowest total operating cost per megawatt-hour in four of the past six years.

Adding new generation , such as the clean, highly efficient natural gas facilities the NCUC approved last year in Person and Catawba counties. The 2027-2028 Multiyear Rate Plan component of the rate request calls for investing $1.7 billion in battery storage projects across the region, complemented by nearly $400 million in solar and solar paired with storage projects – 276 MW of solar and 31 MW of paired storage.

Helping customers manage costs: ""Customers count on us to manage our costs on their behalf, but they also want options to manage their own bills now,"" Bowman said. ""That's why we're helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.""

To help customers with rising costs, Duke Energy deploys a coordinated strategy that integrates energy efficiency programs, bill management tools, financial assistance and agency partnerships – details can be found at duke-energy.com/help for income-qualified programs and duke-energy.com/BillHelp for conventional programs. Options include:

Weatherization : Helps income-qualified customers save energy and reduce expenses by installing energy conservation measures in their homes.

Neighborhood Energy Saver : Offers free home energy assessments designed to help customers in income-qualifying neighborhoods learn how their homes use energy and how to lower electric bills. Qualified customers can receive up to 17 free products, even an HVAC unit, installed at no cost.

High Energy Use Pilot : Provides income-qualified customers free assistance for energy improvements – including heating and cooling system replacements, duct sealing, lighting and heat pump water heaters.

Home Energy House Call : Offers all customers a free home energy assessment and personalized recommendations on how to improve energy efficiency.

Smart $aver : Offers home improvement rebates for energy efficiency upgrades such as heating and cooling systems, water heaters, insulation and sealing ductwork, and pool pumps.

Power Manager : Rewards customers with bill credits for shifting energy use away from peak periods for qualified home appliances (e.g., smart thermostat, HVAC/water heater).

PowerPair : Provides financial incentives for customers who install solar and/or battery systems to help manage system load.

For North Carolina residential customers, last year, these programs delivered the following average annual bill savings:

Home Energy House Call: $46.68 per home

Smart $aver: $125.22 per home

Weatherization: $150.34 per home

Across the Carolinas, the company's aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. And improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves about 2 million households and businesses in Central and Western North Carolina, including Charlotte, Durham and the Triad, while Duke Energy Progress serves about 1.6 million customers in Central and Eastern North Carolina and in the Asheville region.

The two utilities last initiated base rate reviews in North Carolina in January 2023 and September 2022, respectively. If Duke Energy's request to combine the entities is approved by state and federal regulators next year, this would be the final base rate review conducted as separate utilities.

What's next: The NCUC is expected to issue an order calling for public hearings across the state in the spring followed by an evidentiary hearing next summer, then issue a final order on new rates in late 2026. Details on Duke Energy's proposal, the rate review process and the variety of assistance programs and billing options offered by the company can be found at duke-energy.com/NorthCarolinaRates.

The revised WOTUS definition aims to bring both the EPA and Corps regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA and provide clarity on the CWA’s regulatory scope.

Key elements of the proposed rule include:

Defining terms such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.”

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year.

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Adding a new exclusion for groundwater.

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

The EPA also announced it will hold two hybrid public meetings on the proposed rule. Information about these meetings is forthcoming.

Advocacy previously filed comments with the EPA in April when the agency was seeking input on this proposal. Advocacy specifically noted that small businesses “want WOTUS regulations that do not require them to hire attorneys or consultants to understand.”",https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/agency_US_Army_Corps_of_Engineers-1024x679.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:43.004779

This funding allows the CPIE team to support eligible facilities in North Carolina with technical assistance and application support.","The NC Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC) houses a team of experienced engineers that help identify practical solutions to reduce energy spending, while supporting sustainability or resilience. The Clean Power and Industrial Efficiency (CPIE) team has assisted large energy users, manufacturers, rural small businesses, agricultural producers, communities, and others with services tailored to their goals. The team primarily serves entities within North Carolina, however certain programs allow them to collaborate in areas throughout the Southeast United States.

Currently, the team is part of several programs that provide support to organizational professionals seeking assistance in preparing for their future energy use.

The CPIE team is committed to providing fact-based, technically accurate work to support various energy projects. The table below gives an overview of the services the team can offer through their many programs.

NCCETC is a member of the North Carolina Department of Commerce led project, Smart Manufacturing Adoption to Realize Transformative Energy Reductions for North Carolina (SMARTER NC), funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Both NC State University’s Industry Expansion Solutions (IES), an extension and outreach department, and NCCETC are on the team. Through the SMARTER NC project, small-to-medium manufacturers can receive assistance to offset costs and integrate “smart” manufacturing technologies. These technologies include practices like additive manufacturing, 3D printing, and any process where products are built in a way that reduces waste.

The CPIE team’s role in SMARTER NC is to provide energy assessments for facilities that are exploring opportunities in smart technology implementation. The energy assessments typically focus on the energy savings that will result from the smart technology of interest. If the technology relates to electricity, gas, or wastewater and does not have substantial energy savings, the team can perform a targeted assessment. A targeted energy assessment can look at a particular system such as instrument air, chillers, or boilers. If there is no system of interest, the team can do a general site walk-through assessment where they will observe all of the facility’s equipment to identify potential energy savings opportunities.

NCCETC Associate Director Isaac Panzarella is the head of the CPIE team, and also is the lead for the Southeast Onsite Energy Technical Assistance Partnership (TAP). This program is funded by the DOE and includes two partner universities: the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez (UPRM) and Tennessee Tech University. The Southeast Onsite Energy TAP is part of a network of 10 regional Onsite Energy TAPs, which help industrial facilities and large energy users transition to onsite energy practices that lower costs, reduce emissions, and contribute to the economy.

Onsite energy technologies include battery storage, district energy, fuel cells, geothermal systems, CHP, industrial heat pumps, renewable fuels, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, thermal storage, wind power, and other distributed energy solutions. These technologies generate or store electric and thermal energy directly at the location where it is consumed, which gives it the term “onsite energy”. The Onsite Energy TAPs offer specialized, regionally specific services that include technical assistance, end user engagement, and stakeholder engagement.

The CPIE team can evaluate facilities for onsite energy opportunities and deliver advanced services to optimize economic impact while mitigating risks throughout the process. They also focus on education and outreach by actively engaging with policymakers, utilities, and other key stakeholders to identify pathways that make onsite energy integration more accessible.

Another project the CPIE team focuses on is the Pollution Prevention (P2) Program, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiative that supports businesses interested in adopting source reduction practices. Source reduction is any practice that reduces, eliminates, or prevents pollution at its source – before it gets recycled, treated, or disposed of. These practices help businesses save money and provide environmental benefits. East Carolina University is the primary grant recipient of the P2 Program with NCCETC as a sub awardee. Through this program, the CPIE team provides technical assistance to businesses in six national emphasis areas (NEAs). The EPA has identified six industrial sector NEAs that have many opportunities for pollution prevention, economic, and environmental impacts.

The six industrial NEAs are:

Food and Beverage Manufacturing and Processing

Chemical Manufacturing, Processing, and Formulation

Automotive Manufacturing and Maintenance

Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing and Maintenance

Metal Manufacturing and Fabrication

Pollution Prevention in Native American Communities and for Alaska Native Villages

NCCETC can assist these industries by conducting onsite energy assessments and providing training for site personnel.

The team has also been focused on a project that will help characterize resiliency when it comes to clean energy technologies. The Resilient Renewable Energy to Diminish Disaster Impacts on Communities (Resilient REDDI Communities) project is intended to develop a set of resiliency metrics and create a playbook that will guide communities interested in integrating energy resilience strategies. The CPIE team supports communities across North Carolina through this project, and has most recently been involved in efforts to implement microgrids throughout Asheville. The team has engaged with a network of emergency managers, utilities, community organizations, and other interested parties to learn which practices would be most beneficial when it comes to providing reliable energy in the event of a disaster.

Although many of the team’s projects focus on large-scale energy operations, the CPIE team also provides technical assistance through a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiative that reduces the cost burden for small business and agricultural producers who are looking to implement energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides funding for rural small business and agricultural producers that submit applications for the implementation of specific renewable energy technologies. The USDA has provided funding to NCCETC through the Renewable Energy Development Assistance (REDA) program and the USDA REAP Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) program. This funding allows the CPIE team to support eligible facilities in North Carolina with technical assistance and application support. The team can identify appropriate renewable technologies and conduct energy assessments to determine generation potential, project cost, projected savings, and technology viability.",https://nccleantech.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-NCCETC-logo-No-Text-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-20 18:01:23.522185

Critics are disturbed by the route of the two proposed pipelines, now under review amid a surge of applications to build massive data centers in the region. Among their concerns: the lines, and compressor stations related to gas distribution, will be laid within hundreds of feet of each other in some locations in a North Carolina county and potentially disrupt rural lifestyles and landscapes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Virginia environmental regulators are reviewing long-running requests from Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC and the Williams Companies Inc. for billion-dollar extensions that would link to pivotal and existing crosscountry networks.

Mountain Valley Pipeline is seeking to build 31 miles of pipeline from Virginia into North Carolina, extending a 303-mile network that now cuts from the Marcellus and Utica shale along the Pennsylvania border through West Virginia to southern Virginia. MVP’s proposal, called the Southgate Extension, has been reviewed and revised since 2020. Mountain Valley is also requesting to add compressor stations along its main line: three in West Virginia and one in Montgomery County, Virginia, about 70 miles near where Southgate would begin.

The Williams Companies is requesting approval to build 55 new miles of pipeline to bolster its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, better known as Transco, that transports fracked gas from the Texas Gulf Coast across about a dozen states. The Williams Companies calls its proposal the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, or the SSEP, a pipeline that will expand capacity for Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and other states.

A FERC decision is expected for Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is operated by EQT Corp., by the end of the year. FERC is expected to review the proposal by The Williams Companies, based in Oklahoma, by February.

The Williams Companies also recently submitted a separate proposal for a pipeline expansion in Virginia, a plan that emerged in May during a quarterly earnings call. The Williams Companies said it was aiming to run pipe from Southern Virginia to “serve the power-hungry Virginia market” with a northern extension, dubbed the Power Express, and later told the Cardinal News website that the project was “in the early development stage.”

The rush for more reliance on gas is likely to gain pace.

The Virginia Department of Energy announced just weeks ago a partnership with the Williams Companies as well as Red Post Energy LLC, whose parent company is based in Australia, and Enbridge Inc., headquartered in Canada. The initiative will study new natural gas infrastructure proposals for “locations between Roanoke and Bristol,” according to a department release on Oct. 9.

The study “will evaluate site suitability, environmental considerations, interconnection requirements, and economic benefits including job creation, tax revenue, and regional development opportunities,” the department said. The release offered no deadline for the study’s completion.

All these proposals would thread miles more natural gas pipeline in a state that is seen as a hot property for companies seeking data centers as part of their growth strategy.

Those proposals are being considered as Virginia oversees other new operations coming on line. TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, is set this month to launch a pipeline, nearly 49 miles in length, near the Tidewater region. The Virginia Natural Gas local distribution company is also seeking by October 2027 to expand a compressor station in the city of Chesapeake, in southeastern Virginia, to boost smaller intrastate pipelines.

But some communities are raising concerns about the speed and breadth of many of these proposals—and they are complaining that towns and residents are having a difficult time sorting through the construction requests and possible risks.

Community advocates, in both states, said they want to know how regulators and towns are supposed to assess cumulative impacts and allow for proper public involvement in the process.

“How confusing and complicated,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator with Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit advocacy group based in North Carolina, said about the pipeline proposals and FERC’s analysis of the projects.

Data center proposals, tied to artificial intelligence work sought by technology and financial companies, are changing the landscape of some swaths of rural America. Virginia alone could see electricity demands triple by 2040 because of data center growth. The state, home to several federal agencies, has been keen to accommodate business interests tied to AI.

The Virginia General Assembly’s policy research unit has estimated that a new 1.5 gigawatt gas plant, enough to power about 375,000 homes, would need to be built every 18 months for 15 consecutive years as part of the energy mix needed if all the data center proposals become reality.

The expansion of natural gas is among the priorities of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump is a proponent of fossil fuels and early in his second term he issued an executive order “Unleashing American Energy.” Trump declared a widely disputed national energy emergency, which some companies such as Mountain Valley Pipeline have used to support pipeline expansion proposals.

Mountain Valley spokesperson Shawn Day said the company’s main line, a 303-mile project running from Northwest West Virginia into Pittsylvania County completed in 2024, ensured reliability. Day pointed to an April 2025 report by FERC and the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation, another regulatory group, that “credited MVP with helping to avoid” gas shortages “during extreme weather and periods of record demand early this year.”

“Opponents of the MVP Mainline claimed for years that the (main line) project wasn’t needed, and yet barely six months after it entered operation, the project was operating at its full capacity, providing a critical supply of natural gas for residential and business use and electricity generation,” Day said in an email. The Southgate extension will prove to be as useful if not critical for the region, MVP contends in its proposal.

The Williams Companies also focused on rising needs in its application for expansion. In an email to Inside Climate News, it described the SSEP as a “$1.2 billion investment that will strengthen energy reliability and deliver meaningful economic benefits across the region.”

SSEP “will meet or exceed all safety and environmental standards, while supporting climate and energy goals,” the Williams Companies statement said. “Assertions to the contrary misrepresent both the facts and our record of responsible development.”

That is not how some community groups—critical of coal mining in the region and fearful of the rapid demand of pipelines across the countryside—view the energy companies’ ambitions and regard for local residents. They fear that the development will harm their way of life.

“It all comes down to there has not been any transparency, any real data showing a need for all of this coming through here,” said Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Dan River Basin Association, who also questioned whether all the data centers will be built. There is a risk that energy companies are predicting and producing for a market that may not exist—and communities may suffer, she said.

“People want to turn their lights on. … We get that. But we already have a pipeline going through there,” Haworth said. “We as an organization don’t feel that the harm that it is going to cause to our waterways and our recreational outdoor recreational economy—over a million people get their drinking water from these rivers—makes sense.”

Kasey Kinsella, associate director of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous advocacy group that opposes the pipelines, said the companies’ plans, if completed, would destroy any chance of natural harmony.

“All of this is just so absurd,” Kinsella said.

Southgate in Virginia

Big energy companies and their related businesses have been eager to provide services in some of the fastest-growing states. Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Williams Companies have both focused on a North Carolina location—Rockingham County, population 91,000—as the choice for their expansion ambitions.

Mountain Valley Pipeline, operating in Virginia since 2014, first proposed the Southgate Extension in 2018 as a pipeline to extend from its main line, starting in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and running 31 miles deep into north central North Carolina. That extension was approved in 2020 by FERC—but on the condition that the main line received its necessary approvals.

The main line construction faced several legal disputes for nearly a decade. In 2023, MVP benefited from congressional pressure orchestrated by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin pushed its permit through during the federal budget process then. By June 2024, the main line was operating.

The Southgate proposal, too, has faced some trouble from regulators. The Virginia Air Pollution Control Board in 2021 reviewed and rejected MVP’s permit request for Southgate based on health concerns. The board found the pipeline path would cause potentially disproportionate harm to Black residential areas.

In late 2023, months after the main line approval, MVP revised its Southgate plan with some major changes.

MVP’s proposed new Southgate would traverse 31 miles rather than 75 miles–and ends at a different place. MVP’s previous Southgate proposal had terminated in Alamance County in North Carolina; the new plan will end in nearby Rockingham County.

FERC in 2024 released an environmental assessment, that the amended project “would result in fewer environmental effects than the” original MVP plan. It “would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” although there would be some impacts to prime farmland, forested areas and wetlands, FERC said.

FERC notably found that the Southgate proposal would not be likely to “adversely affect” federally endangered animals in the area, including the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat. The project, FERC also said, would “not result in significant effects,” on state-listed species, including the bigeye jumprock, which the Virginia Department of Wildlife has designated as having “high conservation need.”

FERC also found that MVP’s proposed method of horizontal directional drilling, or boring that goes under streams instead of digging ditches across them, would avoid environmental harm. Horizontal drilling “greatly reduces potential effects on surface waterbodies, particularly compared to open-cut crossings. In general, typical pipeline effects on waterbodies are avoided with trenchless methods,” FERC said in its 2024 assessment.

Williams Companies’s Plan

The Williams Companies’s SSEP is also proposed to run from Pittsylvania County in Virginia and end in Rockingham County. The Williams Companies aims to build two loops of pipeline–a 31-mile section crossing the Virginia and North Carolina border is called the “Eden Loop” and a 24.2-mile stretch in North Carolina is dubbed the “Salem Loop.” Both would link to its pipeline running from Texas.

In an environmental assessment report in 2024, FERC reviewed Williams Companies’s plan and found no “significant impact” to the “quality of human environment. The effect on “vegetation would be minor and mostly temporary to short term,” and “effects on wildlife from construction and operation of the Project would not be significant,” according to the FERC report.

FERC also assessed the cumulative impacts of both MVP’s Southgate and The Williams Companies’s SSEP proposal based on a myriad of aspects, including wetlands. MVP’s proposal would affect 18.2 acres of wetlands during construction, it said, and the Williams Companies’ Eden Loop would affect 27.5 acres of wetlands.

Because of the overlapping construction area and timetable of the projects, “cumulative effects on surface water quality may occur,” FERC said. It noted that “The magnitude of effects would depend on the specific timeframe of crossing the same waterbodies.”

Sims of Appalachian Voices said FERC did not go far enough in looking at the double whammy of two pipeline projects—with trucks, traffic and construction—converging on Rockingham County. “I’m not sure how anyone could look at that much information and come to that conclusion,” Sims said of FERC’s report.

Sims said having the two projects, which could be as close as within 200 feet of each other in some areas of the criss-crossing routes, could be problematic if there were structural failures in either network. She questioned how regulators would track which company was responsible for erosion and sediment problems that could choke flora and fauna.

“If you have projects that are so closely routed with construction at the same time, the blame–if there are sedimentation problems–it’s even more complicated,” Sims said.

Broader Community Concerns

Haworth of The Dan River Basin Association, based in North Carolina, said she and others are concerned that MVP’s and the Williams Companies’s projects will upend years of work to protect the environment and the river that flows through eight counties in Virginia and North Carolina.

The river basin, a 3,300 square mile watershed, is fed by the Smith, Mayo, Banister, Hayco and Sandy rivers. The waterways have weathered troubling industrial demands before, she said, and residents across state borders have some vivid memories of a time when textiles dominated the economic and environmental landscape.

The dye from a factory in Martinsville, Virginia, would flow into the Smith River and change the color of the stream ”running down all the way down into North Carolina,” Haworth said. In 2014, one of Duke Energy Corp.’s steam stations in Eden, North Carolina, sprung a leak, leading the U.S. Department of Interior to find that approximately 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water” were released and resulted in a threat to endangered species and migratory birds.

“We’ve worked really hard for two decades, working with municipalities and state government, to make sure that these natural resources remain protected, preserved for future generations, and pipelines do not quite fit into that,” Haworth said.

Haworth wondered how FERC could find “no significant impact” on the quality of life for people who will live near miles of heavy construction. “When they say minimal impact, no amount of impact is worth hurting people. A million people’s drinking water,” she said.

Kinsella of the advocacy group 7 Directions of Service said she is concerned about every part of the expansion. No one should overlook, she said, the impact of compressors along the pipeline trail. They too will add noise and stress, she said, particularly so to neighborhoods that have historically been burdened with industrial pressures.

The energy companies may try to monetarily compensate the residents with onetime financial checks but that won’t really address how their lives will be changed, she said.

“What will the cost be when there are health impacts from an expanded compressor station?” Kinsella said. “My heart goes out to these working class folks along the main line route who, their land, their water, their livelihood, psychologically, has been just so beat up over the past 10 years in this fight.”

FERC is expected to make a decision on Southgate by the end of the year. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) also is undergoing a water protection permit process that will assess streams and wetland impacts. A public hearing for the permit is scheduled Thursday night and a decision is expected Dec. 8.

Melanie Davenport, director of DEQ’s cross-media programs, said the agency has requested erosion and sediment stormwater protection plans, which would prevent loose dirt from washing into waterways.

FERC is expected to decide SSEP by February. Virginia DEQ’s also is reviewing and will have to approve two water quality permits for the project.

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which is also reviewing the proposals, recently approved a permit for Mountain Valley Pipeline for the Southgate Extension but the project cannot move forward without FERC approval.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1514932691-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:48.285577

“Robust investment in renewables and storage will be required to meet US demand growth in this timeframe.","With the US preparing for approximately 90 gigawatts (GW) of peak demand growth through 2030, gas and coal generation will only be able to meet about 37 GW of this growth, according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Power Hungry: Why Gas and Coal Alone Won’t Keep Up with US Power Demand Growth” from Wood Mackenzie, meeting this demand growth through 2030 is the largest challenge faced by the US power sector.

“If more plant retirements are delayed, the value could rise to 67 GW, but significant uncertainty surrounds how many more retirements will be deferred,” Patrick Huang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “90 GW of demand growth is well below the 160 GW of US utilities’ large load commitments tracked by Wood Mackenzie, as supply dictates how much demand growth can materialize.”

Huang added that if coal and gas plants ramp up utilization, the existing thermal fleet could meet up to 47 GW of peak demand growth. This is less than 30% of the large load commitments made by US utilities and will be offset by 98 GW of planned coal and gas retirements (59 GW of peak load contribution lost) through 2030. Further retirement deferrals could keep 50 GW (30 GW of peak load contribution) online past 2030, but even in this scenario coal and gas generation falls short of meeting total demand growth. Since keeping old coal and gas units online for longer is expensive and can run against state priorities, delaying retirements for a large portion of the existing fleet will be challenging.

The report notes that manufacturing bottlenecks are a key constraint on new thermal capacity. Gas turbine orders currently face extended lead times, with new gas plant additions limited to 58 GW (49 GW of peak load contribution) between 2025 and the end of 2030. Furthermore, the rising cost of gas turbines will make these additions very expensive in comparison to current wholesale electricity prices. Our analysis shows that renewables need to play a key role in making demand growth in the US more affordable.

“While gas and coal generation will play a large role in enabling strong load growth, it’s clear that the existing thermal fleet cannot meet this new demand alone,” said Huang. “Robust investment in renewables and storage will be required to meet US demand growth in this timeframe. Also, given that solar only shines during the day and economic long-duration energy storage is not widely available, wind generation needs to be a key part of meeting demand growth.”","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/gas/macro-gas/macro_gas_gettyimages-724285883.jpg?width=800&height=480&rmode=crop&rxy=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-11-20 17:01:15.411449

The NC State Agrivoltaics Training Site is the first of its kind in the Southeast, where students and solar professionals can learn practices in agrivoltaics and the installation of solar technology that enables installation on steep terrain through Nevados’ proprietary tracker technology. Agrivoltaics is the co-location of solar panels and agricultural activities — including food and livestock production — on the same land.

“This new solar training site is a testament to the power of partnership,” said Chris Frey, associate dean for research & infrastructure at the College of Engineering. “It is an amazing interdisciplinary collaboration between NC State’s Clean Energy Technology Center, the Department of Animal Science and Nevados, a manufacturer of solar tracking systems. And it positions NC State as a continuing leader in energy and agricultural education for students and professionals throughout their careers.”

Yesterday’s launch included a preview of the university’s new agrivoltaics training, Agrivoltaics in Action: Enhancing Operations and Maintenance in Livestock-Integrated Solar Sites. This course, which will launch in Spring 2026, equips solar professionals with essential skills for navigating grazed solar sites, including working with electric fencing, guardian animals and sheep-based vegetation management, while offering strategies to streamline operations and maintenance and foster collaboration between solar operators and grazing professionals.

“Grazing sheep on solar farms offers a multitude of benefits for the solar and sheep industry,” said Dr. Andrew Weaver, Assistant Professor of Animal Science. “These benefits include reduced mowing needs and more cost effective vegetation management, farmland preservation, improved public perception, and career opportunities for local sheep producers. The NC State Agrivoltaics Training Site will provide an invaluable opportunity to train our students and farmers in the best management practices for solar grazing. This training site isn’t just about solar energy; it’s about pioneering the future of sheep production – a future that is more resilient, productive, and profitable for North Carolina and the world.”

The training site, including three rows of Nevados’ TRACE All Terrain Tracker system and three types of solar modules, will be used for agrivoltaics education, especially solar grazing, and solar technician training through the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, Nevados and the Department of Animal Science

When electricity users match their usage with new, near, and now clean electricity, the energy grid becomes more efficient, and savings can be passed along to consumers.","WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today introduced the Clean Cloud Act, legislation to establish emission standards for electricity used by high-demand energy users such as cryptominers and data centers. The measure has seven original cosponsors. The companion bill was introduced by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), and Senator John Fetterman (D-PA).

Congressman Cohen made the following statement:

“The rapid growth of cryptominers and data centers is straining our energy grid and outpacing the growth of carbon-free electricity. Utilities are raising consumer electricity rates and relying increasingly on gas and coal generation to meet this load growth. In some instances, retired coal plants have even been brought back online to power cryptomining facilities. Even in markets with solar or wind, data centers often run 24/7 and require either long-duration storage or clean firm generation to be truly carbon neutral.

“Memphis already hosts significant data-center and data-processing operations, and more companies are looking to the Mid-South because of our strategic location. But Memphis is one of the most energy-burdened cities in America where families spend a larger share of their income on utilities than almost anywhere in the country. We cannot allow high-demand industries to increase pressure on the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) system or lead to higher bills for Memphis households.

“The Clean Cloud Act ensures that as data-center development inevitably grows, it’s powered responsibly, supported by new zero-carbon generation, and doesn’t leave communities like ours footing the bill.”

The bill also:

• Requires an annual, published survey of cryptominers and data centers

• Establishes an emissions intensity baseline

• Incentivizes new clean power development

• Supports energy affordability programs for residential consumers

• Invests in zero-carbon electricity and battery storage

The Clean Cloud Act is endorsed by the following organizations: EnergyTag, Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA), Public Citizen, Southern Environmental Law Center, and Center for Biological Diversity

Endorsement statements:

“The US is experiencing significant demand growth driven, in part, by data center buildout and rapidly increasing electricity consumption. The Clean Cloud Act asks the largest energy users to take responsibility for their impacts by matching their electricity consumption with new clean electricity matched to the hour when and the location where they operate. When electricity users match their usage with new, near, and now clean electricity, the energy grid becomes more efficient, and savings can be passed along to consumers. The solutions outlined in this bill will help ensure that industrial growth does not exacerbate the affordability crisis we see today and drives around the clock clean energy forward,” said Alex Piper, Head of US Policy and Markets at EnergyTag. “EnergyTag applauds Congressman Cohen for his leadership here. Clean, affordable growth is necessary and possible, and this bill sets the foundation.”

“This is a meaningful step toward finally reining in pollution from the high-emitting AI and cryptomining industries. The commonsense measures in the Clean Cloud Act will cut carbon emissions and prevent these sectors from deepening the climate crisis and putting communities at risk,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Rep. Cohen’s bill is a smart, much-needed move to bring oversight to these industries, which have operated without safeguards.”

“We fully support the goals behind the Clean Cloud Act, especially the opportunity to build additional power generation, increase electric grid stability and grow energy industry jobs,” said Utility Workers Union of America President James Slevin. “We anticipate electricity demand on the grid continuing to grow exponentially over the coming years and we appreciate Congressman Cohen’s continued advocacy on this important issue.”

The findings are from a new report by Environmental Defense Fund and Atlas Public Policy.

“These cancelled clean energy manufacturing projects will cause financial hardships for communities across the country, many of which saw investment for the first time in a generation,” said Ellen Robo, Senior Manager for Clean Air Policy and Analytics at Environmental Defense Fund. “Turning away from clean, affordable, made-in-America technologies will mean our country has fewer manufacturing jobs, dirtier and more expensive energy systems, and reduced competitiveness. Our economy and our planet cannot afford for us to make this mistake.”

U.S. clean energy manufacturing saw historic growth from 2021 through 2024 but crashed this year in the face of hostile policies from the Trump administration. According to the report, in spite of billions in announced new investments and some months of positive growth, clean energy manufacturing investments overall are still significantly lower this year compared to this point in 2024.

From 2021 to 2024, companies announced more than $220 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing projects across the U.S. However, policy shifts and funding cuts under the Trump administration have led to cancellations of almost $25 billion of those investments so far in 2025, with a loss of more than 34,000 anticipated jobs. In October, $3.9 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects were canceled and 6,700 anticipated jobs were lost. Those numbers are slightly offset by some new investments, but overall investment are still down by billions.

Six of the last 10 months have seen negative overall investment, meaning new investments were overwhelmed by cancellations.

By clarifying which waters are jurisdictional, this rule offers a more predictable permitting process, reducing administrative burdens and supporting housing production and affordability.","In a move championed by NAHB, the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have announced a proposed updated definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) that would provide builders much-needed clarity by defining which waters are subject to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways. The proposed rule was published on Nov. 20 in the Federal Register for a 45-day comment period.

The proposed rule:

Limits federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act to traditional navigable waters and the relatively permanent waters that flow from them, such as year-round or seasonally flowing lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands that directly abut those waters,

Defines key terms including “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection,”

Removes interstate waters as a separate jurisdictional category, and

Reaffirms exclusions for most ditches, prior-converted cropland and waste treatment systems.

This rule corrects the overreach of the 2023 conforming rule, which had broadly interpreted “relatively permanent” and allowed wetlands connected by swales, pipes or man-made drainage to be considered jurisdictional.

A March 2025 EPA and Corps guidance clarified that only wetlands physically abutting a jurisdictional water, without intervening upland, berm or dike, meet the continuous surface connection test. This change aligns federal jurisdiction more closely with the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA and Rapanos v. United States decisions.

For home builders, the proposed rule provides greater regulatory certainty. Unclear jurisdictional boundaries have long caused project delays, added costs, and unpredictable permitting. Further, in states that regulate beyond the federal definition of WOTUS, vague federal requirements have caused confusion regarding the permitting authority for dredge and fill projects.

Massachusetts isn’t going to gut its landmark climate law—yet.

The state House of Representatives appeared this week to be speeding toward passage of H4744, a bill that would revise some of the programs and policies behind the state’s requirement to halve its emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels.

But on Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz, a Democrat, said members needed more time to review the bill’s many moving parts. This likely kicks any action into 2026 because lawmakers were to conclude their regular business for the year on Wednesday.

Climate and clean energy advocates expressed relief. They had organized in the few days since the legislation surfaced on Nov. 13 and were lobbying to either kill the bill or add amendments to weaken it.

If the bill had passed in anything resembling its current form, Massachusetts—a national leader on climate policy—would have strengthened the idea that 2025 is a year of fading climate ambitions in the states. Arizona, Connecticut, New York and North Carolina are among the states that have reduced their climate goals or taken other actions that make achieving emissions reductions harder. (I’ll get to specifics in the other states in a moment.)

“We will survive the Trump administration, but we can’t survive having states like Massachusetts bail,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at Green Energy Consumers Alliance, an advocacy group that covers Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Chretien viewed many parts of the bill as harmful, including a provision that would reduce funding for the Mass Save energy efficiency program by $500 million. He is hopeful that Gov. Maura Healey and the leaders of the House and Senate, all Democrats, can work together in the coming months to find ways to make energy more affordable while maintaining the state’s climate and clean energy policy trajectory.

But the political and economic factors that led to the bill remain. The main sponsor, Rep. Mark Cusack, a Democrat and chair of the committee that oversees energy policy, said the bill was a response to concerns about energy affordability.

Democrats in Massachusetts and across the country want to run in next year’s mid-term elections as the party of affordability and they want to tie Republicans to soaring electricity rates and rising costs of other essentials.

It’s easy for Republicans to blame high electricity costs on the transition away from fossil fuels. This is even though some of the cost concerns are tied to the Trump administration’s budget cuts and the cancellation of grants that helped fund state-level programs.

The complexity of the subject doesn’t lend itself to campaign messages. Power bills are surging due to rising electricity demand from data centers and other large users, increasing natural gas prices and other factors, including spending to support climate and clean energy policies. The significance of each factor varies by state and utility.

Here’s some of what’s happened in other states:

Arizona: The Arizona Corporation Commission is in the process of repealing the state’s requirement, adopted in 2006, that utilities get 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. On Aug. 14, the commission voted unanimously to direct its staff to continue with the repeal. Commission Chair Kevin Thompson, a Republican, said in a statement that renewable energy technology “should be able to prevail on its own without the need for mandates that have added millions of dollars in extra costs for ratepayers each year.” One wrinkle in this discussion is that Arizona utilities already have met the standard. The debate is mostly about whether it makes sense to have a standard at all, with environmental advocates arguing that a repeal sends the wrong message about the state’s long-term direction.

Connecticut: On July 1, Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, signed Senate Bill 4, which reduces the state’s targets for its renewable portfolio standard and also allows for wood-burning and other biomass to count toward meeting the standard. The new renewable standard for 2030 requires utilities to get 29 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, down from 40 percent before this change. Lamont said in a statement that “electric bills are too damn high” and described the bill as a first step in addressing a complex issue.

New York: Unlike other states that are backsliding on climate, New York’s shift has been through a series of small actions rather than a single bill or regulatory order. These actions have left climate and clean energy advocates feeling that Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is willing to undermine prior laws and rules that have made the state a leader in climate policy. One example is the Northeast Supply Enhancement gas pipeline, which had been stalled but now appears to be proceeding toward construction, as my colleague Lauren Dalban reported.

North Carolina: In July, the Republican-controlled legislature overrode the veto of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, of a bill that cancels Duke Energy’s carbon reduction target of 70 percent by 2030 compared to 2005. The bill, which sponsors called “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” has now become law, undoing a key part of a state climate law adopted in 2021, as my colleague Lisa Sorg reported.

Reviewing these examples from states underscores how important Massachusetts is for shaping the national narrative. States tend to follow one another, and certain states, including Massachusetts, play an outsize role because of their history of leadership.

If Massachusetts joins the other states in backsliding, it’s easy to imagine someone in a committee room in, say, Michigan, pointing to Massachusetts and saying it’s long past time for Michigan to follow suit.

Note that I didn’t list Pennsylvania among the states retreating. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, reached a budget deal with Republicans in the legislature that says the state will not join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But, as ICN’s Pennsylvania reporter, Kiley Bense, reminded me this week, the budget deal isn’t exactly backsliding: The state has never participated in the regional coalition and is not a leader on climate policy.

I don’t want to focus exclusively on states moving backward.

Illinois is an example of a state moving forward with the passage this month of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which expands energy conservation and seeks to increase development of battery energy storage, among many other provisions.

But Illinois is the exception, according to Autumn Proudlove, managing director for policy and markets for the NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University.

“We’ve definitely seen a new trend of states considering legislation that would delay clean energy targets and commitments or remove interim targets,” she said.

Interim targets are important. If a state says it’s going to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, that goal is much more meaningful if there are requirements to meet benchmarks along the way. Failure to meet interim targets can be a wake-up call that policies aren’t working and that lawmakers need to do more.

Or, in this political moment, failure or impending failure to meet interim targets can be an excuse to get rid of them or weaken them. So, Massachusetts, what’s it going to be?",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/american-public-power-association-XGAZzyLzn18-unsplash-scaled-2-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 16:02:21.300991

Today’s agreement between the EPA, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Environmental Health was approved in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The agreement and the 2025 lawsuit it resolves are part of an ongoing effort to compel the EPA to protect people and the environment from air pollution, including ozone pollution, in compliance with the Clean Air Act.","OAKLAND, Calif.— A federal judge approved a legal agreement today requiring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to act on smog pollution in the Phoenix-Mesa metro area by Feb. 3, 2026.

But the agency has proposed excusing Phoenix from taking any action to clean up the dangerous pollution under a rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act that allows exemptions based on emissions from abroad.

The EPA must now give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal.

“It’s outrageous that the Trump EPA wants to use international emissions as an excuse to do nothing instead of reducing the dangerous smog Phoenix residents are forced to breathe every day,” said Benjamin Rankin, an associate attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “People in the Phoenix metro area can push back and demand that the Trump administration act aggressively and urgently to reduce unhealthy pollution rather than pander to the polluters causing it.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set “national ambient air quality standards” for pollutants such as ozone, commonly known as smog. The EPA set air standards for ozone in 2015, but a decade later it is failing to ensure that Phoenix is reducing ozone pollution to healthy levels.

People exposed to excess ozone are at risk of reduced lung function and increased respiratory problems like asthma, suffering more emergency room visits and premature deaths. Around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are being chronically exposed to ozone pollution caused by industrial and vehicle emissions and extreme heat.

Ozone also causes widespread environmental harms by stunting tree growth, damaging leaves and increasing plants’ susceptibility to disease, insect damage and harsh weather.

“It’s high time that the Trump administration took action to protect people from disease-causing ozone pollution, especially children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable,” said Shakoora Azimi-Gaylon, senior director of toxic exposures and pollution prevention at the Center for Environmental Health. “It’d be a shame if the EPA only stops sitting on its hands just to let Phoenix off the hook for its ozone problem. We must continue to fight for clean air for the millions of people living in Phoenix.”

An EPA study found that Clean Air Act programs to reduce fine particle and ozone pollution prevented more than 230,000 deaths, 200,000 heart attacks, and 2.4 million asthma attacks in 2020 alone. For each dollar spent, Americans have received more than $30 of health benefits in return.

While protecting the health of Americans, the Clean Air Act has also helped to keep the U.S. economy healthy by creating jobs, with an estimated 1.6 million Americans employed in the environmental technology industry helping to keep our air clean.

“This pollution harms people in the worst ways possible,” said Tom Fox, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Environmental Health.","OAKLAND, Calif.— The Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Environmental Health filed a lawsuit today challenging the Trump Environmental Protection Agency’s failure to protect millions of California and Colorado residents from dangerous smog pollution.

“Trump’s EPA is forcing millions of people to breathe extremely harmful levels of smog, day after day,” said Ryan Maher, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “As this administration gives handout after handout to the fossil fuel industry and other polluters, we’re counting on the courts to step in and protect public health.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards to protect people and the environment from pollutants like smog. When those standards are violated, the agency must ensure that states have valid plans in place to clean up the pollution.

The Denver metro area and the West Mojave Desert regions at issue in the lawsuit are home to more than 4 million people. Both regions suffer from air quality that does not meet federal standards for dangerous ozone pollution, commonly referred to as smog.

Ozone exposure has severe impacts on people, plants, and animals. Ozone pollution is particularly harmful to children and the elderly, causing asthma and reduced lung function. In the Denver metro area alone, more than 750,000 children and nearly 550,000 elderly people are put at risk by unsafe ozone levels, according to the American Lung Association.

Ozone also stunts the growth of trees and increases their susceptibility to disease, insect damage, and harsh weather. Unchecked levels of harmful air pollution threaten many much-loved spaces in the Western Mojave Desert, including Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and the Mojave Trails National Monument.

“This pollution harms people in the worst ways possible,” said Tom Fox, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Environmental Health. “It’s imperative that Trump’s EPA uphold its duty to protect the public’s health by acting immediately, as the law requires.”

A variety of sources contribute to smog, including the fossil fuel industry and vehicle emissions. In the Denver metro area, for example, nearly half of the emissions causing smog arise from the production of dirty fossil fuels.

In the Western Mojave, the EPA’s failure to regulate local air quality is part of the Trump administration’s broader push to prioritize corporate profit over its lawful conservation duties. Earlier this year the president unlawfully approved mining in the Mojave National Preserve and, during the government shutdown, the Department of the Interior targeted Joshua Tree National Park for cuts to conservation and education resources.

In fact, in many states like North Dakota, it’s part of our identity - and a vital part of keeping the lights on.
It happened not because anyone “targeted” coal - it’s because markets evolve, technologies advance, and consumers benefit when energy stays affordable.
I understand the frustration - coal communities deserve support and respect, and we all want American energy to stay strong.
Heidi Heitkamp is a Former North Dakota Senator (2013-2019).","In 2019, the United States became a net energy exporter for the first time in over 60 years – a position our country has maintained since. This milestone wasn’t accidental; it was the result of hard work, innovation, and an energy strategy that let all sources, including oil, gas, coal, and renewables, compete on a fair playing field.

During my time in the Senate, I supported efforts to prevent government mandates that tip the scales effectively, picking winners and losers. I believe markets, not mandates, do the best job of delivering affordable, reliable energy to American families. Free markets are the most capable tool for driving solutions that benefit consumers and tackle our country’s biggest challenges – not Washington bureaucrats. Whether it’s coal in North Dakota or solar in Arizona, every energy source deserves a fair chance to compete and succeed on its merit, and I opposed regulatory frameworks that sought to tip the scales against fossil fuels, instead favoring subsidized “green” alternatives.

My work in energy policy and willingness to cross party lines caught the attention of President Trump, who asked me to switch parties and even considered me for a Cabinet position. I appreciated President Trump’s focus on American energy independence, and we shared a belief that our nation should use every tool in the toolbox to power our economy and create good jobs.

That’s why I was surprised to see the administration lend its support to an antitrust lawsuit that seems at odds with that same market-driven approach we’ve both championed.

Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with eleven other states, filed an antitrust lawsuit against three large asset managers: BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. In May, the Trump Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case.

The lawsuit alleges that these firms conspired to influence coal companies by using their investments to promote environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, ultimately reducing production and raising costs. It’s fair to ask how large investors are shaping corporate priorities - but from what I’ve seen, the evidence doesn’t back up the idea of a coordinated effort to limit coal production.

The asset managers held relatively modest stakes in these coal companies and often voted in line with management, including efforts to expand production. In fact, coal output actually rose during the period in question - another reminder that markets, not backroom deals, tend to drive energy outcomes.

We should be careful that efforts to hold Wall Street accountable don’t cross into territory that chills investment or injects politics into the marketplace. Many of the actions cited, such as joining climate-related investor coalitions, are common among firms seeking to respond to shifting market trends and regulatory landscapes. That doesn’t necessarily imply bad faith or collusion.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent, bipartisan body, looked at these same issues and found no undue influence. FERC ultimately concluded there was no evidence these firms exerted undue control over corporate decision-making. That should give us pause before turning normal market activity into a federal case.

The broader concern is the potential chilling effect on energy investment. This case, if successful, could lead to divestment from coal companies amounting to nearly $18 billion. The last thing we need is uncertainty that scares off investors or limits capital for the very industries we want to strengthen.

Coal has always played a significant role in America’s energy mix. In fact, in many states like North Dakota, it’s part of our identity - and a vital part of keeping the lights on. But the unfortunate reality is that shift occurred in the marketplace. It happened not because anyone “targeted” coal - it’s because markets evolve, technologies advance, and consumers benefit when energy stays affordable. Litigation isn’t likely to reverse that trend and may only introduce more uncertainty into an already volatile sector.

I understand the frustration - coal communities deserve support and respect, and we all want American energy to stay strong. But the best way to do that is by keeping our approach grounded in competition, innovation, and common sense. That’s how we keep energy made in America - and make sure every community, from coal country to the coasts, shares that success.

Stay Grounded in Your Health – and Your Finances Rising health care costs can feel overwhelming, but knowledge and planning go a long way.","(Family Features) Homeowners still have time to take advantage of a federal tax credit of up to 30% of the cost of eligible energy-efficient home improvements. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home’s overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home’s curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today’s heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you’re a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands’ complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you’re installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you’ll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer’s pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

(Family Features) Heart health is about more than just the heart itself. It’s a two-way street between the heart and the rest of the body. However, many U.S. adults aren’t aware of the connection between organs.

According to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association, 42% of U.S. adults do not understand how the heart can be impacted by other organ systems.

Health issues in other organ systems, like the kidneys or metabolic system – which includes how the body manages weight and blood glucose – can lead to heart trouble.

The close relationship between heart health, kidney health and metabolic health is known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health, or CKM health, and it is the focus of an American Heart Association initiative to raise awareness of how the systems function together. When one system is affected, it can make the others worse – creating a condition called CKM syndrome.

Close to 9 in 10 U.S. adults have at least one component of CKM syndrome, according to a study in the “Journal of the American Medical Association.” Components include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol or other lipids, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone.

The survey also found that while only 12% of U.S. adults have heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome, 72% said they’re interested in learning more and 79% agreed that it is important that they understand more about CKM health.

“What we want people to know is it’s really common to have heart disease, diabetes or metabolic disease and reduced kidney function at the same time,” said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association’s chief medical officer for prevention. “It’s reassuring to hear that once the CKM connection was defined around three-quarters of respondents understood that it was important and wanted to learn more.”

Highlighting the two-way street of the heart-body connection, the “2 Truths and No Lie” video offers a simplified visual:

The heart pumps blood to the body.

The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) in the blood into energy.

The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood.

The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure.

Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood to the body.

While providing resources to help people understand how heart, kidney and metabolic health are connected, the American Heart Association’s CKM Health Initiative is also working with health care teams across the country to improve collaboration among health care professionals who care for patients living with multiple health conditions. Better awareness and improved screening can help people take action early to prevent a heart attack, heart failure or stroke.

The initiative is made possible by founding sponsors Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim, supporting sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and champion sponsor DaVita.

A health care insider shares tips for staying well and financially grounded, even in a tough economy

(Family Features) As the cost of living continues to rise, many Americans are being forced to make difficult financial decisions – weighing whether to pay rent, get groceries or fill prescriptions. Skipping medications might seem like a quick way to save money, but this can lead to serious health risks and even higher costs down the road.

In fact, research shows 27% of Americans skip prescriptions each month due to cost. More than half of Americans who filled a prescription this year said the cost felt like a financial burden, with 1 in 3 people cutting back on essentials like food or clothing to afford their medications.

These trade-offs highlight just how important it is to find practical, affordable ways to stay on treatment. Fortunately, there are proven strategies to help individuals stay current with their medications without breaking the bank. Cindy George, MPH, a senior personal finance editor at GoodRx and nationally recognized health journalist, shared expert advice to help consumers and their families improve their health care cost literacy, reduce expenses and stay healthy without overspending.

Understand the True Cost of Medications

Many people assume the pharmacy counter price is non-negotiable, but in reality, the cost of the same medication can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy or use of available savings tools.

“Many people don’t realize there is no single price for a prescription,” George said. “Costs can vary by upwards of $100 from one pharmacy to the next, even in the same ZIP code. Understanding how to compare prices and find the most affordable option is incredibly valuable. Just like travel sites show you different options for airlines or hotels and their associated expenses, prescription price comparison sites show how much your medication costs at each pharmacy and provide you with available savings.”

By entering the medication name, along with dosage and ZIP code, individuals can quickly compare prices in their area using GoodRx. Using the website or app, you can explore alternative forms of a medication and get suggestions to help you talk with your doctor or pharmacist about more affordable options.

When Insurance Falls Short, You Still Have Options

Today, only about half of all prescriptions are fully covered by insurance without restrictions. Many have conditions, such as step therapy, quantity limits or prior authorizations, that can lead to delays or higher costs at the pharmacy counter.

“Even insured individuals are struggling to keep up with health care costs,” George said. “More and more are finding themselves underinsured, and that’s making basic health care harder to afford – and harder to access – for millions of families.”

That’s why comparison shopping is increasingly important for people in the U.S. Even those with Medicare or Medicaid may benefit from cost comparisons. For that reason, George said it’s smart to look at all your options, including price comparisons at different pharmacies.

“Cost comparison tools can help people find lower prices on both generic and brand-name medications, regardless of their coverage status,” she said.

While these resources are not a full replacement for health insurance, they can be a helpful way to reduce medication costs and avoid unexpected surprises at the pharmacy.

Build Confidence Through Cost Literacy

Cost literacy is about more than just looking up prices. It involves understanding how insurance works, what’s included in a plan’s formulary, how to interpret billing documents and how to challenge costs that seem too high. According to George, “health care cost literacy” is one of the best investments you can make in your overall financial well-being.

“Improving your health care cost literacy starts with being aware of your options and asking the right questions,” she said. “Learn the basics, like what a premium, deductible or copay means, and review your insurance plan’s benefits and covered medications.”

George recommends starting with trusted tools that break down health care costs and terminology.

“Tools like the GoodRx Guide to Drug Costs, Coverage and Savings, cost estimators from hospitals and insurance plans and State Health Insurance Assistance Programs – known as SHIPs – for Medicare can help you better understand and manage costs,” she said. “If something is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask your provider, pharmacist or insurance representative to walk you through your bills or Explanation of Benefits.”

Simple Strategies Can Add Up

Small adjustments in how medications are filled can make a major difference over time. George recommends a few consistent strategies that can reduce out-of-pocket costs:

Always compare prices, including your insurance copay. “People assume their insurance copay is the best deal for accessing a medication at the lowest cost, but that’s not always true,” George said. “It’s important to compare prices upfront to ensure you’re taking the most affordable option.”

Uncover brand-name savings programs. Many pharmaceutical companies offer copay cards or patient assistance programs that can dramatically reduce your costs for brand-name or specialty medications.

Explore generic medications, if available. Generic medications typically cost less than their brand-name counterparts. Check with a health care professional before opting for a generic, because there might be specific reasons the brand-name version was prescribed.

Consider a 90-day supply. For chronic conditions, ask a health care professional whether you can switch from a 30-day supply of medication to a 90-day supply, since this is often cheaper per dose.

Try delivery. Ordering through a mail-order pharmacy can add convenience and, in many cases, offer lower prices, particularly for ongoing prescriptions.

Stay Grounded in Your Health – and Your Finances

Rising health care costs can feel overwhelming, but knowledge and planning go a long way. By building confidence through cost literacy, comparing prices and using tools to explore savings opportunities, consumers can remain in control of both their care and their budgets.

The Los Angeles Times reported national EV sales in July jumped 19% compared with a year earlier.
In addition, she noted that the used EV market will be getting a boost from cars coming off short-term leases of past couple years.
More than 50% of EVs are leased; historically, EVs coming off lease have substantially reduced prices.
In addition, 74% of current EV owners said they intended to buy an EV for their next vehicle.","From the headlines you might think the EV era was over. The early withdrawals of the $7,500 federal tax credit has been painted as the demise of the battery electric car industry. Sales are predicted to plummet, models are being delayed or canceled and auto companies are reviving internal combustion engine models and hybrids.

But those headlines don’t tell the whole story.

First, there was an incredible rush to buy EVs prior to the end of the $7,500 tax credit, which illustrates the appeal of electric cars. Cox Automotive said 438,000 EVs were sold in the third quarter of the year, taking 10.4% of the automotive market for the first time. EVs also have been cited as the main reason for a boost of overall car sales over the past several months. The Los Angeles Times reported national EV sales in July jumped 19% compared with a year earlier. In Southern California’s conservative Orange County, 32% of all new vehicles sold were electric. The market leader in EVs, Tesla, set an all-time sales record in the third quarter of 2025.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, told me there are several reasons to believe any drop-off in EV sales may be short-lived for several reasons.

More affordable EVs coming

Electric cars are more expensive than gasoline-powered models, averaging more than $9,000 than comparable gas models. Stephanie said new models coming online shortly may help close that gap, including the reduced price Tesla Model 3 and Model Y and the new Chevy Bolt, which will sell for less than $30,000.

The redesigned Nissan Leaf also just hit the market at $30,000. Other low-cost models are coming. In addition, she noted that the used EV market will be getting a boost from cars coming off short-term leases of past couple years. More than 50% of EVs are leased; historically, EVs coming off lease have substantially reduced prices. Those models could provide an additional incentive-free boost.

Stephanie also said market research by Cox showed 65% of buyers interested in EVs still planned to buy even without the federal tax credit. In addition, 74% of current EV owners said they intended to buy an EV for their next vehicle.

For current models and new ones coming, Stephanie added that advances in batteries could enhance performance while reducing costs.

More market incentives

Along with new, lower-cost models, automakers are reacting as they would to any market shift. Hyundai dropped the price of its best-selling EV, the Ioniq 5, by up to $10,000. Lucid said it would continue to honor a $7,500 discount for its new Gravity SUV. GM and Ford have suggested they may have a workaround to maintain low-cost leases for EVs.

Even as automakers shift their immediate market strategies, anyone playing in the world market (which is all of them) will need to keep active in EVs. China and Europe are both continuing to move toward full electrification, so long-term competitiveness dictates that the EVs will keep getting better.

The EV future still looks quite bright.

“The domestic market is hungry for sustainable, high-quality recycled aluminum,” said Michael Siemer, Sortera’s CEO.
“For them to be green, they each are going to need an additional billion pounds of scrap aluminum,” Siemer estimated.
Magnets can easily pull out pieces of steel from scrap piles, but aluminum alloys are tricky to sort.
That leaves behind roughly 18 billion pounds of mixed-metal material per year, about 10 billion of which include aluminum alloys, according to Sortera.","The startup Sortera Technologies has raised fresh funding to expand its tech-driven recycling operations — with an eye toward meeting rising U.S. demand for low-carbon aluminum.

Sortera uses advanced sensors and artificial intelligence to sort different types of aluminum found in old car parts and appliances. On Thursday, the company said it raised $45 million to fuel its next phase of growth, including from global investment firm T. Rowe Price Associates, venture capital fund VXI Capital, and Yamaha Motor Ventures, an arm of the Japanese manufacturer.

Sortera’s flagship facility in Markle, Indiana, currently processes about 100 million pounds of shredded metal per year to recover specific alloys — blends of aluminum that contain other elements to make them stronger and more durable. With the new investment, the startup plans to build a second plant next year, in Lebanon, Tennessee, to double its capacity to pick through gleaming scrap heaps.

The expansion comes as the United States is racing to shore up supplies of aluminum.

Part of that is driven by the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel, which have put pressure on U.S. manufacturers to produce more metal. Automakers are also using more lightweight aluminum instead of steel, including in battery-powered cars and hulking Ford F-150 pickup trucks. Data-center developers need more of the metal for their buildings and the technology inside, while some buyers are looking specifically for lower-carbon aluminum to meet decarbonization goals.

The U.S. is now playing catch-up. America’s production of new, primary aluminum has declined significantly in recent decades, and while plans are underway to build two new smelters, neither is expected to be fully on line this decade. Both projects will also need to secure huge amounts of cheap — and ideally clean — electricity at a time when that’s hard to come by.

Recycling aluminum, on the other hand, requires only about 5% of the energy that’s needed to produce the metal in power-hungry smelters. As a result, it’s generally a faster, cheaper, and lower-carbon way of making aluminum products.

“The domestic market is hungry for sustainable, high-quality recycled aluminum,” said Michael Siemer, Sortera’s CEO.

The country’s use of scrap will climb even higher once two new rolling facilities — which shape aluminum into plates, sheets, and coils — ramp up production. Steel Dynamics rolled its first hot coils at a $1.9 billion plant in Mississippi this summer. Novelis, which is partnering with Sortera to use the startup’s rescued aluminum, is slated to bring its $2.5 billion facility on line in Alabama later next year.

“For them to be green, they each are going to need an additional billion pounds of scrap aluminum,” Siemer estimated.

Despite the growing domestic appetite for aluminum, much of what the country recycles still gets exported overseas, particularly when it’s lumped together with other metals like copper, brass, and titanium. Magnets can easily pull out pieces of steel from scrap piles, but aluminum alloys are tricky to sort. That leaves behind roughly 18 billion pounds of mixed-metal material per year, about 10 billion of which include aluminum alloys, according to Sortera.

“We generally scoop it up, put it into ships, and send it to Southeast Asia,” where the metals are sorted by hand, Siemer said of the industry’s approach. ​“Or it’s made into low-value products in America, where you can melt the aluminum down” with the other metals, he added, likening the process to melting a box of colorful crayons into a functional, but less desirable, brown soup.

Sortera’s founders, Nalin Kumar and Manual Garcia, launched the company in 2020 to introduce more precision and automation to this sorting process. After spinning out of an Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy program that focused on recycling metals for lightweight vehicles and aircraft, the startup raised money from firms including Chrysalix Venture Capital and the Bill Gates–affiliated Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Sortera said the funding announced this week brings its total investment to about $120 million.

Other early-stage companies are working on new ways to pluck recyclable materials out of the gobsmacking amounts of garbage we generate every day. Greyparrot, for example, has developed AI camera systems that recycling firms can install to track aluminum cans, glass bottles, and plastic packaging as they move down conveyor belts. The startup Amp uses software-driven robotic systems inside its own plants to automatically sort materials.

But Sortera handles only scrap metal, and it hunts for only specific types of high-quality aluminum alloys — ones that manufacturers like Novelis are typically willing to pay more for. The company’s Indiana facility can also process scrap at high enough volumes to justify handling it domestically, Siemer said.

“They’re getting into a really interesting niche,” said Parker Bovée, who leads waste and recycling research for the consulting firm Cleantech Group. ​“If you can get pure sorted alloys, then you know exactly what you’re dealing with,” which makes the metal more valuable to the companies turning it back into car frames, engine blocks, or complex metal parts.

Bovée said that from an investment standpoint, he considers Sortera’s approach to be higher risk than a software-only solution, since it involves spending more capital to build facilities and machinery. Waste management in general ​“is a difficult industry to break into and make substantial inroads,” he said. But Sortera’s ability to capture sought-after alloys ​“makes them very impressive.”

Siemer added that Sortera will eventually use its technology to sort the other metals found in shredded scrap piles. But for now, he said, ​“We’re building a business on the aluminum.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Sortera_Alloys.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c3fbf561e43b20cfab094d63e25d5a9d,N,,2025-11-20 16:03:20.051134

Since the Region D Water Board meeting, tensions over the proposed Grand Saline reservoir have escalated.","Smoke curled lazily from the kitchen, carrying the sweet weight of brown sugar and spice through the room. An elk and two whitetail deer stared down from the wall, their glass eyes fixed above a Texas flag and a scattering of wooden crosses. Around a circular laminate table, the group of locals bent over a printout titled “The City of Canton: Annual Water Usage vs. Availability Report.” Across from me, behind polarized Ray-Bans, a big beard, and a lattice of tattoos, sat a pitmaster named John Borgstedt. Known to locals by his Facebook username, “BBQ and a Prayer,” he was ready to explain how the fight for his livelihood had become inseparable from the fight against the reservoir and the leaders he believes are selling out their own people.

As John’s wife, Virginia Borgstedt, set plates of steaming barbecue chicken and paprika-dusted potato salad on the table, John began to talk. His story reaches back to a childhood scarred by abuse and years in and out of prison before he rebuilt his life through faith and grit. An oilfield explosion later shattered his body and ended his work in the industry. So he set up on Interstate 20 with a cooler and a cutting board on his tailgate, selling barbecue to whoever stopped.

Here in Van Zandt County, which is an hour east of Dallas and stretches across long fenceline miles of pasture and pine, the proposal to build a new reservoir on Grand Saline Creek ignited a fight over land rights, public trust, and the future of rural East Texas. City officials argue the project is necessary to secure Canton’s long-term water supply, but residents say it’s built on inflated population estimates, misleading data, and a failure to follow state transparency laws. Now, landowners, local organizers, and state lawmakers are pushing back, insisting the reservoir threatens generational homes and livelihoods.

The fight over government transparency in Van Zandt County began February 2025 when local realtor Christy Beckham questioned claims that the county jail was overcrowded, leading her to connect with Borgstedt and another local Laurie Wilson, as officials simultaneously pushed for a costly new courthouse while declining a nearly $10 million state restoration grant. The group—suspecting officials may have been manufacturing crises to justify major spending—began to pull public records, attend town meetings, and share their findings online.

The turning point came in March 2025 when a Texas Historical Commission preservation coordinator publicly corrected county officials’ misleading statements—portions of which were later removed from an official meeting video—galvanizing the trio to expose the incident on Facebook. What began as a modest barbecue-and-scripture page evolved into a watchdog platform as Borgstedt posted documents, meeting clips, and maps that brought widespread attention to concerns of local mismanagement and eroding public trust.

The same summer afternoon in August as my visit with Borgstedt, I wound my way through the backroads of Grand Saline, a small town of just over 3,000, the pastures lush and the kudzu heavy with the late summer rains. Along a fenceline, an American flag snapped in the breeze above a cardboard sign, half-swallowed by wildflowers, that read: “Protect Your Land: Stop Canton’s Dam on Saline Creek.”

I pulled into the parking lot of the New Testament Holiness Apostolic Church. Meeting me outside were Cody and Chain Swain, brothers who grew up along the bends and muddy banks of the Grand Saline Creek Basin. Inside the fellowship hall of the small country church, we sat beneath humming fluorescent lights and they told me about the fight Borgstedt had set in motion.

To understand the fight over the water reservoir, one must take the time to understand Van Zandt County’s geography. Canton lies at its hub, with places like Grand Saline, Wills Point, and Ben Wheeler radiating outward, each a small world tied together by county roads and pastureland. Grand Saline, true to its name, rests over the largest and purest salt dome in the United States, where brine-rich earth has shaped both the economy and identity. Morton Salt owns and continues to operate the vast underground rock-salt mine beneath the Grand Saline Salt Dome in the county.

The populations in these towns number only in the hundreds or a few thousand, places where families have lived on the same plots of land for generations. However, there is a force in Canton that has shaped the county’s fate for decades: First Monday, a monthly flea market billed as the “world’s largest flea market.” Once the lifeblood of Canton, First Monday’s decline—ushered in by online marketplaces and commercialization—has fueled suspicions that city leaders began looking to the reservoir as the town’s next salvation, a lake that could lure outsiders, their wallets, and keep Canton afloat.

This all began in 2004. As Canton officials looked ahead to the city’s projected growth, the question of long-term water security came sharply into focus. At a city meeting that year, the mayor and a hired consultant reviewed the Citizen Advisory Committee’s draft comprehensive plan, noting that Van Zandt County’s growth rate was outpacing the city’s and that water would become harder to secure. With just 5.5 square miles within its boundaries, the city discussed a strategy to manage future water demand. This urgency propelled Canton into a series of evaluations and studies, each step tightening the focus on one truth: The city’s future would hinge on a stark choice between just three imperfect options.

The first path was to buy potable and non-potable water from the nearby city of Tyler, a deal dressed in security but bound by an expiration date with no promise of renewal. The second was to raise or dredge Mill Creek Lake, a shallow 237-acre reservoir for which Canton already had water rights. The third path reached the farthest, presenting the Sabine River—which winds for hundreds of miles through pine and prairie before spilling into the Gulf—as the choice to be dammed, a plan that would erase homes and land, submerging family legacies under the banner of “water rights” for a need that remains unproven.

In 2008, a survey was conducted by Gary Burton Engineering at the City of Canton’s request. The firm evaluated five potential reservoir locations. Two were quickly dismissed as unsuitable, while three—the Grand Saline site included—were examined in more detail. Of these, the Grand Saline site was determined to be the worst option: “Three optional dam sites on Grand Saline Creek were investigated and eliminated from further consideration based on excessive relocation costs for gas wells and pipelines,” the report stated.

The City of Canton based its reservoir plans on the assumption that its population would grow to 34,000 residents by 2065, filling every available space within the city limits and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. (The current population stands at 4,229.) Under that projection, officials claimed the city would face a daily water shortage of 5.78 million gallons. However, Burton’s survey directly contradicted this. Following his survey, Burton pointed out that he reached out to the City of Tyler, a city with a population above 100,000, about 40 miles from Canton, which had agreed to supply Canton with that exact amount. He also contacted the Neches River Authority, which confirmed that at the time there were 25,000 acre-feet of unallocated water rights on Lake Palestine, an existing large freshwater reservoir. With these options on the table, Burton’s survey proved, the idea that Canton would run out of water simply wasn’t true.

While this pursuit to build a new reservoir seems harmless at first glance, Chad Swain pulled up a text message from a neighbor sharing with him a newspaper article that ran in 2009 after the survey was discussed. The article published on March 27th, 2009, read, “A 237-acre reservoir named Mill Creek Lake already exists southeast of Canton, but it is not considered a major draw for fishing or other recreational pursuits. And while the main focus of the new reservoir is water storage, the lake could be tailored to help draw more water enthusiasts to the area already known for its First Monday Trade Days.” This introduced the suspicion that the reservoir project was not solely for the sake of water needs; there were ulterior motives present in the construction of the lake.

In 2017, the City of Canton commissioned an engineering firm to revisit the idea of a reservoir, this time focusing exclusively on the Grand Saline Creek site, despite Burton’s survey finding evidence that this site was not the most advantageous for the community. They acknowledged the earlier engineering concerns but pressed forward with a more detailed evaluation. The report reiterated the high costs tied to moving pipelines, gas wells, and roadways, while also noting the impact on surrounding farmland and existing utilities. Despite these red flags being confirmed again, the Grand Saline site remained under discussion, its viability framed less by technical promise than by the persistence of officials determined to keep the project alive.

On April 22, 2025, Canton quietly filed its water rights permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), but buried in the paperwork was a telling detail: The city wasn’t claiming its own rights to the Sabine. Instead, it invoked a Certificate of Adjudication held by the Sabine River Authority (SRA), meaning any reservoir built would be under SRA’s control, not Canton’s. For residents who were told the project would secure the city’s independence, the revelation stung. The filing, signed by Mayor Lou Ann Berry on April 15, 2025, also included letters from City Manager Lonny Cluck dated February 25, formally notifying Van Zandt County’s four commissioners and setting the stage for the next phase of the reservoir project.

Per TCEQ regulations, Canton’s Grand Saline Reservoir application should have triggered strict public notice requirements: a notice in the local paper, a plain-language summary posted online, and direct communication so residents could understand the project and weigh in. If the rules had been followed, neighbors should have seen clear notices in paper and online, with a summary of the permit’s purpose and impacts. But in this case, neither the Swain brothers, nor any of their neighbors recall receiving a letter, reading a notice in the paper, or otherwise being alerted to the project.

Some landowners around the creek had seen their property appraisals drop significantly in the year or two before the plan for the reservoir was announced. Wilson pulled up a picture of a map composed of pieces of printer paper taped together with a map of the Grand Saline Creek region pieced together. This map that she had prepared was colored pink and yellow, each region representing a different parcel of land painstakingly pulled from the Van Zandt County Appraisal District. The colors told the story plainly: This was not an isolated case, but a widespread reduction in property values. In some areas, families saw their land devalued by over 30 percent, while others faced cuts as steep as 40 percent—tens of thousands of dollars in lost value, suddenly erased from their most important asset. One parcel, long held in the same family, saw its appraisal fall from nearly $1.2 million to just over $600,000, a 46 percent decrease.

Wilson pointed out a telling pattern: While the value of properties all across the county increased, the Van Zandt County Appraisal District lowered the values of the tracts that sit on the footprint of the proposed reservoir. The contrast deepens the suspicion that these devaluations are not isolated adjustments but a coordinated reshaping of the land market in anticipation of Canton’s project.

In a statement provided by Canton City Manager Lonny Cluck, the city emphasized that the Grand Saline Reservoir project had been publicly discussed and documented since its inception around 2009. “The city has always been transparent and has made all required notifications and filings at the local, regional, and state level in connection with the project,” he said in an email. Cluck stated that notices were mailed to affected landowners at the time and that each stage of planning occurred in compliance with the Texas Open Meetings Act, with filings made at the local, regional, and state levels. He rejected the idea that economic development was a motivation behind the project, saying the city viewed the reservoir solely as a long-term water supply option for Canton and neighboring communities.

Mayor Berry emphasized in a statement to the Observer that the city does not currently face an immediate water shortage and stated that the Grand Saline Reservoir had been considered only as a long-term planning option encouraged by the Texas Water Development Board. Berry expressed personal concern about the declining aquifer levels in the region and the possibility that large-scale water projects in neighboring counties could alter groundwater flow, adding that some wells in the area have already become unstable due to manganese concentrations. She also cited rapid residential development from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex as an unpredictable factor. “We can control growth but we can’t stop it. Drill Baby Drill seems to be everyone’s motto including us,” Berry said.

City pumpage records filed with TCEQ show that Canton has no water shortage, only a surplus. The city is permitted to draw over a billion gallons annually, yet from 2017 through 2024, it never once used more than 252 million gallons in a year, averaging less than 20 percent of its available capacity. In fact, 2024 marked the lowest usage in nearly a decade at just 192.8 million gallons, and 2025 is on track to fall even lower. Far from running out of water, Canton currently has the ability to supply five times its present population without adding a single new source, records show.

This fight for the community members was often centered in the fellowship hall of the Swain family church, where Chad and Cody sat shoulder to shoulder. They told me how they called a community meeting at their church in late June; the hall overflowed with neighbors angry at the thought of losing their land to the reservoir. Many of those in attendance signed on to a letter that listed the facts, citing the surveys, the population estimates, and detailing what they saw as the immoral nature of the project. At the back of the room sat Borgstedt, silent and watchful behind his sunglasses. He slipped out the door without a word once the meeting was done, later sending a message to the Swain brothers that read: “I’ve seen enough.”

Following the meeting at the Swain family church on June 29, Borgstedt stepped into the role of public chronicler, especially considering the local papers had failed to cover this issue. His Facebook page became a running ledger of what he was uncovering and what officials would not say. He drew on permits, pumpage totals, and charts to show how the city’s claims about a shortage didn’t add up. By July 30, as notice of a commissioners court meeting went out, Borgstedt was posting documents and analysis for residents to see for themselves. As the county held workshops and townhalls, Borgstedt had primed the community with plain-spoken posts that stripped the technical veneer off city documents.

On August 13, the Texas Water Development Board Region D Water Planning Group was scheduled to hold a meeting, with the Grand Saline Reservoir on the agenda, a couple counties over in the town of Pittsburg. The fight over Canton’s reservoir proposal gained some traction. The day before, state Representative Brent Money—a first-term right-wing Republican—sent a formal letter urging the group to remove all mention of the Grand Saline Creek Reservoir from its 2026 Regional Water Management Plan, citing Canton’s surplus water supply projections through 2060, the availability of lower-impact alternatives like groundwater wells and reuse, and the collapse of regional support for the project.

At the meeting, Borgstedt leaned toward the camera he and Beckham had set up in the conference room in Pittsburg. His voice carried as he ensured the people logging onto the livestream could hear him: “Thank you, everybody, for coming into the live. This is such an important message and this is a very big vote. This is something that is definitely going to change, if not influence, the outcome.” Wilson and other local opponents were there as well, carrying eight years’ worth of water reports compiled into spreadsheets and graphs.

The board meeting that morning drew an unusually large and fervent crowd, filling the board’s biggest room despite the stormy weather and it being a midweek workday. Dozens of residents and landowners rose to speak in defense of their homes, some having traveled over an hour to stand with their neighbors. Representative Money showed up and delivered his own remarks in opposition, as did a staffer from Senator Bob Hall’s office. Their presence underscored the gravity of the moment, signaling that opposition to the project had reached a new level of visibility.

Richard Garza, the Van Zandt County representative to the Region D Water Board, took the floor as the livestream showed Mayor Berry waving to the camera and leaning in to whisper to the man beside him. Garza began plainly: “This situation has turned into a bit of a fiasco, and I don’t feel it was my doing, so I will blame it on the City of Canton.” As he spoke, Berry rose from her chair, moving to the back of the room. Garza then walked the board through the project history—referencing the 2004 meeting, the water studies of 2008 and 2017, and laying out in detail the City of Canton’s misrepresentation of data. What began as a measured presentation of evidence gradually swelled with emotion, Garza’s calm voice giving way to urgency as he spoke of the people around Grand Saline Creek whose homes and land were caught in the balance.

Garza finished with a blistering critique of Canton’s reservoir push, as exclamations of “Amen” and “She’s going to jail” can be heard in the background of the livestream. He argued the city had repeatedly misrepresented data, cycling through engineering firms until they found one that gave them answers they wanted, even though every study referenced the 2008 recommendations. Garza urged the board to take an unprecedented step of opposing Canton’s water rights request, reminding them that while Region D held no legal authority, TCEQ often heeded its recommendations. His voice sharpened as he described the city’s tactics: “This is the lengths the elected officials of the City of Canton will go to in order to get their way. … They cannot justify their population. The data and the math are not on their side.” Then, in one of the meeting’s most searing moments, he declared: “I’m tired of them—the City of Canton—molesting the citizens of Van Zandt County.”

At the end of the nearly 4-hour meeting, the people of Van Zandt County secured what many described as a major victory for their land, water, and community. In a unanimous vote, the board members removed the Grand Saline Creek Reservoir from the list of alternative water sources for Canton and issued formal opposition to the TCEQ. For those who had packed the meeting hall, it was a validation of their voices. For John Borgstedt and his team, who had spent the last few months gathering documents, speaking with neighbors, and pressing the board for transparency, the decision marked victory.

Since the Region D Water Board meeting, tensions over the proposed Grand Saline reservoir have escalated. On August 15, Borgstedt issued a call to the Van Zandt County attorneys to help pursue the legal removal of Mayor Berry via a state statute that allows a district judge to remove a mayor for official misconduct. Organizers allege city leaders failed to uphold their legal duties and have pledged to provide documents and evidence to support their case. On August 20, Governor Greg Abbott added a proposal to protect East Texas aquifers to this year’s second special legislative session agenda, marking a significant development in the ongoing fight over water rights. In the same session, Representative Money filed House Bill 162, aimed at limiting eminent domain abuse by prohibiting cities and counties from seizing land outside their jurisdictions and closing loopholes that enable cross-boundary acquisitions. Money’s bill didn’t pass.

On October 31, after months of advocacy and meetings, the Canton City Council voted unanimously to withdraw its application for the Grand Saline Reservoir, formally ending the city’s pursuit of the project after more than a decade of planning. In a media release, Berry stated that shifting political support, renewed public opposition, and changing regional conditions contributed to the council’s decision to let the project “go to the wayside.” Cluck, the city manager, noted that the project initially carried broad municipal and county support, and expressed disappointment that, in the city’s view, the support eroded under political pressure rather than changing water-resource needs.

The city’s withdrawal of the reservoir application may mark a turning point, but no one here is calling the fight finished. The Swain brothers have heard the story of Marvin Nichols, a North Texas aquifer that was similarly contested. They remember stories of men their age, who stood in their town halls, voices thin with age, warning their children to hold the line long after they were gone. That is the inheritance of Cody and Chad Swain, and of Van Zandt County. And though the permit has been pulled, the cardboard signs stay staked in tall grass. Because there, the fight is not a burden but a birthright, passed down like the land from one generation to the next, and the land remains with those who love it long enough to remain.",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stopthedam4.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:29.896603

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday announced the availability of $6.5 billion in new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funding for water systems, along with an additional $550 million for states, and approved five new federal loans supporting major water projects in Texas, Illinois, Oregon, and Florida.

The funding is available through a rolling application process. EPA officials said the WIFIA program continues to serve as a critical financing tool to help communities modernize water systems, protect public health, and reduce long-term costs.

“Modernizing and maintaining water infrastructure is essential to ensuring clean and safe water for all Americans and advancing EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative,” said Jessica Kramer, EPA’s assistant administrator for water. “Communities use these competitive loans to upgrade water infrastructure to benefit residents and businesses while loan payments reimburse the U.S. Treasury.”

The agency’s 2025 Notice of Funding Availability marks the ninth round of WIFIA financing since the program’s launch during the first Trump administration. This year’s round designates $6.5 billion for WIFIA loans and $550 million for state infrastructure financing authorities through the State WIFIA program. EPA is currently accepting letters of interest for both programs.

EPA said priority will be given to projects that support safe drinking water, reduce pollution in U.S. waterways, bolster energy development, advance state and local water priorities, spur innovation, and promote economic growth.

Newly Approved WIFIA Loans

EPA also announced approval of five loans for projects aimed at improving wastewater treatment, drinking water resilience, and system reliability:

Fort Worth, Texas — A $347 million loan to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment systems and build a new water reclamation facility to support future growth and expand water reuse for industrial and irrigation purposes.

Pflugerville, Texas — A $176 million loan for a series of drinking water and wastewater improvements, including a new wastewater treatment plant, expansion of collection systems and water main rehabilitation. This is the city’s second WIFIA loan.

Joliet, Illinois — An $87 million loan to help the city shift from a stressed aquifer to a Lake Michigan water supply and modernize its distribution system to reduce water loss. The city has received three WIFIA loans totaling $395 million.

Ashland, Oregon — A $73 million loan to build a new drinking water treatment plant that will provide a safer and more resilient supply for the rural community.

Wilton Manors, Florida — A $28 million loan to replace aging water mains, rehabilitate wastewater lift stations and force mains, and upgrade stormwater drainage to reduce failure risks, particularly during severe weather.

About WIFIA

Created by Congress in 2014, the WIFIA program provides long-term, low-cost loans for nationally and regionally significant water infrastructure projects. The program leverages federal financing with state, local and private investment to accelerate upgrades and reduce overall project costs.

EPA says its rolling selection process allows a broad range of borrowers — including small communities and private entities — to participate. To date, the agency has announced $22 billion in WIFIA financing for 141 projects, supporting more than 160,000 jobs nationwide.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/1120EPDam.jpeg,N,,2025-11-20 16:02:00.160781

This interagency guidance, known as “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions,” represented a three-way pact among the FDIC, Fed Board, and the OCC. The guidance imposed burdensome climate-related financial risk principles that bank managers were expected to implement. Specifically, it required large financial institutions – namely banks and asset managers – with more than $100 billion in assets to adopt a set of government-prescribed climate risk management principles.

These principles establish how bank leaders should manage risks associated with climate change threats. They include protocols for securing financial assets against physical risks from severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Large institutions were also expected to establish standards for mitigating risks tied to organizational transitions from climate change, such as shifting from fossil fuel reliance to renewable energy via wind and solar power.

These guidance principles generated fierce pushback from Republicans in Congress. In April 2024, House Republicans advanced a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval against each regulator’s principles. Members of the House Financial Services Committee successfully adopted the resolutions to nullify the Fed Board’s, FDIC’s, and OCC’s principles.

Unfortunately, the CRAs only advanced out of committee and were never voted on by the full House. They were very unlikely to be signed into law by President Joe Biden at the time. With Trump back in office, this new change in executive branch policy represents a major turn away from the previous ESG-aligned regulatory regime.

For context, administrative guidance is not the same as actual rules and regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act, § 553 sec (A), enables guidance manuals such as these principles to bypass the notice-and-comment process. Guidance represents sub-regulatory content that allows regulators to issue interpretations of their policy positions and signal what they expect from regulated parties.

Agency guidance, including the above principles, is not legally binding. The trio of agencies claimed that they adopted the guidance within the boundaries of their enabling statues. To this end, “the agencies did not incorporate suggestions for changes to the draft principles that extend beyond the agencies’ statutory mandates relating to safety and soundness,” according to the principles.

The principles are non-legislative rules meant to encourage large financial institutions to adopt risk-adjusted protocols. They effectively projected the Biden administration’s environmental policy position on the perceived threats of climate change.

However, earlier this year, I made the case that the three agencies exceeded their statutory missions by imposing these principles. In my public policy memo for State Policy Network (SPN), I explain how the interagency guidance intrudes on large financial institutions’ internal risk management protocols.

Though nominally voluntary, this guidance was crafted to shift the behavior of the largest financial institutions toward treating climate change as a serious systemic threat to their financial interests. The guidance directs the boards of large banks to “allocate appropriate resources to support climate-related financial risk management.” Such behavior would trigger a domino effect, prompting smaller and mid-sized institutions to mimic the big banks under these principles.

Contrary to the agencies’ claims, these principles exceed their statutory authority to ensure safety and soundness. As I explain in my SPN memo, it’s not the role of financial regulators to equate external climate change risks with traditional risks facing financial deposits.

In fact, these regulatory bodies oversee how banks manage internal financial risks facing depositors. Such risks are concrete, grounded in detectable issues that customers may encounter when preserving their savings and assets.

For example, the FDIC’s risk management manual only addresses the threat of real environmental risks, rather than hypothetical climate threats. It suggests banks should consider these instructions to avoid noncompliance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.

Similarly, the OCC’s supervisory authority for banks begins and ends with mitigating risks to consumer interests and access to reputable services. Hypothetical climate change risks fall well outside the agency’s mandate. And the Fed Board requires bank holding companies to maintain a risk management framework. It does not adopt its own set of risk management principles to combat climate change or anything else.

We should encourage more deregulatory efforts across the federal government to eliminate mandatory ESG policies. While such rules and regulations are a primary focus of regulatory reformers in the current administration, many low-profile guidance documents flying under the radar require attention. If not for the congressional uproar against these climate risk principles, the current leadership at the FDIC, OCC, and Fed Board may have still been enforcing this problematic guidance. Bank regulators must focus only on concrete, demonstrable financial risks and allow banks to manage those risks as they deem fit.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ESG-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 16:01:40.544996

This move marks a major reduction of a program established over 15 years ago. The Proposal drew over 53,000 comments from diverse stakeholders, including industry, environmental groups, state officials, tribes, and the public. Environmental organizations opposed the rollback, emphasizing the GHGRP’s role in climate policy, transparency, and federal incentives.[5] They argued EPA’s authority under section 114(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) supports maintaining the program, warning that its removal could hinder climate risk assessment and disproportionately harm vulnerable communities.[6]

Industry feedback was mixed. Many acknowledged the GHGRP’s benefits for emissions management, investor disclosures, and global market compliance, while criticizing EPA claims of cost savings.[7] Industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that the costs of rescinding—such as disruption of ongoing projects and investments—far outweigh the purported savings.[8] Some supported EPA’s narrower interpretation of its Clean Air Act authority and suggested a targeted[9] or voluntary[10] approach instead.

If finalized, the rule would take effect 60 days after publication. Given the significant public concern, legal challenges are likely, especially in light of recent court rulings emphasizing independent interpretation of EPA’s authority under the CAA.[11] The outcome remains uncertain, with potential implications for federal and state climate programs that rely on GHGRP data.[12]

Nov. 19 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering delaying for one or two years its proposed cuts in incentives for imported biofuels amid pressure from U.S. refiners who argue the move could raise costs and tighten fuel supplies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The delay now under discussion could please domestic oil refiners that have invested in the bio-based diesel sector but would risk frustrating U.S. farmers and biofuel producers.

The proposal for the Environmental Protection Agency to slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels was initially pitched this year as part of Trump's ""America First"" energy agenda, aimed at boosting domestic production and reducing reliance on foreign supply, and was meant to take effect Jan. 1.

The Environmental Protection Agency is now weighing a plan to delay implementation of that proposal until 2027 or 2028, the sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The EPA said it is reviewing public comments ahead of issuing final rules in the coming months. The agency declined to comment on whether it is considering a delay. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into next year's congressional elections.

Under the proposed cuts in credits for imports, the EPA would allocate only half as many tradable renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones. The shift has significant implications for bio-based diesel, which relies on imports to meet federal mandates.

The decision on a possible delay is one of several high-profile regulatory moves by the administration that the fuel industry is closely watching.

Others include finalizing 2026 biofuel blending mandates, determining whether to allow year-round sales of gasoline blended with 15% ethanol, or E15, and deciding how or whether to require larger refiners to compensate for exempted gallons under the small refinery waiver program.

The protracted U.S. government shutdown and efforts to resolve a logjam of small refiner requests for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws have also contributed to delays in resolving regulatory moves related to biofuels, the sources said.

Plastipak, Katoen Natie Expand Capital Region Facilities

In the Capital Region, east of Lafayette, Plastipak Packaging Inc. is expanding its Rapides Parish manufacturing facility — a $53.8 million, 200,000-square-foot expansion to add warehouse space and up to five new production lines. The warehouse expansion will provide Plastipak with additional space to store both raw materials and finished goods. The new production lines will include conveyor and compression systems, molds, labeling and printing systems, while planned upgrades to existing lines will increase the use of recycled plastic, enhancing efficiency and sustainability.

“Since Plastipak began construction of its Pineville plant in 2003, our team has been extremely impressed with and appreciative of the collaboration and support from local and state government officials and local organizations,” said Plastipak Holdings President and CEO Ed Morgan. “The long-term support and business-friendly environment in Louisiana has allowed Plastipak to expand the facility several times over the past 20-plus years, and allows us to announce the current investment. We look forward to increasing our manufacturing and recycling capabilities in Pineville and supporting our customers in Louisiana.”

The company is expected to create 15 direct new jobs while retaining 340 current positions. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 25 indirect new jobs, for a total of 40 potential new jobs in the Central Region. The state of Louisiana has offered Plastipak Packaging an incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart and participation in the state’s Retention and Modernization Program. In addition, Plastipak is expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

Plastipak last expanded its Pineville facility in 2017 with a $15 million investment. The current project is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2026.

Plastipak Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Plastipak Holdings Inc., is a global designer, manufacturer and recycler of plastic packaging containers and performs for some of the world’s largest consumer products companies. Plastipak operates 38 manufacturing and five recycling sites in the United States, South America and Europe, with a total of over 5,400 employees. Plastipak was founded in 1967 and is headquartered in Plymouth, Michigan.

Also this week, in the capital city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a groundbreaking was held for the $25 million expansion of Katoen Natie Baton Rouge, LLC. Located at the company’s Baton Rouge Polymers Terminal, this project adds a logistics facility to support the growing specialty chemicals and advanced materials industries, strengthening the Capital Region’s position as a hub for industrial distribution and manufacturing.

Katoen Natie is expected to create 13 direct new jobs, while retaining 29 current positions in East Baton Rouge Parish. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional nine indirect new jobs, for a total of 22 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“With this project Katoen Natie reconfirms that Baton Rouge is key within its global network of high end logistics and added value platforms for the chemical industry,” said Katoen Natie’s President of Specialty Chemicals Sam Dhollander. “Louisiana continues to be a region where chemicals and petrochemicals continue to have and find a home in an ever more challenging global economy.”

The project includes a new 300,000-square-foot warehouse for the storage and repackaging of titanium dioxide (TiO₂), amongst other products, which is produced in Lake Charles and used in coatings, plastics and other industrial applications. The expansion reflects Katoen Natie’s continued investment in Louisiana. Construction is expected to be completed by October 2026, with operations beginning the following month.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act.
Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.
They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.
Environmental Defense Fund Associate Vice President Will McDow stated Monday that the new proposed WOTUS rule from the Trump administration that will redefine which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act Protections.","Updated at 8 a.m. Thursday to include the link to the Federal Register, which published the proposed rules Thursday after the story posted, and public comment information.

The two federal agencies with jurisdiction over navigable waterways have published amendments to the existing “waters of the United States” rule that they say will “establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition” of the term, and a public comment period has opened.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Army’s changes have heightened worry among conservation groups that federal protections for isolated wetlands might be weakened further than they were soon after the 2023 Supreme Court decision that found wetlands must be connected by surface water to a navigable body of water to fall under the 1972 Clean Water Act.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers said in a release Monday that the newly proposed changes were to “fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

As part of the announcement, leadership posted the prepublication notice they planned to submit to the Federal Register, which was published Thursday, starting a 45-day public comment period.

Comments must be submitted by Jan. 5, 2026, and identified by Docket ID No. EPA–HQ– OW–2025–0322, through www.regulations.gov, by email to OW-Docket@epa.gov, or mail to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA Docket Center, Water Docket, Mail Code 28221T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460.

Language in the Clean Water Act states that the “term ‘navigable waters’ means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” However, the act doesn’t define what “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, actually are, leaving the EPA and Corps to determine the geographic scope of the rule.

Over the last five decades, pushback and litigation have forced the two agencies to revise the definition several times.

The current regulatory definition, according to the EPA, was put in place in September 2023 to align with the May 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the Sackett v EPA lawsuit.

The Sacketts filed the lawsuit after the agency ordered the Idaho couple to restore where they had begun backfilling with dirt the section of their property that the EPA considered to be wetlands of a nearby navigable waterbody. The judges sided with the Sacketts that federally protected wetlands must have an obvious connection to waterbodies like streams, oceans, rivers and lakes.

To conform to the Sackett decision, the EPA and Army amended in September 2023 the latest final rule, which had been put in place that January.

EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle shared with Washington, D.C., lawmakers Monday afternoon an overview of the proposed rules.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief and happiness from farmers, ranchers, other landowners, governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of, and would allow individuals to know whether or not there’s a ‘water of the United States’ without having to go hire an attorney or a consultant, having to pay someone to Tell them,” Zeldin said Monday during the announcement livestreamed on the EPA’s YouTube.

The EPA secretary explained that the proposal “includes practical, common-sense revisions that will make a real difference,” and adds definitions for what he called “key terms” such as “’relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately limit the scope of what is consistent with” the Sackett case.

“We’re establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters, either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow. We’re adding a new exclusion for groundwater and revising exclusions for certain ditches prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems,” Zeldin continued. “We’re incorporating locally familiar terminology such as wet season to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS. And we’re strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.”

He explained that the proposed rules were developed based on input from multiple sources, including preproposal recommendations, docket information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Telle addressed the audience after Zeldin.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act. Did it apply to them? Did it not? The definition of that term has been often abused, sometimes stretched beyond recognition over time, and it’s left Americans uncertain about whether they were complying with the Clean Water Act or not,” he said Monday, adding that “under President Trump’s leadership, the EPA and army Civil Works, which oversees the Corps of Engineers, are kicking off the formal process that will give American certainty about their property once and for all.”

Several Republican officials thanked Zeldin from the podium for initiating the proposed amendments including West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey who said that “for too long there’s been great deal of uncertainty” about the WOTUS rule.

“Unfortunately, it left many people holding the bag. Farmers, contractors, small business owners guessing whether their ephemeral stream or a backyard ditch was going to be classified as a waters of the United States rule and potentially subject them to significant penalties,” he continued.

Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.

Conservation groups have been vocal about these revisions opening up isolated wetlands to development and degradation since the announcement was made.

“Wetlands are the lifeblood of our coast, and should be held to the highest standards of protection,” North Carolina Coastal Federation Coastal Advocate Kerri Allen explained. “The wetlands most impacted by these proposed rollbacks are the very wetlands that hold water during storms and help protect downstream waters. With the proposed changes, our coast will face irrevocable damage that impacts not only our wildlife and fisheries, but also our coastal economy and communities.” The Coastal Federation publishes Coastal Review.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said Monday in a statement that this proposed rule, if adopted, “could have catastrophic ramifications for communities already plagued by flooding, water quality concerns, and drinking water shortages. After critical, longstanding protections for clean water and wetlands were drastically narrowed by the Sackett decision, we need stronger protections, not weaker, to safeguard our communities and environment.”

League of Conservation Voters Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote had a similar reaction.

“The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies,” Foote said.

“In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.

On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request with the department arguing its justification for another extension was based on outdated assessments of the Midwestern grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, of its energy reserves heading into the winter.

The initial order, which extended operations at the J.H. Campbell coal plant from its planned closure on June 1 until August 21, initially argued the plant’s resources were needed to prevent blackouts at homes and businesses amid high demand over the summer, despite projections from the grid operator which determined it would have enough resources to meet demand from consumers.

The department’s latest order, issued Tuesday, extends operations until February 17, 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation had yet to issue its reliability assessment for winter 2025-2026, assessments from the previous two years had presented concerns on whether Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s energy reserves would be sufficient in “above-normal conditions.”

However, the 2025-2026 assessment was released hours before the order was issued, with Nessel arguing its contents completely negate Wright’s arguments justifying an extension.

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.

The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods

“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”

According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

California's EV adoption reached a new record in the third quarter.

The consortium's EV charging stations are located at sites with amenities such as restaurants and driver lounges.

Ionna, the public fast-charging consortium backed by eight major automakers including General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota, said Thursday it will increase its investment in California over the next three years to serve the state’s growing number of EV owners.

The joint venture plans to invest $250 million in California through 2029, and has now contracted more than 1,000 charging bays there. That means California will account for nearly a quarter of Ionna’s planned 4,000 chargers nationwide, which is unsurprising for the country’s largest EV market, where a record 29.1% of new cars sold in the third quarter were electric.

Reliable, high-speed charging stations with basic amenities like food, restrooms and a place to decompress or work are less common but growing in the U.S. Ionna’s whole business model focuses on placing stations where drivers already tend to stop, including chains like Wawa and Sheetz. In some locations, it’s also building its own flagship “rechargeries” with pet-friendly lounges, Wi-Fi, bathrooms and vending machines.

That said, “contracted” sites mean the actual deployment of the chargers could still be months or years away. These are locations where the company may have already signed agreements with site hosts like shopping centers or gas stations, but construction may not have started yet due to local permitting processes and coordination with utility companies.

Even so, Ionna’s pace suggests the rollout may move faster than expected. Despite the usual bottlenecks in permitting and utility hookups, the company has expanded quickly: less than a year after opening its first Rechargery in Apex, North Carolina, it now operates 40 stations with 384 charging ports nationwide, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center.

I tested one of Ionna’s newer stations in Scranton, Pennsylvania, this summer, and it was the most seamless charging stop I’ve had this year. The 400-kilowatt chargers were located within a Sheetz gas station, with good lighting, clean restrooms and plenty of food options. Charging the 2026 BMW iX I was driving at the time was as simple as checking out at a shopping mall. I just tapped my card, plugged the cable in, and 15 minutes later, I had enough range added to get back on the road.

That experience is improving as five of the eight founding automakers now support plug and charge access at Ionna stations. Drivers of electric BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and Mercedes models can simply plug in without handling payment or authentication. Ionna says Ford and Rivian vehicles now get plug-and-charge access as well.

Even though EV sales may continue to grow unevenly with the rollback of the tax credits and end of the fuel economy rules, rest assured that the infrastructure to support them is growing stronger. With more such stations coming online every week, even your grandparents can soon become bona fide EV roadtrippers.

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.

The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods

“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”

According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

Nessel previously filed petitions for review to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for the past two extensions. The court has yet to issue a ruling.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 15:01:08.927806

Norwegian battery company to build $3.2 billion synthetic graphite plant in Ontario's 'automotive alley' Back to video

Article content

Article content

The Vianode AS plant is expected to initially create 300 jobs, and as many as 1,000 jobs once it ramps up to its full production capacity of 150,000 tonnes per year. A company spokesperson said the decision to build in St. Thomas was made well before the United States-Canada trade war started after a years-long due diligence process.

Vianode also has an offtake relationship with General Motors Co., which until last month was building electric delivery vans in Ingersoll, Ont., about a 40-minute drive east. GM recently ended production of the van due to poor sales and the company in recent weeks has held talks with workers and government officials to explore future options for the plant.

Project will create up to 1,000 jobs and support Ontario’s growing electric vehicle, energy and defence manufacturing sectors

ST. THOMAS — The Ontario government has secured an investment of $3.2 billion from Vianode, a leading global manufacturer of synthetic graphite, to establish a new, state-of-the-art facility in St. Thomas. The investment marks Vianode’s entrance into the North American market and is a major milestone in the government’s plan to build the most competitive, resilient and self-reliant economy in the G7, helping to protect Ontario’s economy and Ontario workers in the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty. Vianode’s investment will create nearly 300 new, good-paying jobs in its initial phase, with 1,000 jobs expected once the facility is at full operational capacity, generating broad economic benefits across southwestern Ontario.

“Today’s announcement is a historic milestone for southwestern Ontario and a major win for workers, creating good-paying manufacturing jobs today and for generations to come,” said Premier Doug Ford. “We’re proud to welcome Vianode to St. Thomas as we strengthen our province’s competitive advantage in a critical industry and build the most competitive, resilient, self-reliant economy in the G7.”

Synthetic graphite is essential to EV batteries, nuclear reactors, semiconductors, aerospace and defence systems, steelmaking and other strategic industries. By onshoring production, Ontario is not only creating positions at the St. Thomas facility but enabling tens of thousands of additional jobs across the supply chain, from mining and refining to battery manufacturing, research, transportation and advanced manufacturing. The government’s investment will anchor a domestic ecosystem that strengthens Ontario’s industrial capacity and long-term economic resilience.

As the first large-scale low-emission synthetic graphite facility in North America, this investment will also play a key role in displacing global reliance on China, which currently controls more than 80 per cent of the global production of this critical component.

“With economic uncertainty undermining global supply chains, Ontario continues to stand as the stable and reliable economic partner that our allies are looking for,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “As demand for synthetic graphite ramps up at home and abroad, Vianode’s investment will position the province as a leading supplier for strategic industries, ensuring that Ontario’s economy and workers benefit for years to come.”

The St. Thomas facility is being constructed in a multi-phased approach that will ultimately reach up to 150,000 tons of annual capacity — enough synthetic graphite to supply roughly two million EVs each year. To support Vianode’s commitment and the generational benefits of the project to the province’s manufacturing sector, the Ontario government is providing a loan of up to $670 million subject to a definitive agreement to support the site.

“Today marks an important step towards a resilient North American battery supply chain,” said Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode. “Ontario and the city of St. Thomas have been strong partners from day one, and Via TWO will bring industrial-scale, low-emission graphite to market through a phased build-out that supports customers, communities and the clean-energy transition.”

With U.S. tariffs impacting workers and businesses, the Ontario government is protecting the province by building the most resilient, self-reliant and competitive economy in the G7. Last year, Ontario attracted a historic $39 billion in investment from over 400 companies, creating nearly 25,000 good-paying jobs.

The Detroit Free Press reports that Avancez, an Oakland County-based assembler of components for GM’s BT1-based EVs, is indefinitely laying off 143 workers. The move comes as a direct result of production cuts at the GM Factory Zero in Michigan, also known as the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant.

The supplier pinned the decision squarely on its primary customer in a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) notice filed earlier this month. It stated the layoffs, impacting mostly UAW-represented assembly and sequencing workers in Hazel Park, stem from ""the sudden and unexpected cancellation of our primary customer’s second shift."" Greater advance notice proved impossible, the notice argued, due to these ""unforeseeable business circumstances."" The layoffs begin December 5th, leaving workers with little time to adjust. Following the terminations, the facility’s headcount will drop to roughly 230 employees.

Factory Zero builds the core of GM’s current electric lineup, including the GMC Hummer EV, Chevy Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Compounding the situation for the Avancez workforce is their unresolved status with the UAW. Employees achieved union recognition in June, but they have not yet secured a first contract. This leaves them without critical protections, such as formal bumping rights. Labor expert Marick Masters of Wayne State University explained the precarious position. ""Without [a contract], the default is management has the right to set those terms and conditions,"" Masters said. The layoffs proceed in the absence of the job security a ratified agreement would typically provide, highlighting the real-world consequences of GM’s production recalibration as it navigates shifting EV demand.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Factory-Zero-GMC-Hummer-EV-Prooduction-Start-001.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 14:02:50.395442

Dive Brief:

San Antonio’s municipal electric utility, CPS Energy, on Tuesday issued a request for proposals to acquire 600 MW of solar generation through a power purchase agreement.

The utility said in a release that the procurement aligns with its Vision 2027 generation plan, “which aims to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the greater San Antonio area.”

CPS Energy has over 1 GW of solar capacity operating in the area. The utility said it plans to announce a battery storage RFP by the end of this year to add to the 470 MW of storage it has already contracted.

Dive Insight:

Mark Stover, executive director of the Texas Solar+Storage Association, noted that solar “has been the fastest growing power source in Texas for several years, with roughly 6,000 MW added to the grid over the past year alone.”

“This growth, especially when paired with the strong growth in battery storage, has increased grid reliability and helped to drive affordability,” Stover said.

While Texas remains a nationwide leader in renewable energy deployment, recent policy shifts by the Trump administration have made those assets – particularly solar and wind – more difficult to deploy.

Solar and storage projects in Texas account for nearly 40% of 116 GW of projects that the Solar Energy Industries Association said are “at risk of being targeted by the administration” because they have not received all necessary federal, state and local permits.

CPS Energy is within the territory overseen by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas, which has a nearly 100-GW interconnection queue of solar projects without a signed agreement, said Joshua Rhodes, an energy research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a City of Austin Electric Utility Commissioner.

Given that fact, plus “the coming rollback in federal tax support of renewables, it is probably an excellent time to be shopping for Black Friday deals on renewables in the ERCOT market right now,” Rhodes said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Fu0NllaOs5uq0dXpncQ4hrmGtrbXKfGxvRza6fv-dWE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01ODcyMTY3NTQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-20 14:03:30.692215

ST. THOMAS, Ontario, November 20, 2025 – Invest Ontario welcomes an anticipated investment of $3.2 billion from Vianode, a Norwegian producer of sustainable synthetic anode graphite, to establish its first North American facility in St. Thomas, Ontario.

As demand for graphite increases across strategic industries, Ontario has the opportunity to capture share in a market dominated by few players. This will diversify options for global manufacturers and help reduce the reliance on imports for Canadian companies.

Today marks an important step towards a resilient North American battery supply chain. Ontario and the city of St. Thomas have been strong partners from day one, and Via TWO will bring industrial-scale, low-emission graphite to market through a phased build-out that supports customers, communities and the clean-energy transition.

Burkhard Straube

CEO of Vianode

The St. Thomas facility would be North America’s first large-scale, low-emission synthetic graphite plant. Vianode expects that the plant would create around 300 new jobs in the initial phase, and up to 1,000 at full capacity. It would play a crucial role in securing domestic supply of a key commodity used in manufacturing, defence and energy, marking a major step towards building a resilient, sovereign critical mineral supply chain in Ontario.

Today’s announcement is a historic milestone for southwestern Ontario and a major win for workers, creating good-paying manufacturing jobs today and for generations to come. We’re proud to welcome Vianode to St. Thomas as we strengthen our province’s competitive advantage in a critical industry and build the most competitive, resilient, self-reliant economy in the G7.

Hon. Doug Ford

Synthetic graphite is a versatile critical resource increasingly in demand globally. The material forms the anode, one of the key components of lithium-ion batteries, and is essential to semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems and steel production.

Through the use of proprietary technology, the company produces high-performance synthetic anode graphite with up to 90% lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional methods, contributing to a more sustainable value chain.

According to Vianode, ground preparation works are underway to enable start of production in 2028. Planned expansions would bring the Ontario plant’s total capacity to as many as 150,000 tons of synthetic graphite annually.

With economic uncertainty undermining global supply chains, Ontario continues to stand as the stable and reliable economic partner that our allies are looking for. As demand for synthetic graphite ramps up at home and abroad, Vianode’s investment will position the province as a leading supplier for strategic industries, ensuring that Ontario’s economy and workers benefit for years to come.

The Protect Martindale Brightwood Coalition (PMBC) gathered community leaders on Nov. 17 to continue speaking out against the proposal for a new data center in the neighborhood. Metrobloks, a data center developer, proposed a location at the intersection of 25th Street and Sherman Drive, but neighborhood advocates say the center will do more harm than good.

What about the environment?

Long-time resident Carrie Harris has strong ties to the neighborhood. Her husband and his parents grew up there, she raised her four children there and she recently moved back to the area.

“This project poses serious and long-term risks that far outweigh any potential benefits,” Harris said, citing the anticipated pollutants from the data center.

“A 24/7 industrial operation of this magnitude will inevitably bring noise, heat and light pollution,” Harris said.

Martindale Brightwood Environmental Justice Collaborative (EJC) Chair Elizabeth Gore said the neighborhood has made significant progress to correct environmental issues, and they do not want to go backward.

“Nothing that they’re going to bring is going to be helpful to our neighborhood,” Gore said. “We want clean air, water and soil – no data center.”

For 16 years, the Collaborative has worked to address issues such as contaminated soil and water, Gore added.

“We have lost a lot of neighbors already to contamination,” Gore said. “Our children are suffering from learning disabilities based on lead in the soil. Why would we want a humming noise all day? Why would we want any kind of negative problems in our neighborhood?”

In addition to the demand for electricity, data centers require large amounts of water to cool hardware which can put a strain on local water supply and “disrupt local ecosystems,” according to MIT News.

“We are working very hard to keep our environment safe. So, we at the Environmental Justice Collaborative, we say no to the data center,” Gore said. “We say no land use for Metrobloks.”

Metrobloks is promoting the Indianapolis location as a “Midwestern Digital hub” with access to metro areas such as Chicago, Toronto and Cleveland, according to their website. The company also claims a “low environmental risk profile” to the area.

Will the data center bring jobs?

One Voice board member Immanuel Ivey said the data center will not have lasting economic benefits for residents and it does not align with the goals of the city-certified Martindale Brightwood Quality of Life Plan.

“While the project may generate short-term construction jobs, these opportunities are temporary and there is no assurance or indication that local residents will be prioritized when hiring.”

Harris said developments should enhance the neighborhood and provide long-term economic improvement, but this project will not do that.

“We know from experience the local jobs promises almost never materialize,” said One Voice Vice President Cierra Johnson.

“The community stands firm that this project would derail years of community-led revitalization, undermine quality-of-life plans, while blocking plans for healthier, community-driven development,” according to a statement released by PMBC.

Do residents’ voices matter?

What has been most concerning to community members is their lack of inclusion in the development process. Ivey observed that here has been little community engagement thus far.

“We seek projects that align with our vision, build sustainable economic opportunity and truly support the future of our residents and neighborhood of Martindale Brightwood,” Ivey said.

Harris urge elected officials, planning boards and community leaders to reject the data center proposal, saying the community deserves better. She said many residents, like herself, have not been adequately informed about or invited to the decision-making process.

“Our community deserves development that aligns with our values, development that protects our environment, enhances our neighborhoods and offers real lasting economic opportunity for residents,” Harris said. “This project does none of these. We stand united and we ask that our concerns be taken serious right now and throughout every step of any future review process.”

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its latest outlook, providing a clear picture of how global and U.S. energy markets may shift through 2026. These updated projections highlight important changes in oil prices, gasoline and diesel costs, natural gas trends, and U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.

The chart below shows the notable forecast changes reported by EIA.

According to the EIA, global oil inventories are expected to keep rising through 2026, putting downward pressure on international oil prices. Brent crude oil is forecast to average $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 per barrel for the full year. Although prices are projected to decrease, the 2026 forecast is still $3 higher than last month’s estimate, mainly because of updated expectations related to China’s inventory levels and global sanctions placed on Russia.

In the U.S. fuel market, retail gasoline and diesel prices are expected to fall in 2026, supported by lower crude oil prices. EIA forecasts that gasoline will average below $3.00 per gallon, marking a 10% decline from 2024. Diesel prices are expected to fall to $3.50 per gallon, which is 7% lower compared with 2024 averages. These declines may help reduce costs for transportation, agriculture, and daily consumers.

Natural gas is expected to follow a different trend. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to nearly $3.90 per MMBtu this winter, driven by seasonal heating demand. For 2026, natural gas prices are expected to average $4.00 per MMBtu, a 16% increase from 2025. The rise is tied to higher LNG exports and limited production growth, which are tightening supply.

LNG exports remain one of the strongest areas of growth. The United States is expected to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in 2025, which is 25% more than last year. Faster-than-expected expansion at Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana prompted an upward revision in export forecasts. By 2026, U.S. LNG exports are expected to grow an additional 10%, strengthening America’s role in global energy supply.

How to apply Applications for Indiana’s Energy Assistance Program opened on Oct. 1 and close at 5 p.m. April 20.","Despite a holdup in grant awards due to the federal government shutdown, a Southern Indiana agency is continuing its work connecting people to energy assistance.

Brad Wood, executive director of Ohio Valley Opportunities, said the agency served around 5,700 Southern Indiana households last season under the state’s Energy Assistance Program.

That’s a federally funded operation that provides annual payments to help people who meet certain criteria with heating and electric bills.

The EAP is aimed to help people bridge the gap. It doesn’t cover a whole season and maybe not even an entire bill.

But Wood said this and other programs Ohio Valley Opportunities offers can be critical in helping families facing financial hardship.

“Often they’re on the brink of disaster, and it enables them to achieve self sufficiency,"" he said.

And though the 43-day federal government shutdown caused delays in energy assistance in some areas, Wood said his organization is still working with a surplus from last season, and said other programs are ongoing.

“We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that families are not in crisis and receive the services that they need,” he said.

How it works

Ohio Valley Opportunities serves five counties through the Energy Assistance Program, including Clark and Floyd.

Residents can apply online, by mail or in person for the annual energy assistance. The agency approves applicants, then the state pays the utility company directly, Wood said. Ohio Valley Opportunities pays directly for wood if someone heats their home that way.

As of last week, there weren’t new contracts this season for the EAP program or Head Start. They’ve fundraised to help keep that open until federal funds come in.

For the EAP program, they’re operating on carryover.

“I think everybody understands that during a federal shutdown, there can be funding disruptions,” Wood said last week. “But for us right now, it is business as usual, and all of our programs are currently in full operation.”

He said Wednesday federal agencies project grants to be awarded for both programs by the end of the month.

Wood said the agency is working with utility vendors to ensure they’ve received payment, and said many companies are also honoring an extension to the state moratorium on utility shutoffs in colder months.

Under Indiana law, companies that provide electric and natural gas are prohibited from cutting customers off between Dec. 1 and March 15 if they receive EAP funds or have applied and qualify.

Wood said he believes most or all companies are counting Nov. 1 as the start this season.

Overall, the need could be bigger this season.

As of last week, Ohio Valley Opportunities had gotten around 3,000 applications. Wood said that’s lower than this time last year, but they’re already seeing a lot of new clients, and he expects that to go up.

And new financial pressures this year, like the delay in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, could cause people to hold off on seeking help with utilities until food needs are met. Wood said, in talking with other service providers, it’s clear that more people are accessing food pantries.

“I think that once people figure out where their meals [are] coming from, the next is heat,” he said.

National and state concerns

The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority reports that in fiscal year 2024, more than 120,000 households received energy assistance.

Nationwide, around 6 million households benefit from the national Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which costs around $4 billion per year. That’s according to Cassandra Lovejoy, policy and managing director at the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, or NEADA, an organization that represents the state implementers of the LIHEAP program.

She said last week they’re “very concerned” about the status of LIHEAP funding. In a normal year they would have already received funding and be providing benefits to households around the country “and that is not happening in most states right now.”

Lovejoy said the assistance only accounts for around 20% of eligible households — in some cases because people don’t know about the program or choose not to apply, or due to lack of funding.

“If we wanted to fully fund the program, we’d have to double the appropriation,” she said.

She also said the need for utility assistance can point to larger financial issues.

“If you're struggling with that bill, chances are that you're struggling with most of your other bills as well,” she said.

Danielle Drew, housing stability manager at Prosperity Indiana, said in an email that even though there is a moratorium preventing utility shutoffs in colder months, that money is still due. Families can fall behind, which can mean they face high utility costs and shutoffs after March 15.

Lovejoy expects the need for energy assistance to increase — due to inflation, rising grocery prices, delayed SNAP benefits and rising energy costs.

Information from NEADA shows that the average electric bill in Indiana rose 25% from July 2024 compared with July 2025 — the second largest increase in the country, behind Illinois. That means Hoosiers paid on average $42 more a year later.

In October, NEADA executive director Mark Wolfe called on utility companies across the United States to “maintain continuous service for all customers until federal LIHEAP funds are released and households regain access to vital financial assistance.”

CenterPoint Energy and Duke Energy, two companies that serve Southern Indiana, told LPM News they have existing programs to help customers.

At CenterPoint, that includes a partnership with the Salvation Army and balanced billing, which averages a customer’s annual payments divided by 12, so they pay the same amount every month.

Duke Energy’s offerings include interest-free payments and the company’s Share the Light Fund, which can provide up to $300 in payment help.

How to apply

Applications for Indiana’s Energy Assistance Program opened on Oct. 1 and close at 5 p.m. April 20. Residents can apply online via the state portal. Southern Indiana residents can also get information about mail or in-person applications by contacting Ohio Valley Opportunities.

To aid the process of state aid approval and allow countries to support companies in international competition in their efforts to move away from fossil fuels, the European Commission in June introduced specific conditions. Among these are guardrails for support for electricity costs for energy-intensive users, for example limiting it to at most half of a company's annual electricity consumption. It also prescribes that companies must invest at least 50 percent of the aid in new clean assets, such as renewable energy generation capacity or energy efficiency improvements.

Lawmakers say government rules may be making cars increasingly unaffordable for ordinary Americans

Automakers expected to argue that EV mandates, material prices and regulatory burdens are driving the price surge

The CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — along with a senior Tesla executive — have been asked to appear before Congress early next year to explain why the price of a new vehicle has surged to record highs. The Senate Commerce Committee scheduled the hearing for January 14, 2026, marking the most significant public showdown between lawmakers and auto industry leaders since the 2008 bailout era.

At the center of the inquiry is a straightforward but politically loaded question: Why are U.S. consumers paying so much more for a car today than they were just a decade ago? According to Senate staff, the average price of a new vehicle has more than doubled during that period, putting even entry-level models out of reach for many families. Committee Chair Ted Cruz (R-TX) says federal policies — especially emissions rules and electric-vehicle (EV) mandates — may be “making cars expensive and out of reach for American customers.”

Whether new-car prices actually doubled is debatable. Statistics from Kelley Blue Book show that average new-car prices increased significantly from about $34,428 in late 2015 to about $50,080 in 2025, not double but dramatic nonetheless. The price surge was most dramatic in the early 2020s, driven by supply chain issues.

Congress questions regulatory role in rising costs

Lawmakers plan to press the automakers on how government rules factor into sticker prices. They argue that complying with tougher emissions standards, meeting EV-transition requirements, and redesigning factories around battery-driven platforms all carry enormous costs. And while some of those costs reflect long-term climate goals, senators want to know how much of the immediate price burden is being shifted to consumers.

Automakers, for their part, have long maintained that the transition to EVs is capital-intensive, requiring new facilities, new supply chains and new materials — particularly for battery production. Lithium, nickel, graphite and other elements underpinning the EV transition have all seen volatile pricing. Industry executives are widely expected to argue that these pressures, combined with residual inflation, higher labor costs from recent union agreements, and global supply-chain instability, are driving up the cost of producing every new vehicle.

Tesla’s presence — represented by its vice president of vehicle engineering — underscores how even the most established EV manufacturer is entangled in this debate. While Tesla does not face the same legacy liabilities as the Detroit Three, it does face similar challenges in sourcing materials and scaling production.

Consumer impact at the center of the debate

For millions of Americans, the affordability crisis is not just theoretical. The price of a new vehicle now routinely surpasses $46,000, according to industry data, and monthly payments have climbed sharply due to high interest rates. Many buyers who previously relied on inexpensive sedans have found themselves funneled into SUVs or crossovers, as manufacturers have largely abandoned low-margin compact models.

The result is a consumer ecosystem where even middle-income households face limited choices. Some have shifted to the used-car market, where prices ballooned during the pandemic and have yet to fully settle. Others have delayed purchases indefinitely, creating what dealers describe as “pent-up demand” that could destabilize prices even further if economic conditions shift.

Consumer advocates warn that if Congress responds by rolling back certain regulations, the changes could have unintended consequences — weakening emissions goals or reducing incentives for automakers to preserve safety features and crashworthiness. Industry watchers also note that cost pressures may cause companies to streamline vehicle trims or de-content certain models, which could affect both safety and reliability down the line.

What happens next

Committee staff expect written testimony from all four automakers to be submitted before the January session. The hearing could prompt new legislation aimed at easing regulatory burdens, adjusting EV-transition timelines, or imposing new oversight on automaker pricing and dealer markups. If any of the executives decline to appear, subpoenas remain an option — a rarity but not unheard of for high-profile automotive inquiries.

The outcome may shape key policy debates heading into 2026, particularly as automakers balance regulatory compliance, electrification goals, and consumer affordability — a triangle of competing demands with no easy solution.

How to protect yourself when shopping during a price surge

Run a full cost-of-ownership comparison. Don’t just compare sticker prices — include fuel or charging costs, maintenance, insurance, and expected resale value.

Look for incentive stacking. EV tax credits, dealer cash, regional rebates and federal incentives can meaningfully reduce upfront costs.

Shop across regions. Prices can vary dramatically by state. High-demand areas often carry higher markups. Be sure to check sales taxes as well.

Avoid dealer add-ons you don’t need. Extended warranties, paint protection and “market adjustment” fees can add thousands.

Be flexible on drivetrain. Hybrid models may offer a better cost-to-value ratio for some buyers than fully electric or fully gas-powered vehicles.

Order rather than buy off the lot. Factory orders may avoid local markups and provide more control over options.

Check for recalls before you buy. Especially in a cost-pressured environment, ensure that safety issues aren’t being overlooked.

What to do if you’re priced out of the new-car market

Consider certified pre-owned (CPO). These offer manufacturer-backed warranties and inspections at far below the cost of new models.

Seek out last-year’s model. Dealers often discount previous-year inventory once redesigns arrive.

Downsize strategically. A smaller vehicle — or a simpler trim — can save thousands with minimal compromise. The top trim level is almost never a good deal.

Use credit unions for financing. They often offer significantly lower interest rates than dealer-arranged loans.

Delay if you can. Market volatility means prices may ease after regulatory hearings or model-year transitions.

Document any deceptive pricing. If you encounter misleading fees or bait-and-switch tactics, file a complaint with your state attorney general or the FTC.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/expensive-car-midj-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:01:56.677039

“With two kids, I no longer have the time to DIY maintain a high-strung turbo gas car like I used to.
I went with EVs primarily because they are fast, fun, and don't attract attention like a fast gas car would.""","“Today we saw a grizzly,"" says Ingrid Ritchey. “And I pulled over next to another photographer taking pictures. I rolled down the window and he whispered to me. ‘Bears are right there, 40 yards.’ If it had been a gas car making a lot of noise, he would not have been able to whisper.""

Ingrid Ritchey didn't expect to sneak up on grizzly bears when she was considering an electric vehicle. Retired in West Yellowstone, MT, Ritchey is an avid hiker and amateur photographer, touring Yellowstone National Park in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E.

The gas engine of her previous Honda CR-V would scare away wildlife so she could only catch glimpses. An electric vehicle lets her blend into the surroundings.

“It is so quiet, so silent, that it won't scare the bears or elk,” she says. “We are very conscious of noise, so an EV fits.”

This is just one of the surprises drivers discover when they switch their primary vehicle from gas to electric, CarMax reports.

Road Trippin’ Realities

One of the common myths of EV ownership is that electric cars aren't suitable for road trips. The truth is it depends entirely on the driver and the EV selected for the task.

“My longest trip was from Las Vegas, NV to here (West Yellowstone),"" says Ritchey. Google showed it to be a 10-hour and 30-minute drive of over 730 miles.

“The first day of driving, I had two stops,"" she says. “And it took only 30 minutes to charge. They [charging stations] are usually in a good gas station or Walmart parking lot. You stop, go to the restroom, grab a sandwich or an ice cream, and stretch your legs. Grab a cup of coffee, and then you're ready—jump in the car and go. It's really easy.""

Ritchey had made this trip in a gas vehicle before and had to stop overnight at the halfway point. This tradition continues with her EV, but instead of searching for a nearby gas station, she charges while sleeping and wakes up to a full charge. That's road trip convenience.

Erin Harty, a journalist based out of Baltimore, MD has similar thoughts about road trips. She's averaging 750 miles per week in her 2023 Chevrolet Bolt, which is incredible since she doesn't have access to home or workplace charging. She relies exclusively on the public charging network. She visits Chicago a few times per year and prefers to drive so her dogs can easily travel with her. It's a trip she often made in her Chevrolet Tahoe.

“Low gas mileage has always given me a lot of environmental guilt,"" says Harty. “Especially now that I'm driving so much. And of course, it costs a fortune [to fill up].""

Harty needed a vehicle that could haul cargo and tow, so after buying the Bolt EV, she kept her Tahoe as a secondary vehicle.

“It's about 700 miles to Chicago, and normally I try to keep moving and only stop long enough to get gas and use a restroom, maybe grab some coffee.""

Harty says if the weather cooperates, she can slog through the drive in approximately 11 hours, only stopping for gas once or twice.

“But I'm pretty wrecked once I get to where I'm going,"" Harty continues. “Driving that much without a real break just takes a lot out of you.""

She recently made the trip to Chicago in her Bolt EV. “It's just a whole different mentality. Although I did do it in one day heading out—and that was a long day—I think it took me about 16 hours door to door—it was much more relaxing, and I didn't feel awful when I arrived in Chicago.""

A common theme among EV drivers is how the slightly more frequent stops to charge improve the road trip experience. It gives the driver moments to rest, rather than the drive becoming a grueling all-day task where you're stuck behind the wheel. EV owners report arriving feeling physically and mentally fresh, even if they have to add hours to the trip.

“I'd say that being forced to stop every two and a half hours to charge for 40 minutes was actually really nice,"" says Jason P., an automotive assembly worker for a major manufacturer in Detroit, MI.

His 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E did a 1,200-mile round trip to Minneapolis last month, an event he describes as “delightful"" thanks to the calm manner of the EV.

“There's that toxic masculinity mentality, where you feel you have to ‘go until you hit empty!’ and being forced to reconcile with the fatigue I was not previously acknowledging in past cars was really refreshing. Plus, the chargers are almost always near a gas station or grocery store so ... snacks!""

Recharging the Whole Family

Despite a constantly expanding EV charging network, plugging in away from home can sometimes be tricky. Choosing when to stop as a lone driver is one thing but balancing the needs of your whole crew? That takes extra consideration.

“When we travel with two little kids, our stops are more frequent, roughly every two hours,"" says Andrew Donnan, a digital marketing and web development specialist in Greenville, SC.

“My worst range was in a Tesla Model Y Performance with a big cargo box on the top, multiple bikes on the rear, and 18-inch all-terrain tires. We got maybe 130 miles of range, but there are plenty of Tesla chargers out there, so it wasn't a concern."" With Tesla's quick charging, the kids didn't have time to get bored.

Realizing this wouldn't be the last road trip with children, Donnan swapped the compact Model Y for a full-size Rivian R1S, so he and his wife, two kids, and a dog have plenty of space during road trips. The electric SUV is ideal for his family due to the interior space, and as a car enthusiast, he appreciates the powerful performance. Donnan has owned several high-performance BMWs over the years and feels EVs are even easier when it comes to maintenance.

“With two kids, I no longer have the time to DIY maintain a high-strung turbo gas car like I used to. I went with EVs primarily because they are fast, fun, and don't attract attention like a fast gas car would.""

His previous Model Y also earned high praise for acceleration, but less so for comfort and utility, he explains, “Tesla's Model Y does ride pretty firm, and its aerodynamic shape is not good for hauling bulky things in the trunk, like a 60 lb. dog."" He says Lucy, his rescue labradoodle mix, prefers the Rivian for road trips.

“I drove the Rivian 830 miles home in 25 hours from the Chicago area,"" says Donnan. “The trip was great!"" Donnan credits the comfortable interior and extremely quiet drive for assisting with the pleasant experience. “And I even took a three-hour nap in it [at a stop]!""

Many new EV owners know to expect the unexpected with public charging and take it in their stride. “On my drive home from Chicago,"" recalls Donnan, “one EA [Electrify America] charging stop was in the middle of a parking lot being resurfaced, but it was also 2:00 a.m. They let me charge, but I would've been in a bad spot had they started laying asphalt and prevented me from charging.""

Thoughtful Advice

EVs bring with them the quirks and unique experiences that are welcomed by early tech adopters. The owners above have some advice if you're truly considering an EV.

Location, location, location...

Donnan says while he enjoyed the pervasive Tesla Supercharger network, the locations varied greatly in terms of convenience and amenities. “Sometimes the chargers are behind a fast-food place, sometimes at a gas station, and sometimes it's just in the middle of a parking lot. You really never know where they are going to be.""

Donnan's advice is to plan ahead and make sure the charger is near a place your child will want to eat. If chicken tenders make up the majority of their diet, getting stuck at a charger with only burger restaurants nearby will be a disappointment.

Know before you go

Also, Donnan says to check out the charger status before heading out. “Rivian's Adventure Network let me down once in Blowing Rock, NC, where it was offline for all six stalls."" He blamed himself, not the vehicle or network. He hadn't checked to see if the charger was showing online, and it had been down for approximately a month.

“We were okay, range-wise, to get to a different station, but it did add an hour or so of travel time. Those [Rivian] chargers are great otherwise.""

Be ready to chat

A common comment among EV owners is being “a mascot” for EV ownership. “People are also really interested in them [EVs] and will strike up a conversation with you in a parking lot to ask you about your car!"" says Harty about her Bolt.

Jason P. agrees. “The funniest part is that at every stop during daylight hours, you find cool people who want to talk EVs with you. I wish I had known earlier that everyone and their mother was going to grill me about EV ownership,"" he jokes. ""It's a really easy-going community and most drivers I've met are extremely friendly.""

Keep an open mind

Harty says researching is good, but seat time is better. “A lot of the articles are focused on specs and are full of acronyms and numbers that don't make a lot of sense at first, but you don't have to be a “car guy"" (or girl) to drive one of these.

“I will say that although learning about EVs is kind of intimidating just because it's so different from a gas vehicle, once I actually had one and started driving it, things made a lot more sense.""

Flexibility helps

Harty can’t charge her Bolt at home but takes advantage of Baltimore's robust public charging network. She regularly charges at a local park where she walks her dogs or can “fill up"" at a restaurant while eating.

She says people in apartments or with street parking should still consider an EV. “Honestly, for most people who have a garage or a driveway and just charge their car at home, an EV is a no-brainer and is super easy. I don't think you really have to think much about the range and all that. I would just tell people that not having home or office charging doesn't have to be a deal breaker; it's totally possible to do without if you have a few options for reliable, convenient public charging,"" says Harty.

EVs Work for Most People

You might be surprised at how well an EV can fit your lifestyle; it just takes a small mindset shift to adapt to charging rather than filling up with gas. Road trippers should consider the additional time needed for a trip, but also factor in arriving refreshed instead of worn out—you'll be surprised what a difference those enforced breaks make.

Families with kids will want to take a second look at charging locations, just to make sure everyone will get something from the stop. But realistically, when charging stations can be found at rest stops, retail parks, and fast-food outlets, be prepared for an in-depth discussion about snack and lunch options.

If you're considering an EV, get out there and drive one—you may be pleasantly surprised.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/88/2886db35-4989-5d3c-b126-49291e1300e4/691f45a43a855.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:53.115522

Progressive leaders called for answers this week for the cancelation of the EV battery plant that would have transformed the former Fisher Body plant in the Milwaukee Junction neighborhood into a clean-energy manufacturing hub.

“Current policy settings and market conditions in the United States, including recent changes to critical tax credits, have created significant uncertainty around the viability of long-term investment in advanced manufacturing,” a Fortescue spokesperson said in a statement to Crain’s Detroit Business, which first reported the news.

The company announced the proposed EV plant at the Fisher Body Plant in 2023. EV chargers, batteries and hydrogen generators were planned to have been built there.

Officials Wednesday including State Sen. Stephanie Chang said the September cancelation is a huge hit to the potential progress on local employment, industrial revitalization, and air-quality improvements.

“To cancel a critical clean energy investment in Detroit is to rip away more breathable air for our children, our grandchildren and vulnerable Michiganders,” Chang said. “The Trump administration’s rollbacks on clean energy policy is indicative of the fact that they fail to understand the positive jobs, climate and health impacts for our local communities. We should not stifle innovation or clean energy progress to keep outdated energy sources alive.”

The company cited the cutting of clean energy tax credits in Republicans’ most recent budget bill, according to a report from Politico last week.

On Wednesday, November 19, local leaders came together to demand accountability for the cancellation of the Fortescue electric vehicle battery plant – and the loss of the 600 good-paying jobs and cleaner future for Detroit families that would have come with it.

Chang spoke about Detroit’s future as a clean energy leader and how EV manufacturing has been stymied by the cancellation of clean energy incentives through the Republican-led budget bill.

The cancellation is a setback for the city’s attempt to bring a green manufacturing boom. The facility, which was to be the company’s first U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Center, was expected to create 600 jobs with an average annual wage of more than $45,000.

The project was aggressively courted by state leaders who offered $12.7 million in tax incentives and $11 million in Detroit brownfield incentives.

“Detroit has always been at the forefront of vehicle innovation, and this investment was an opportunity to show what Motor City is able to do,” said Jamie Racklyeft, Executive Director, Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance (MEVA). “We can still be the hub for electric vehicle innovation if our leaders prioritize clean energy so we can make a brighter future for transportation.”",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/IMG_2663-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:02.005187

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on Wednesday ordered three FirstEnergy utilities to pay $250.7 million for the H.B. 6 corruption scandal and other rule violations.

The PUC ordered Ohio Edison Co., The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and The Toledo Edison Co. to pay $186.6 million in refunds and restitution to their customers and to pay $64.1 million in civil forfeitures.

The utilities must refund $180 million to their customers over three billing cycles — triple the $60 million FirstEnergy used in a bribery scheme involving the passage of legislation in Ohio that in part aimed to prop up financially struggling nuclear power plants, according to the decision.

“These [$60 million in] funds represent an unnerving shadow over our regulatory role in this state and have harmed each and every consumer whose interests we aim to protect in proceedings before us,” the PUC said in its decision.

“Ohioans expect and deserve fair utility bills and utility companies that follow the law,” Maureen Willis, director of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, said in a statement. “Today’s PUCO order requiring fines, restitution and refunds is an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused.”

FirstEnergy spokeswoman Lauren Siburkis said the PUC’s decision “closes a chapter tied to activities that do not represent the company we are today. FirstEnergy is committed to accountability, transparency and rebuilding trust.”

“The Ohio companies remain focused on investing in the distribution system to enhance reliability and improve the customer experience for the benefit of more than two million customers in the state,” FirstEnergy said in an investor update on Thursday.

The sanctions create a near-term cash drag for FirstEnergy, but clears a major regulatory risk, according to equity analysts with Jefferies. “We believe this was the last remaining key item to close out this chapter of the company’s history,” they said Thursday.

Separately, the PUC approved a $34 million rate increase for FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities, down from a $190 million requested rate hike. It authorized a 9.63% return on equity compared to the utilities’ request for a 10.8% ROE.

“While the precise pacing of cash payments and bill credits will determine the short-term hit to credit metrics, we see the bigger implication as the removal of tail-risk around further PUCO monetary penalties and the establishment of a more predictable, if less generous, return framework that should allow [FirstEnergy] to keep funding Ohio grid and reliability capex within its broader regulated investment strategy,” the Jefferies analysts said.

In its decision related to the H.B 6 investigations, the PUC said FirstEnergy and its Ohio utilities have made “significant changes to instill a commitment to ongoing oversight and transparency, including the creation of the Office of Ethics and Compliance to institute and promote an appropriate culture and the implementation of several overarching policies to govern the relationships and interactions between FirstEnergy Corp. and its affiliates with those operating within the political and public spheres.”

FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, has already agreed to pay $390 million in other federal and state penalties related to the corruption scandal.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd7%2F41%2Fb41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217%2Fmain-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:33.956543

A sprawling area of Richland Parish, once known for quiet fields, is now undergoing massive change after Meta broke ground on its $10 billion “Hyperion” data center.
This follows industry norms: “even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people,” leaving states with enormous costs per permanent job created.
Power demands from data centers are staggering.
More than half the energy powering U.S. data centers comes from fossil fuels, a footprint already resulting in “over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year.” With new power plants being built specifically to serve future data centers, emissions are expected to soar.","Farmland in rural North Louisiana is rapidly transforming into one of the nation’s newest data center battlegrounds. A sprawling area of Richland Parish, once known for quiet fields, is now undergoing massive change after Meta broke ground on its $10 billion “Hyperion” data center. The influence has been immediate and dramatic. In a parish of just over 20,000 residents, “5,000 out-of-state construction workers are projected to be working here at the project’s peak.” The promise of jobs and new economic activity is enticing local leaders—yet policy experts warn states to tread carefully.

Meta didn’t choose Louisiana because of its culture, climate, or cuisine. As the author explains, “Louisiana gave Meta what it wanted in tax breaks.” In just weeks, state lawmakers altered a bill originally designed to support rural broadband rebates and instead tailored it to subsidize data center construction. The pivot was so abrupt that no financial impact assessment was produced. “No one knows how much this will cost the state,” the report notes, adding that neither residents nor legislators will learn the real amount of lost public revenue until Meta files for its sales tax rebates in future years.

Louisiana’s situation reflects a national trend. Governments across the country are racing to lure data centers from tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, often deploying massive subsidy packages without fully assessing long-term effects. According to a report cited in the article, “at least 10 states are already losing more than $100 million each in revenue a year from these tax breaks”—money that could otherwise support schools, infrastructure, and public services. The boom is fueled by AI technology, which requires exponentially more computing power. In fact, Texas “saw its annual cost estimates grow from $130 million to over $1 billion in the span of 23 months.”

Yet despite the public spending, data centers create strikingly few full-time jobs. Most positions are temporary construction roles. As the piece notes, “Meta, instead, is only required to create 500 full-time jobs by 2035 to receive the maximum amount of tax breaks.” Even as one of the world’s largest data centers, Hyperion’s workforce needs will remain modest. This follows industry norms: “even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people,” leaving states with enormous costs per permanent job created.

The public risks extend beyond tax revenue. Power demands from data centers are staggering. States often lack existing energy infrastructure and are forced to expand capacity for the sole benefit of a single corporation. In Louisiana, “Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants just for Meta’s data center, which is projected to use more than three times the electricity of New Orleans on any given day.” Consumers, not tech giants, shoulder these utility costs. The report warns that residents elsewhere have faced electricity bill increases that “double and even triple over the last five years” in areas hosting large data centers. For regions like Richland Parish, “where 25 percent of people live below the poverty line,” such hikes could further push vulnerable households into hardship.

Environmental consequences are compounding concerns. More than half the energy powering U.S. data centers comes from fossil fuels, a footprint already resulting in “over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year.” With new power plants being built specifically to serve future data centers, emissions are expected to soar. Water challenges are also growing, as these facilities require enormous volumes to cool servers, in some cases using “as much water as a small town.” These demands threaten water quality and availability for surrounding communities.

With billions flowing to some of the world’s richest corporations, policy experts argue that states must reconsider their approach. The author concludes that governments should halt subsidies and rethink priorities: “States need to put their own residents first to ensure that they’re protected from negative externalities of the data center industry.” Otherwise, they warn, states could ignite “a race to the bottom, draining revenues and pocketbooks.”

Data centers are undeniably crucial infrastructure for AI, cloud services, and modern computing, but policymakers face a complex trade-off. Subsidies meant to spur economic development may accelerate corporate growth while leaving taxpayers with infrastructure burdens, long-term expenses, and limited job opportunities. Experts suggest future incentives should be tied to local hiring, energy efficiency requirements, and transparent reporting to ensure benefits outweigh costs.",,N,,2025-11-20 14:04:38.548058

On 13 November 2025, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) passed an amendment to, inter alia, the Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz – “EnWG”) and the Federal Building Code (Baugesetzbuch – “BauGB”) which significantly simplifies the development of energy storage projects. The reform is intended to accelerate the expansion of storage facilities and thus create a central prerequisite for the energy transition. The following aspects are key from a developer and investor perspective.

What do I need to know?

Privileged permitting

The reform elevates legal certainty regarding the privileged treatment of thermal storage facilities, hydrogen storage facilities, and large-scale battery storage systems in outer areas (Außenbereich). By introducing no. 10 and 11 into section 35 BauGB, such projects are now expressly granted privileged status in the outer area.

From a permitting perspective this constitutes a major simplification of future permit procedures for such storage facilities. The legislator thereby addresses the practical reality that the implementation of such projects was previously subject to considerable legal uncertainty, resulting in significant delays in the permitting procedure. The explicit regulation ensures that the permissibility under planning law can now be determined promptly.

The amendment to the BauGB is complemented by an addition to section 11c EnWG. This provision clarifies that until the power supply in Germany is practically greenhouse gas neutral the accelerated expansion of energy storage facilities shall be regarded as a priority concern in the respective balancing of protected interests. This amendment constitutes an essential element in assessing the permissibility of storage facilities under the new concept of Section 35 BauGB and ensuring the effectiveness of the legislative reform.

Exemption from grid usage fee also for multi-use storage systems

The amendment act introduces one aspect in the context of this exemption which can be expected to facilitate the economic operation of so-called multi-use storage systems (e.g. BESS used as a buffer for a PV plant and for peak-shaving purposes): whilst the exemption so far applied to storage facilities if they use power from the grid (i.e. excluding multi-use systems), it will in the future apply also to multi-use systems to the extent they use power from the grid (section 118 para. 6 sentence 2 EnWG).

The current reform does not include an extension of the exemption for energy storage from the duty to pay grid usage fees which has been called for by industry players. The 20-year exemption therefore remains limited to energy storage projects commissioned by 4 August 2029 at this stage.

What should I do next?

The completion of the legislative process should be followed-up. Before the new rules become law, the Second Chamber of Parliament (Bundesrat) will decide on 21 November 2025 whether to raise an objection. Such an objection would not cause the Act to fail directly but it would prompt the Bundestag to reconsider the Act.

In addition to the changes through the current EnWG reform, stakeholders should follow-up on a potential legislative proposal by Federal Government on the power grid connection procedures, which Parliament asked Federal Government to present in the first quarter of 2026: such proposal should, in the Parliament’s view, fundamentally improve and digitise the grid connection procedure in the electricity grid for generation plants, consumers and storage facilities in order to increase transparency and planning security, to resolve the backlog of connection requests, particularly from large battery storage facilities, industrial customers and data centres, and to enable grid operators to deal with the acute situation of increasingly scarce grid connection capacities in a way that makes sense from an overall economic perspective.",,N,,2025-11-20 15:01:05.350004

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a broad package of federal spending and tax policies signed into law in July 2025, spells trouble for the residential solar industry. The law ends a large subsidy for residential consumers at year-end 2025.

It will also alter the broad distribution of tax benefits and the geographic dispersal of solar resources, though these changes will appear over time. While residential solar is very visible to the public, utility-scale solar dominates the overall market.

Tax subsidies supported solar expansion

Solar power’s expansion across much of the world coincided with government subsidies. Tax credits were the favored method of supporting solar energy in the U.S. Generally, an individual or business investing in solar energy could receive a tax credit equal to some percentage of the outlay.

The provision covered both residential installations and industrial development. After installing solar panels, residential consumers could claim a residential solar tax credit when they filed their taxes.

The residential solar tax credit is not new, and debate about the subsidy’s existence and its form have persisted since a Carter administration-backed measure created the first tax credit for solar system installation in 1978. The provision expired in 1985 under the Reagan administration and returned when President George W. Bush signed The Energy Policy Act into law nearly 20 years later, re-establishing the residential tax credit for solar energy.

It has endured in some form ever since, with extensions and marginal changes over the years. Under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, the residential credit for solar energy investment increased to 30 percent of qualified investment costs, up from 26 percent. The provision was to begin phasing out after 2032.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed within the first six months of the second Trump administration, removed tax credit eligibility for any system placed in service after Dec. 31. It will also mark the end of two decades during which a tax credit has been in place.

Residential solar credit often excludes low-income households

Although available to all households, solar tax credits don’t get much take-up among low-income households. The average cost of a household solar system is a little over $29,000. Assuming the installation fully qualifies for the 30 percent tax credit in 2025, the net-cost of the solar system would be roughly $20,000 ($29,000 sticker price minus the $8,700 credit).

Low-income households do not commonly have $29,000 in available cash (apart from the tax credit) for the up-front cost of installation. Even if they did, these households are more likely to rent rather than own their housing, which means they often do not have the option to install solar panels even if they had the money (Chart 1).

Thus, high income earners receive most of the benefit from the residential clean energy credit (Chart 2). Just under 1.25 million tax returns had residential energy credit attached in the 2023 tax year. The credit claimed that year totaled $6.3 billion.

About two-thirds of all credited dollars went to those reporting more than $100,000 in annual income. This group represents only around 24 percent of tax filers.

The form of the tax credit is another limiting factor for low-income households that might opt for a solar system. The credit is not fully refundable—that is, it cannot exceed the taxpayer’s annual tax liability.

The $8,700 solar tax credit in this example would exceed the annual tax bill for many low-income households. To obtain a credit, such a taxpayer would need to either spread the credit over several years or install a smaller system, lowering the present value of a full solar tax credit relative to an upper-income household that could take the entire credit at once.

Energy consumption skews toward high-incomes households

The distribution of energy consumption by income level often isn’t included in the analysis of who benefits from the residential energy tax credit.

While distribution of benefits from residential energy tax credits favors upper-income households, those groups also consume more energy than their low-income counterparts (Chart 3).

Insofar that reduced grid demand is a beneficial byproduct of residential solar systems, a policy whose distribution skews toward upper-income households might reduce grid stress more relative to a flat subsidy. However, solar panels also induce demand for energy consumption.

Solar panels, by subsidizing a household’s variable energy costs, incentivize those same households to consume more. This might come in the form of purchasing an electric vehicle or through other household electrification, such as switching to electric cook tops and heating or purchasing additional appliances. There is reason to believe that although residential solar has net-reduction effects on grid consumption, residential solar does not one-for-one displace grid consumption.

The raw distribution of residential tax credit masks its complicated effects. While high-income households disproportionately benefit from residential tax credits, they also disproportionately contribute to grid demand.

Residential consumption makes up small overall share

Even though residential solar installations might be the most visible form of solar energy, these systems contribute a small (and shrinking) fraction of solar investment.

The residential segment accounted for just more than 20 percent of solar installations in 2015. The share shrank to just over 17 percent in 2024. The decline reflects, in part, maturation and economies of scale for the solar industry, which has made utility-scale developments more competitive.

For example, a typical home solar system might have an 8 kilowatt to 12 kilowatt capacity, while a typical utility-scale solar farm of 150 megawatts is more than 10,000 times larger and is assembled at a steep per-unit discount on construction cost.

Residential solar also is not always the most economically efficient use of the marginal solar resource, since many areas in the country, such as Washington state, do not receive nearly the level of sun that Texas and Arizona do. The residential solar tax credit, by offering the same cost-based subsidy independent of geography, caused deployment of solar resources in suboptimal solar resource areas (Chart 4).

For instance, when a Seattle homeowner reviews the cost and benefit of a solar system, the subsidy significantly affects the break-even calculation. In a less subsidized environment, solar panels need to produce much more sunlight or utility savings to make sense for residential consumers. That is not always possible for someone living in a low-sunlight area such as Seattle.

Fewer home panels doesn’t mean less solar

While a full repeal of the residential energy tax credit likely leads to a decrease in residential installations, the growth of utility-scale projects will at least partially offset the impact, particularly with the future siting of marginal panels more likely in higher sunlight areas.

This moment of change in the solar industry will likely more progressively distribute benefits under the remaining tax credit system, all else equal. The residential share of development will shrink because of One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions.

However, utility-scale developers will have an easier time surviving the act’s impacts because of better project economics and a more favorable subsidy expiration schedule that in some cases runs until 2027.

Finally, the marginal solar resource will likely concentrate further toward areas of the country with greater sunlight. The lack of a broad subsidy will cause remaining developers and customers to tilt further toward the most solar-rich areas to get the most out of their panels.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/research/economics/2025/1120/neighborhood-solar-panels-pri.png,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:29.272463

Beyond equipment, Baker Hughes has also committed strategic capital, becoming an investor in the project — a move that signals confidence from one of the most established technology players in the global gas market.

The agreement was formalized during a high-level event in Washington, D.C., attended by federal officials including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Both emphasized the role of Alaska LNG in U.S. energy resilience and global energy strategy, positioning it as a project of both economic and geopolitical significance.

By integrating proven LNG technologies rather than introducing untested systems, Glenfarne reduces technical risk and advances toward final investment decision (FID) with a stronger platform. The company has already made notable progress since taking the lead in March, including early commercial traction with buyers across Asia — an area where shipping advantages could give Alaska a competitive edge over Gulf Coast terminals.

Two-Phase Strategy Sets Clear Path to Market

Glenfarne is pursuing a phased construction plan designed to move faster than previous attempts at development. In Phase One, an 807-mile, 42-inch natural gas pipeline would link Alaska’s North Slope resources to in-state users and the eventual LNG terminal. Final engineering and cost analysis from Worley are expected by December, with FID anticipated soon after.

Phase Two adds a full-scale liquefaction and export facility capable of shipping up to 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG to international markets. That component is targeting a late-2026 FID. Glenfarne has already secured preliminary commitments from buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, which collectively represent over 60% of the volume needed to greenlight the project.

The structure aligns with evolving market realities, enabling capital deployment in stages and increasing project bankability. It also reflects Glenfarne’s broader LNG footprint across North America — including permitted sites in Louisiana and Texas — giving the company a diversified platform to serve global demand from multiple basins.",https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/environment/original/20251114-090753-acd-getty-images-xQLb4F23jdM-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:03:53.561880

CleanTechnica is all for renewables and electrification.

We exist to remind humans of the Earth and to rid it of smoke belchers, offensive energy generation, and climate deniers. Idealistic as we are, we are also grounded in the truth that this will never happen quickly enough, and will happen mostly out of necessity.

And if you read the stories here, we question, oftentimes lambast, sometimes expose, but mostly praise and give credit where credit is due. I just have to say this to set the tone for this piece.

When I received the latest unaudited reports from VinFast last September, I asked them if I could get an audited report before I started writing my opinion on VinFast and where it is going—at least in the market where it intended to grow the fastest and the biggest—right here in the USA. Elsewhere in the world, they are seeping (that’s the word) into the market. Intentionally slow, I guess. But never overly cautious.

The reports never arrived, but that won’t stop a story. And it seems nothing will stop VinFast’s push into the US, a push recently highlighted by its aggressive presence at major events like the Electrify Expo, a vital step in re-establishing the brand after some missteps, which includes bad press on the VF8.

Now, I found two reasons to write this piece: 1) the residual value program the company is running in the Philippines and Indonesia; 2) and even more profoundly, space exploration.

Yes, VinGroup is now looking at the heavens for expansion, investing in a new company called VinSpace Joint Stock Company. According to Reuters, who broke the story, the new VND300 billion ($11,840,000) venture will be involved in space-related activities, specifically telecommunication satellite operations and scientific research.

Doesn’t that sound like burning cash?

Recently, CleanTechnica revisited their plant in Vietnam for the third time and compared notes between 2022 and 2025. There is great progress in manufacturing, research, and development back in Vietnam. This wasn’t just progress; it was transformative, at the very least.

Not financial advice

I am not a finance guy, so this story was developed with a lot of help from an auditor friend (whose name I cannot mention) to make me understand what the rows and columns of numbers imply. The numbers themselves were staggering, but two distinct impressions came to mind to me as a non-finance guy.

First, my thought is: this company is crazy. This level of financial risk is matched only by their history of audacity. I have covered the brand since 2017 when they held a contest to present to the Vietnamese people designs for the new national car, which was later to become the Lux A2.0 and Lux SA 2.0.

Imagine that. Instead of just getting a few heads together in the design phase, they elicited the help of the whole nation, with 60,000 citizens casting votes.

I realized that over time, the company was losing money at such a breathtaking pace that any other car company would have executives exiting or scrambling for solutions. VinFast executives seem to be sleeping just fine.

I asked a finance expert friend and journalist to tell me what the Vietnamese automaker’s latest unaudited financial report means. He said if we look at it historically, it is simply good investing. He pointed out how Tesla suffered losses too, both capital and operational. He framed the reports as a masterclass in strategic spending: take enormous losses now to dominate the global EV market later.

Wild, Wild East

The current numbers tell a wild story. (Note: not audited, not updated since September 10, 2025.)

VinFast delivered 72,167 EVs in the first half of 2025—a staggering 223% jump from the same period last year. Add in their e-scooters and e-bikes, and they’re moving serious volume: 114,484 two-wheelers delivered, up 447% year-over-year. Revenue hit $663 million in the second quarter alone, nearly doubling from last year. With 394 showrooms now spread across the globe, it’s the kind of operational breakthrough that should have investors celebrating.

The most recent press release said “VinFast continues to break records in the domestic automotive market by successfully delivering 20,380 electric cars of various models in October 2025, bringing the total number of VinFast vehicles delivered nationwide to 124,264 units in the first 10 months of the year.”

Those figures are real.

Crucially, many of those cars are “sales” to a related entity: the GSM taxi service—an enormously successful endeavor in the countries it has located in. While the money moves from one corporate pocket to another, it represents significant volume and real-world testing that boosts the delivery figures.

Instead, the bottom line looks like a financial disaster zone. But it that true?

Everything or nothing

But here’s the thing—this is pure Pham Nhat Vuong.

The billionaire chairman has made it crystal clear he’s willing to lose whatever it takes to make VinFast succeed. You don’t hear that from the overly cautious American car executive scared of the stock backlash of such an announcement.

Mother company VinGroup decides fast. And good son VinFast carries out the orders quickly. I was sitting in their Hanoi offices in 2022 when the memo went out: no more internal combustion engines. Period. While Tesla was the only major new-world automaker brave enough—or insane enough (like Nissan)—to bet everything on electric, here was a Vietnamese startup that had barely figured out conventional cars making the same all-or-nothing wager.

With Vuong on record saying he’ll burn through more money if necessary, those staggering quarterly losses start looking less like financial mismanagement and more like a deliberate war chest being deployed. Every dollar of loss is deliberate, part of a $2 billion gamble that most Americans will eventually buy cars from a brand they can’t pronounce. The company is torching cash on three massive fronts: building a network of shiny showrooms from California to Germany, launching marketing blitzes to convince skeptical buyers that “Vietnamese luxury EV” isn’t an oxymoron, and funding R&D labs working around the clock on next-generation vehicles.

“Live long and prosper”

The intentions behind VinSpace are probably the “highest” possible form of ambition. With Mr. Spock’s Vulcan salute, “live long and prosper.”

Down on Earth, its sprawling Hai Phong facility continues to churn out cars, while its American manufacturing intentions rising on a North Carolina farmland are temporarily on hold. This facility isn’t just a factory—it’s VinFast’s entire American dream materialized in steel and concrete. If it works, the company dodges crushing import tariffs and slashes shipping costs while planting a flag in the world’s most competitive car market.

It is here that the delays—seen as one of those much-lambasted missteps—took on a cosmic, almost divine meaning.

When Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina in late 2024, the state’s infrastructure and construction environment ground to a halt. The VinFast site, though physically protected from the worst of the floods, was months away from significant vertical construction. Some internal observers must have quietly considered the delay an unexpected form of “divine providence,” sparing a multi-billion-dollar build from potential catastrophic disruption. If it doesn’t work, well, that’s a massive failure.

The brutal math is simple: VinFast is paying the astronomical (no pun intended) price of admission to play with Tesla, GM, and Ford. The company’s bet is that today’s financial bloodbath will look like pocket change once they’re manufacturing hundreds of thousands of EVs annually — whether that’s in Vietnam, Indonesia, India, or on good ol’ American soil.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VinFastEntrance-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:06:32.943048

At least 10 communities have been approached by data center developers, while utilities are quietly negotiating deals

Here’s how the industry might impact the environment, state revenues and power rates

Michigan is diving headlong into the national debate about hyperscale data centers as tech companies race to ink deals for land with ready access to electricity.

Developers are publicly pursuing projects in at least 10 Michigan communities — all in the Lower Peninsula — while others are in confidential negotiations to buy power from the state’s major electricity utilities.

The data center industry is expected to nearly triple by 2030, fueled by the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Tech companies are racing to build facilities as soon as possible, often facing stiff resistance from local communities and worries about environmental impact.

“The scale of it is the biggest growth in electricity demand that we’ve seen since the 1970s, and maybe even faster than that,” said Douglas Jester, managing partner at the energy consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy. “It’s a big shock to how the power system and power system regulation works.”

So far, Michigan has none of the massive hyperscale data centers owned by the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. The state has 57 smaller data centers, according to the online database Data Center Map.

Michigan OKs landmark regulations that push up-front costs to data centers

But that could soon change. Oracle, OpenAI and Related Digital have cleared key land use hurdles needed to build a $7 billion data center campus in Saline Township, south of Ann Arbor. They expect to open the facility in 2027.

Here’s what to know as the industry makes inroads in Michigan:

What is a data center?

A data center is a building or buildings housing computer servers used to store, process or distribute vast quantities of data.

They can range in size, but much of the controversy surrounding data centers is focused on the massive so-called “hyperscale” facilities that tend to occupy hundreds of acres and gobble as much electricity as a large American city to fulfill the computing needs of giant tech firms like Google, Microsoft and Oracle.

The windowless, low-slung buildings resemble Amazon fulfillment centers from the outside. But inside, hundreds of thousands of computer servers operate around the clock, providing cloud storage of photos, videos and websites or training artificial intelligence models to write term papers and perform other computing tasks.

Why is Michigan suddenly seeing so much interest in building them?

Two words: Tax breaks.

Looking to tap into a global boom, Michigan lawmakers last year passed a law exempting large centers from the state’s 6% sales and use tax. To qualify, each data center operator must invest at least $250 million and create 30 jobs paying 150% of the local median wage.

The bill received bipartisan support and opposition, with advocates lauding the breaks as an economic development tool while skeptics decried them as “corporate welfare” projects that could hurt the environment.

The subsidies have functioned as intended, attracting a wave of interest from data center developers looking to do business in Michigan. At least 35 other states have or are considering similar incentives, according to one report.

“We only locate in states that recognize data centers as the modern-day equivalent or the successor to the manufacturing and agricultural and mining industries, which have always joined full sales tax exemptions on all the stuff they buy,” said Steve DelBianco, president and CEO of the tech industry group NetChoice.

Beyond tax breaks and friendly politics, developers look to do business in places with cheap, accessible land, water and electricity.

DelBianco said demand is so great that developers need to build a new hyperscale facility every week, but critics worry that artificial intelligence companies are overvalued and communities could get stuck with data centers that aren’t needed.

How many are planned and where?

Bridge Michigan has identified at least 10 communities in which developers have publicly unveiled hyperscale data center proposals in various stages of development.

It’s likely an incomplete tally — proposals often become public only after developers approach local officials seeking zoning changes or other needed approvals. That can be months after they have quietly secured land and electricity access.

It’s also unlikely every proposal will be built. For example, a plan in Monroe County’s Dundee Township is uncertain after public outcry prompted township officials to enact a moratorium on data center development. Another in Kalkaska County would rely on public land that state officials have said they have no desire to sell. A proposal in Kalamazoo County is also on hold after public pushback.

Still, the state’s major utilities anticipate multiple data centers coming online in Michigan in the coming years, in keeping with a nationwide trend.

Consumers officials are forecasting 2.65 gigawatts in new demand in the utility’s territory, while DTE officials are in late-stage negotiations for 3 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity on top of the Saline Township proposal.

For perspective, the entire state of Michigan’s peak electrical demand is about 18 gigawatts. If all of that comes to fruition, Michigan’s peak energy demand could surge 39%.

Bridge Michigan polled the state’s other five investor-owned utilities on their projected data center power demand and none disclosed any pending deals.

How will they be powered?

If all that demand materializes, Michigan’s utilities would need to build more power plants or renewable energy arrays to keep up.

The Saline Township facility alone will demand 1.4 gigawatts, an amount equivalent to more than a million homes that will increase DTE’s system-wide demand by 25%.

DTE has said it can absorb that spike by ramping up production at existing power plants, plus buying power on the open market and building battery storage facilities that can be recharged during off-peak hours.

But long-term, both DTE and Consumers officials have said they’ll likely build new fossil fuel plants as they absorb new demand. The utilities insist they can do so while meeting Michigan’s 2040 deadline to achieve 100% clean energy, but have not provided specifics.

Spokespeople for both utilities said they will reveal further details next year, when they file what’s known as integrated resource plans with the Michigan Public Service Commission.

“We look forward to working with stakeholders and the Commission to chart the best path forward for our customers and the state,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

DelBianco, of NetChoice, said data center developers have a “preference” for clean energy but “speed to market is absolutely key.” Because wind and solar arrays are slower to build out, developers are turning to fossil fuels for now.

Michigan’s data center tax break law requires the facilities to get 90% of their electricity from clean energy within six years after being built. Environmentalists say they’ll be closely reviewing data center electricity contracts to make sure they comply.

Will they use lots of water?

Depending on the technology used to cool servers, data centers can consume vast quantities of water or relatively little.

Most data centers use evaporative cooling, a water-intensive process by which water vapor is used to cool equipment. That’s the plan for some of the proposed data centers in Michigan. In Augusta Township, for instance, the plan is to draw more than 1 million gallons daily from the local water utility. Local water officials say the system has plenty of excess capacity because of the 2010 closure of the Willow Run General Motors powertrain plant, which once demanded millions of gallons daily.

The Saline Township data center will instead rely on closed-loop technology in which cooling water is recycled through the system, reducing a facility’s water use to that of a typical office building.

The water savings come with a tradeoff: Closed loop cooling gobbles up more electricity because the cooling water must be repeatedly re-chilled.

How much money will taxpayers lose because of subsidies?

At least $90 million through 2050, according to a Senate Fiscal Agency analysis.

It’s likely much more than that, if Michigan’s experience is anything like that of other states with data center exemptions. In Illinois, for instance, a single Facebook data center has received $287 million in tax benefits in exchange for investing $4.6 billion.

Developers of the Saline Township data center have called it a $7 billion investment — an amount that would trigger some $420 million in tax exemptions if every invested dollar qualified for the subsidy.

Beyond the state-level exemptions, data center developers often seek local property tax breaks worth millions of dollars annually. The Saline Township facility, for example, will get a 50% discount on local taxes.

How do data centers affect electricity rates?

It depends how utilities structure their contracts with the new customers.

Historically, rising power demand has helped keep electricity rates down by creating more customers to help maintain the poles, wires and other fixed costs of the energy grid.

Done right, adding data centers to the system could have a similar effect, said Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps. But the sheer quantity of power they demand poses challenges because “we’re talking about gigawatt additions at a time.”

Transmission infrastructure for the Saline Township data center alone is projected to cost $500 million, according to figures DTE submitted to the Public Service Commission.

If Consumers Energy’s projected data center demand materializes, company officials anticipate transmission costs of up to $780 million.

Some studies claim data centers will increase power bills, while others have found the added load growth caused by data centers helps lower rates.

Jester said the impact on rates in Michigan will depend how utilities structure their contracts with data center developers.

State law requires data centers to absorb the cost of system upgrades meant to serve them so ratepayers don’t wind up subsidizing the industry’s hefty energy use.

In early November, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved a rate structure for data centers in Consumers Energy territory that aims to protect residents by locking data centers into long-term contracts and requiring Consumers to prove that the facilities will pay all costs for infrastructure that serves them.

That order doesn’t apply to DTE Energy, which wants to negotiate ad hoc contracts with customers.

It filed a draft 19-year contract for the Saline Township data center with state energy regulators this month and requested swift approval without a public hearing — prompting howls from environmentalists and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

“Our energy future is far too important to leave to the rushed and secret negotiations of the companies standing to profit most from our ratepaying utility customers and the decisions of the MPSC,” Nessel said in a statement Tuesday.

How many jobs do they provide?

Despite their size, data centers typically provide few direct, permanent jobs. They function primarily as warehouses for computers, with little ongoing need for human labor.

Each facility in Michigan must employ at least 30 people to qualify for sales and use tax exemptions. Developers of the Saline Township data center have said they will hire 450 people.

But some corporations have a history of failing to deliver on promises, including data center developers.

Why do they all seem to be built on farmland?

For the same reason subdivisions, big box stores and factories keep popping up on farmland: It’s a cheap and easy place to build.

“It’s already cleared,” said Sarah Mills, a regional planner who directs the University of Michigan’s Center for EmPowering Communities. “That helps make development easy for anything.”

Hyperscale data centers, whose massive buildings are often the size of multiple football fields, have the added need for vast tracts of land.

But not all farmland is created equal: Developers tend to seek out properties adjacent to high-voltage power lines capable of transporting vast quantities of energy.

That’s also true for wind and solar developers, Mills noted, which is why “it’s some of the same communities that are getting approached for energy and for data centers.”

From Johnston County to Durham and Wake Counties, Mecklenberg County, and Gaston County, these projects will bring new manufacturing, life sciences, and finance jobs to the state — located in urban cores, as well as growing rural communities.

Vulcan Elements, a manufacturer of rare earth magnets, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing $918 million in the Johnston County community of Benson. The company’s 1 million-square-foot facility will become the largest magnet factory in the world outside of China, and will help the U.S. reshore this crucial component of the supply chain for many defense and commercial electronics.

North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced the final site selection on November 19 at the Benson facility. “The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Gov. Stein. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ next stage,” said Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin. “We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation, and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three. And as we create 1,000 new American jobs, we will tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries—from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to military veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy machinery, and serving their country.”

The announcement follows Vulcan Elements’ $1.4 billion partnership with the United States Government to build a 100% vertically-integrated, domestic magnet supply chain with the company’s upstream partner ReElement Technologies. As United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick stated: “Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers. We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

Maersk, FIT Precast, Aspida Financial Services & Novartis

Maersk, a global shipping company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, is creating 520 jobs and investing $16 million in Charlotte. The site will be home to the company’s North American headquarters. Maersk already has a sizable presence in Charlotte, and with this move, will eventually employ over 1,300 people in the Queen City.

Said Charles van der Steene, President, North America Region at Maersk, “We have substantially grown and transformed our North American business, and workforce, on our path to become an integrated logistics partner for our customers. As we looked to the future, we realized an official North American headquarters would allow us to even better serve our customers and continue to build a workplace where everyone can thrive. For more than two decades, we’ve built strong relationships and a solid foundation in Charlotte. We’re excited to deepen our roots in this vibrant community and in the North America region.

FIT Precast, an industrial concrete product manufacturer, is creating 125 jobs and investing $102 million in the Gaston County community of Gastonia. The company will build its headquarters and a concrete pipe production facility at the site, which will be the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the U.S.

“The demand for resilient, American-made infrastructure has never been greater, and North Carolina is the ideal place to meet that challenge,” said Matt Goreski, President of FIT Precast. “This flagship headquarters and production facility is the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the country; investing in both leading-edge technology and the people of North Carolina with high paying, meaningful careers. The Gaston County EDC and the State of North Carolina consistently went above and beyond to secure this project, we would like to thank them for making this our new home.”

Aspida Financial Services, a life insurance and annuity company, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing over $28 million in Durham County. The company will locate to the former IQVIA building along I-40 and make the location its headquarters. A member of Aspida Holdings Ltd, Aspida Financial Services was founded in 2020 and is based in Durham. The fast-growing financial services company has more than $25 billion in assets. “Aspida’s expansion in our home city of Durham reinforces our commitment to the local community, and to our continued growth in North Carolina,” said Lou Hensley, CEO and President of Aspida. “The Triangle’s support of business advancement, expanding infrastructure, and heavy focus on technology create the right environment for our quickly growing organization to thrive. We are excited to continue to support the community in which we work and live.”

“Aspida’s decision to scale its headquarters in Durham reflects the strength of our state’s talent pipeline and the collaborative spirit of our economic development partners,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “We look forward to supporting the growth of other home-grown North Carolina companies.”

Novartis, a life sciences company, is investing $771 million in three sites across Wake County and Durham County. The sites will house a small-molecule manufacturing facility, large-molecule manufacturing facility, and a fill-finish facility. Novartis, as part of an incentive agreement with the state of North Carolina, will create a total of 380 jobs across all three projects. However, the company anticipates exceeding that total and plans to hire upwards of 700 people at the three locations.

In the third quarter of 2025, clean energy and transportation investment in the United States totaled $75 billion, representing the highest quarter of investment on record. This growth, a 9% increase from the previous quarter and an 8% increase from the same period in 2024, was largely driven by unprecedented electric vehicle (EV) sales. Clean investment accounted for 5.3% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, a new peak.

Retail consumer purchases of EVs and other clean technology (heat pumps, distributed generation, and storage) accounted for more than half of the total at $41 billion. This segment experienced a 19% increase quarter-on-quarter and a 17% increase compared to Q3 2024. By contrast, investments in clean energy technology manufacturing declined for a fourth consecutive quarter to $10 billion, representing a 10% decrease from the previous quarter and a 26% decrease compared to the same period last year. Investments in utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies increased by 3% quarter-on-quarter to $25 billion, up 15% compared to Q3 2024.

The pipeline of new project announcements varied across segments. Utility-scale clean electricity announcements totaled $20 billion, mostly in solar and storage, up 1% relative to the previous quarter, but down by one-third from Q3 2024. New industrial decarbonization announcements totaled $3 billion, representing a 53% quarter-on-quarter increase but a 56% decline compared to Q3 2024. Developers canceled roughly $2 billion of investments in energy and industry projects this quarter, compared to $7 billion in cancellations during the previous quarter. In manufacturing, canceled projects also totaled $2 billion, less than half of the $5 billion in Q2 2025 cancellations. Announcements in manufacturing projects stood at roughly $6 billion, mostly driven by the EV supply chain, a 27% increase quarter-on-quarter, but a 9% drop relative to this same period last year.

In addition to summarizing trends from our quarterly update to the Clean Investment Monitor, this report also analyzes industrial decarbonization technologies, which lag in converting announcements into actual spending. Only $1 of every $10 announced in this sector—which includes hydrogen and carbon management—has been invested, compared to the roughly $6 of $10 actualized in both clean electricity and manufacturing. From Q1 2018 through Q3 2025, companies have canceled $17 billion worth of industrial decarbonization projects, exceeding the $15 billion invested over the same period in constructing and installing the 57 industrial decarbonization facilities that have begun operating in the US. Looking ahead, $136 billion in outstanding investment remains to be spent across 229 projects in the pipeline that have either not broken ground or are currently under construction. This report also offers a lens into how recently surfaced lists of Department of Energy grant terminations overlap with that pipeline of outstanding investment. We find $14 billion of outstanding investment in the industrial decarbonization sector is tied to projects with potential and confirmed award terminations, representing 10% of the total outstanding investment in the space. We provide a breakdown by technology.

Investment trends

Actual clean energy and transportation investment in the US in Q3 2025 reached a new record-high, totaling $75 billion (Figure 1). This surpasses the previous peak of $70 billion in Q3 2024 and marks a 9% increase quarter-on-quarter and an 8% increase compared to this same period last year. In Q3 2025, clean investment accounted for 5.3% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods nationwide, the highest share of investment on record, driven largely by a surge in EV sales (Figure 2).

We categorize our clean investment tracking into three segments: investment in the manufacture of GHG emission-reducing technology (“manufacturing”); investment in the deployment of that technology, both to produce clean energy or decarbonize industrial production (“energy and industry”); and investment through the purchase and installation of that technology by individual households and businesses (“retail”). Each dollar figure in this report reflects actual investment—the real dollars spent in the given quarter on retail purchases, facility construction, and equipment purchase and installation. For facilities, we track actual capital expenditures invested over the construction timeline once a project breaks ground. In the following sections of this report, we summarize actual and announced investments, which provide context and insight into potential future actual investments.

Retail investment accounted for 54% of total clean investment in Q3 2025 at $41 billion, with over three-fourths (76%) of spending in this segment attributed to EV sales. Actual retail investment increased 19% relative to the previous quarter, and 17% compared to Q2 2024. Manufacturing investment decreased for a fourth consecutive quarter to $10 billion, falling 10% quarter-on-quarter and down 26% compared to Q3 2024. In the energy and industry segment, $25 billion was invested in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, a modest 3% increase from the previous quarter, and a 15% increase compared to Q3 2024. This quarter saw cancellations of $2 billion worth of investment in clean technology manufacturing projects, and another $2 billion in clean electricity and industrial decarbonization projects.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing investment dropped by 10% from Q2 2025 and declined 26% compared to Q3 2024. The EV supply chain—critical minerals, batteries, vehicle assembly, and charging equipment—remained the dominant force in clean manufacturing investment, accounting for $8 billion (83%) of the total $10 billion in actual investment (Figure 4). This level of EV supply chain investment reflects a 15% drop from Q2 2025 levels and 30% below the same period last year. Battery manufacturing investment fell by 23% quarter-on-quarter to $6 billion and declined a sizeable 37% relative to Q3 2024. Investment in solar manufacturing projects totaled around $2 billion in Q3 2025, up 34% from Q2 2025 and 6% from the same period last year.

Companies announced $6 billion in new manufacturing projects in Q3 2025, a 27% increase from the previous quarter but down 9% from Q3 2024, and representing the second-lowest quarter of announcements on record since Q2 2021, right behind Q2 2025. Most (99%) announcements in Q3 2025 were made in the EV supply chain, with $1 billion announced for batteries and close to $5 billion in EV projects.

During this period, companies canceled $2 billion worth of projects, the fourth-highest quarter on record after $2 billion of cancellations in Q3 2024, $5 billion in Q2 2025, and $7 billion in Q1 2025. Battery manufacturing made up most of the total cancellations for Q3 2025, while EV manufacturing projects drove most of last quarter’s cancellations.

Energy and industry

In Q3 2025, the US saw a total of $25 billion in actual investment in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization: up 3% quarter-on-quarter and up 15% relative to the same period in 2024. This represents the highest level of quarterly investment in this segment on record. Within energy and industry, most investment (96%) went towards clean electricity at an invested value of $24 billion, with the remaining $1 billion going towards industrial decarbonization projects.

Utility-scale solar and storage installations continued to dominate clean electricity investment, accounting for $17 billion, a 5% decrease from the previous quarter and a 3% decrease from this same period last year (Figure 5). In contrast, wind investment recorded a fifth consecutive quarterly increase, rising by 31% from the previous quarter to $7 billion in Q3 2025, marking the highest quarter of investment since 2020.

‍

Industrial decarbonization investment declined 12% quarter-on-quarter and 23% relative to Q3 2024 (Figure 6). Hydrogen continues to lead actual investment in industry at $465 million, down 8% from the previous quarter and 12% compared to Q3 2024. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investment dropped to $152 million, a 22% decline quarter-on-quarter and a sizeable 62% dip compared to Q3 2024. Carbon management investment was down 22% from the previous quarter, to $123 million. Clean fuels saw $87 million of investment, and $74 million was invested in clean iron and steel production, roughly on par with the level of investment in both technologies during the previous quarter.

‍

The pipeline of new energy projects expanded slightly in Q3 2025, with the addition of $20 billion in new utility electricity project announcements, representing a 1% increase from the previous quarter but down by one-third from the same period last year. Most (96%) of these announcements continue to be from solar and storage.

Industry announcements totaled $3 billion, representing a 53% increase compared to the previous quarter, but still down 56% relative to Q3 2024. So far in 2025, companies have announced $2 billion of investment each quarter, on average, a stark difference from the $8 billion quarterly average level of announcements in 2024 and $10 billion in 2023. We focus here on averages to provide clarity on the annual momentum for US industrial decarbonization projects.

Cancellations across the energy and industry segment reached $2 billion this quarter, down 73% from the previous quarter, but up 22% compared to Q3 2024. Solar, storage, and hydrogen cancellations contributed most to this total.

Retail

Consumer spending on zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), distributed renewable electricity generation and storage, and heat pumps totaled $41 billion in Q3 2025, a new record high quarter. This level of spending represents a 19% increase from Q2 2025, and a 17% increase from the previous peak of $35 billion in Q3 2024.

Investments in ZEVs drove this surge, reaching $31 billion—a record uptick in ZEV sales at a 32% increase from the previous quarter and 30% from the same period last year. This quarter, capped by the September 30 sunset of EV consumer tax credits, marks a new record high for investment in ZEVs (Figure 7).

Distributed electricity generation and storage investment fell 4% from the previous quarter and down 5% compared to Q3 2024, totaling $4 billion in investment. This marks the second consecutive quarter of decline. Investments in heat pumps, which stood at $6 billion, declined both quarter-on-quarter and relative to Q3 2024, by 15% and 17%, respectively. Consumer tax credits to support the purchase and installation of these technologies also expire at the end of this year.

Assessing industrial decarbonization investments amid DOE funding turbulence

The Clean Investment Monitor tracks investment since 2018 in emerging climate technologies—hydrogen, SAF, other clean fuels, carbon management, and new approaches to decarbonizing the production of cement, iron and steel, and pulp and paper—that aim to reduce industry emissions, the second highest-emitting sector in the US. From the start of 2018 through Q3 2025 (September 30, 2025), companies have invested $15 billion in constructing and installing new industrial decarbonization facilities, and 57 projects have started operating across the country. Looking ahead, $136 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on 229 announced projects that have not yet broken ground or are currently under construction. This pipeline excludes $17 billion worth of projects that have been canceled, underscoring the headwinds facing these early-stage technologies.

Compared to clean electricity investment—also captured within the Clean Investment Monitor’s energy and industry segment—industrial decarbonization lags in converting announcements into spending. Only $1 of every $10 announced since Q1 2018 has been invested as of Q3 2025, significantly less than the roughly $6 in every $10 that has been actualized in both clean electricity and manufacturing projects we track. This low ratio of investment relates to the early-stage nature of many industrial decarbonization technologies, which are generally dependent on a mix of external public and private funding, as well as policy initiatives to facilitate commercialization, and often contingent on securing offtake agreements for their product.

Recent turbulence in federal funding awards from the Department of Energy (DOE), particularly through the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, could further complicate industrial decarbonization—especially for the 64% of projects that have not yet broken ground. In October 2025, DOE announced nearly $8 billion in funding terminations for more than 200 energy projects, revoking over 300 awards. Days later, an unconfirmed list detailing these and additional grant terminations circulated on Capitol Hill. These actions follow $4 billion in funding terminations announced in May 2025 for 24 clean energy grants. Though not all the projects appearing on these lists fall within the Clean Investment Monitor’s scope of coverage, we cross-walked the available information with our database to identify industrial decarbonization projects subject to potential or confirmed termination of DOE awards. We find $14 billion in outstanding investment is tied to the projects included on those award termination lists, representing 10% of the outstanding industrial decarbonization investment, and spread unevenly across technologies (Figure 8).

First-of-a-kind facilities aiming to produce decarbonized cement and pulp & paper appear to be most exposed to the DOE award terminations. For cement, projects appearing on the award termination lists account for roughly $2 billion of total announced investment—representing about 93% of the sector overall and 99% of outstanding investment. The single announced US facility for producing decarbonized pulp and paper also appeared on an award termination list, thus representing 100% of outstanding investment in this nascent space. Low-carbon iron and steel, by contrast, is further along in terms of actualized investment, with 86% of the $4 billion announced projects already invested since 2018. None of the remaining outstanding investment is tied to the award termination lists.

In carbon management, which includes direct air capture, point-source capture in the power sector, and carbon dioxide utilization and removal, only 5% of the total $29 billion announced in this sector since 2018 has been invested, leaving 95% of the investment outstanding. Projects tied to $7 billion of outstanding investment, almost one-fourth of the yet-to-be-realized $28 billion in spending, appeared on the award termination lists.

Hydrogen projects tracked by the Clean Investment Monitor include both green hydrogen produced with electrolyzers powered by clean electricity and blue hydrogen production that integrates carbon capture, which together have attracted more than $61 billion of announced investment since 2018. Companies have canceled more than $7 billion of projects, including some that were already under construction, while $5 billion has been invested, primarily in green hydrogen. Another $50 billion remains outstanding across all hydrogen projects. Several hydrogen-production facilities in our tracking are associated with seven hydrogen hubs that have appeared on the award termination lists. Collectively, these account for $5 billion or 9% of the outstanding investment in hydrogen as of Q3 2025.

SAF and other clean fuels projects stand out as sectors that did not appear on the award termination lists. SAF, produced through various production processes from waste-derived feedstocks, accounts for 30% of all industrial decarbonization investment, at around $4 billion. Still, 92%, or $53 billion, of announced SAF investment remains outstanding as of Q3 2025. Clean fuels, including ethanol produced with carbon capture, have a narrower pipeline of $2 billion in outstanding investment, equivalent to 88% of announcements in this technology since 2018.

In Q4, we will be monitoring the impact of the DOE award terminations and changes to tax incentives enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on the industrial decarbonization landscape. Many projects rely on complex funding arrangements that include federal cost-sharing combined with state or municipal support, equity investors, and long-term offtake agreements. Early signals of the ripple effect from federal award terminations would include construction pauses, revisions to project timelines, or private-sector partnerships emerging to fill funding gaps.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e31ae6c5fd44b10ff405a7/691e1686564fc96982dc1d1e_hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:04.911543

Federal energy policy has been the subject of such rancorous political debate that fossil fuels, renewable energy and electric vehicles have become part of the culture wars dividing people across the United States.

But while the federal government continues picking winners and losers among energy technologies, Texas demonstrates an affordable and reliable path to achieving American energy resilience that repeatedly prioritizes practicality over ideology.

To be certain, the state has had its fair share of reliability challenges in recent years, and extreme weather will continue to be a risk to our energy infrastructure. But Texas is blessed with tremendous natural gas, wind and solar resources, and embracing these with an all-of-the-above strategy has kept the state’s electricity prices affordable in recent years. Equally important, Texas has shown that resources must stand on their own economic merits. If they don’t deliver affordable, reliable energy in practice — not just on paper — they don’t scale here.

Electricity rates for residential and business customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are 24% lower than the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That won’t seem low enough to Texan households struggling to pay bills, but rates would be substantially higher without the solar power and energy storage capacity brought online here in recent years. We’ve seen the results of this development in the AI-powered wholesale price forecasts we produce for ERCOT.

Amperon’s data shows that both day ahead and real time market prices have trended down significantly over the last four years as ERCOT’s solar capacity has increased by more than 200%.

With no fuel costs, solar operates at a low marginal cost, pushing market prices down. Thanks to ERCOT’s competitive market structure, wholesale cost savings make their way not just to investors but also to customers.

The dynamics are the same for wind power, but the development of new wind generation hasn’t moved as quickly as solar has in recent years. Combined, though, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas. The rapid installation of battery storage is also expanding the impact of low-cost renewables by storing and discharging excess generation during other times of high demand.

But affordability isn’t just about wholesale market dynamics; it’s also about designing rules that incentivize the right behaviors for consumers.

In Houston, for example, many retail providers offer free power at night or on weekends, which encourages customers to shift usage when the grid has excess supply. Programs like smart EV charging reward Texans for plugging in cars when it makes the most sense for the grid and their pocketbooks. These are the kinds of consumer-friendly market rules that keep our system efficient, innovative and fair.

Unfortunately, when it comes to affordability, this may be about as good as it gets. Energy Innovation, one of the many research groups modeling the economic impacts of recent federal legislation, projects the unwinding of tax credits for carbon-neutral generation will keep Texas from gaining another 77 GW of solar and wind power, which is almost equivalent to the entire state’s current peak demand on hot summer days.

Without new solar and wind, projected increases in future demand will have to be met by running existing thermal generation, which will put upward pressure on market prices. Although one could argue that if prices go up as much as Energy Innovation predicts (up to 54% for residential and business customers), the data centers and other commercial enterprises expected to arrive in the state won’t ever come.

The sudden policy swing isn’t just about affordability and economic growth though, because diverse electricity generation also makes ERCOT more resilient. The combination of natural gas, wind, solar and batteries (not to mention nuclear and hydro) keeps the power grid from being overly dependent on any single type of generation. For example, in late July, 5,019 MW of coal-fired generation went offline without causing an emergency.

Diversification creates the flexibility to absorb future disruptions in fuel supply too, and it decentralizes the entire system, making it less vulnerable to the kind of widespread outage that happened with Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Texas is also paving the way for next-generation nuclear power with several small modular reactor projects greenlit, supported in part by the state’s newly created Texas Energy Fund. Nuclear won’t be the largest source anytime soon, but it adds a stable, carbon-free option to the state’s diversified mix.

Integrating large amounts of solar and wind was always going to require a period of operational adjustment, especially until the system had enough battery capacity to respond rapidly to unexpected mismatches in supply and demand. But this combination of new solar and battery capacity is why there were no Energy Emergency Alerts in 2024, despite “extended high summer peak periods,” according to the recent Assessment of Reliability Performance report published by TexasRE. The assessment also found the chance of rolling blackouts this summer is just 0.3% — down from 12% last summer (when, it should be noted, there were no blackouts).

Regardless of what’s being said at the national level, we know from watching the Texas market closely that ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas was right when he told a House Committee meeting earlier this year that “the market, as structured today, is very well suited to support the growth trajectories that we’re seeing increase in the state of Texas.”

Texas boasts a competitive marketplace with low barriers to entry, renewable energy zones for easier planning and non-partisan energy debates that have helped keep industry-friendly regulations in place. These policies and diverse generation sources absolutely affect the day-to-day market prices we forecast and track.

In short, the highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4KExPXRr_eBX86TwFqNBh396fRG4wo1jZOT81i82b7U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzAzMzk3NDc2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-20 11:05:45.145860

The strange thing is that a host of Trump’s tariffs have nothing to do with those two, sometimes-acceptable objectives.
This is true, without question, with regard to large tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year on imported coffee.
Still, American consumers love coffee, and they clearly resent the 19% single-year price hike on coffee caused almost entirely by Trump’s tariffs.
In 2024, before the Trump coffee tariffs took effect, coffee was, by value, the fourth largest item imported in New Orleans, at slightly more than $1 billion.","President Donald Trump is spectacularly mercurial in economic policy decisions, but for now, Louisiana is benefiting from his latest policy effusions.

Indeed, the state's economy received two major boosts from the Trump administration in the past 10 days, one related to coffee and one to energy production — although the first boost stems from Trump reversing one of his own, misbegotten policies.

The policy reversal involves Trump’s bizarre fetish for import tariffs. Every observer with an ounce of sense recognized that at least in the near term, U.S. consumer prices would rise on just about every good or item subject to higher tariffs. Trump all along has insisted that foreigners, not Americans, actually pay tariffs, but of course, that’s just factually incorrect. Now, though, with the average U.S. family paying $700 more so far this year for “basic” items, a recent poll shows the public largely blaming the tariffs, of which the public disapproves by a nearly two-to-one margin. The public is right. From a standpoint of basic economics, most of Trump’s tariffs make no sense.

Granted, there can be two arguably good reasons for tariffs. One is to punish an unambiguous adversary by deterring demand from the otherwise large U.S. market for the adversary’s products. Even then, though, it helps to acknowledge that U.S. consumers are taking a hit in the name of the nation’s greater good.

The second reason that sometimes holds true, although nowhere near as often as tariff supporters insist, is to bolster a domestic industry whose very existence is crucial for national security in case, Lord forbid, of a major war.

The strange thing is that a host of Trump’s tariffs have nothing to do with those two, sometimes-acceptable objectives. This is true, without question, with regard to large tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year on imported coffee. Coffee surely is not an essential element of our national security apparatus, and the mainland U.S. features almost no domestic coffee production to protect anyway. Almost nowhere in the country’s mainland is the climate right for growing the stuff.

Still, American consumers love coffee, and they clearly resent the 19% single-year price hike on coffee caused almost entirely by Trump’s tariffs.

That’s why, as a clear political necessity, Trump on Nov. 14 abandoned his tariffs on coffee, along with those on bananas, tomatoes and other foods used almost everyday in American home kitchens.

The removal of the coffee tariffs is doubly good news for Louisiana. Not only are Louisiana consumers likely to pay less for our cups of joe going forward, but our job base should benefit significantly.

This newspaper in the past eight months has featured a number of news and opinion pieces highlighting the importance of the coffee trade in Louisiana, along with the damage done to it by the tariffs. Coffee comes through several Louisiana ports and is an especially important commodity at the Port of New Orleans. In 2024, before the Trump coffee tariffs took effect, coffee was, by value, the fourth largest item imported in New Orleans, at slightly more than $1 billion.

In turn, coffee distributors and roasters here provide thousands of direct jobs in Louisiana (1,600 in coffee production alone, not to mention retail positions), and of course, coffee plays a huge role in the state’s dining scene that is a keystone of the tourism industry.

Trump’s reversal, therefore, is great news for the Bayou State.

Meanwhile, Trump needed no reversal in policies in order to help Louisiana’s oil and gas industry. He has always been strongly pro-oil exploration. On Nov. 11, that inclination bore fruit as the administration released a call for energy-company bids for some 80 million acres in the central and western Gulf. The leases, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, result largely from new policies adopted in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act Trump pushed through Congress with a major assist from House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, both of Louisiana.

Even better, that same bill raises the amount of revenue from Gulf leases that flows directly to four coastal states, with Louisiana likely to get an extra $46 million per year. Combined with the added jobs from the new leases and related businesses that service the oil industry, and the tax revenues produced from those, this is obviously a considerable windfall for the whole state.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/30/0305e0e9-4930-537e-829b-0154c7979194/691246a740be0.image.jpg?crop=1661%2C872%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-20 17:02:01.634788

Ohioans and Environmental Organizations File Lawsuit Challenging Constitutionality of Air Pollution Amendment in State Budget

Columbus, OH — On Thursday, October 30th, the Ohio Environmental Council, Sierra Club, SOBE Concerned Citizens, Donna Ballinger, and the Freshwater Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Their complaint alleges that select sections of H.B. 96, Ohio’s state budget passed this summer, violate the One-Subject Rule of the Ohio Constitution.

The Ohio General Assembly snuck anti-environment provisions into H.B. 96 at the last minute that removed important protections for Ohioans who want to file complaints against polluters while taking away Ohioans’ ability to protect themselves using community air monitoring data. These statutory changes have no relationship to Ohio’s budget and thus violate the Ohio Constitution’s requirement that all legislation include only one subject.

Key Facts about the Unconstitutional Provisions

H.B. 96 created R.C. 3704.0310, which requires the Ohio EPA to repeal the Air Nuisance Rule provisions of its Clean Air Act State Implementation Plan.

The Air Nuisance Rule has historically provided an enforcement mechanism for Ohioans to hold polluters accountable for their nuisance pollution impacting fenceline communities.

H.B. 96 also amended R.C. 3704.01, among other provisions, prohibiting the Ohio EPA from relying on “community air monitoring,” data collected by community members using community air monitors installed throughout their community to protect them from air pollution.

Together, these provisions form the Air Pollution Amendment to H.B. 96, which does not include any appropriations or language relevant to Ohio’s state budget.

Counsel from the Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic, AltmanNewman, Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, and the Ohio Environmental Council represent the parties.

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Neil Waggoner, Midwest Beyond Coal Campaign Manager for the Sierra Club:

“Ohio’s Air Nuisance Rule has been a critical tool for the public to hold polluters accountable for decades. There has been strong opposition to efforts to roll this rule back for years, which might be part of the reason why the legislature snuck it into the budget bill and conducted no public debate on their scheme. The legislature’s action was not just a violation of the single subject rule; it’s a violation of the public trust and seeks to further violate our rights to take action to protect our communities from polluters.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services:

“At Fair Shake, we believe that everyone should have the right to make decisions about the air, water, and land where they live. This unconstitutional attack attempts to strip Ohioans of their ability to hold polluters accountable through public monitoring and the courts. That is why we are proud to join this lawsuit alongside the Case Western Environmental Law Clinic, the Ohio Environmental Council, and Altman Newman.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Leatra Harper on behalf of Freshwater Accountability:

“At the behest of industry, the Ohio legislature took away the Air Nuisance Rule that has been available for over fifty years to residents seeking protection from harmful air pollution. The people need this rule, and its removal harms the ability of everyday Ohioans to protect themselves from toxic air pollution. This is another example of some legislators in Ohio caring more about protecting polluters than protecting Ohioans.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Lynn Anderson on behalf of SOBE Concerned Citizens:

“The Ohio legislature needs to provide stronger protections for the citizens of Ohio against toxic air pollution in the form of stricter regulation, monitoring, and remediation. By taking away the Air Nuisance Rule and community monitoring provisions, however, they are weakening our existing protections and leaving Ohio communities harmed by toxic air pollution behind.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Dave Altman of AltmanNewman Co. LPA:

“If this illegal action by the State is not corrected, you will still be free to defend your property with firearms, but not with air monitors.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Chris Tavenor, General Counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council (OEC):

“The Ohio General Assembly has once again violated the Ohio Constitution by slipping substantive provisions into its budget bill that have nothing to do with the state budget. This action, on its own, needs to be called out as unconstitutional. But the impact it has on Ohioans seeking to protect their communities from air pollution is just as harmful. The General Assembly should be applauding Ohioans who gather data about air pollution and use it to hold polluters accountable, rather than punishing them.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Miranda Leppla, Director of Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic:

“Everyday Ohioans merely trying to protect themselves and their loved ones from dangerous air pollution have been robbed of the ability to do so through a violation of a basic tenant of Ohio’s Constitution—that Ohioans should be able to advocate for or against legislation that they care about. These Plaintiffs aim to restore Ohioans’ ability to remedy air pollution impacting their families and to remind the Ohio Legislature that they serve the people, not polluters.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-20 15:01:44+00:00,News From The States,"Energy-rich Campbell County wants nuclear, but not its radioactive waste",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energy-rich-campbell-county-wants-nuclear-not-its-radioactive-waste,"The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally.
That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage.
While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler.
Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming.
“It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste.","Top officials in one of the nation’s most energy-prolific counties — home to uranium mining, oil, natural gas and the most productive coal-mining district in North America — are cautiously supportive of the nuclear energy industry’s burgeoning interest in northeast Wyoming.

But they don’t want its radioactive waste.

The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally. That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage. In anticipation that could change, the Campbell County resolution urges state lawmakers to allow “citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

The five-member commission voted 4-1 in favor of the position, with Commissioner Jim Ford casting the single “no” vote. The county solicited public input on the matter for several weeks and redrafted the resolution multiple times, most recently during a Nov. 13 workshop. Commissioner Jerry Means said he proposed the resolution amid growing interest in Wyoming from nuclear energy companies, as well as often intense public debate about nuclear energy’s risks and benefits.

Opponents of the resolution, before and after Tuesday’s vote, warned it may send a signal to the industry, and to BWXT in particular, that it is not welcome in the community. While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler. He’s frequently credited for the industry’s recent interest in setting up manufacturing shops in Wyoming.

“So any resolutions against nuclear, they’re going to take very seriously,” Wandler recently told WyoFile. “They’re just going to go away and find someplace else to bring those jobs and to bring that revenue.”

Wandler and other nuclear energy industry supporters note that people sometimes conflate BWXT’s plans in Campbell County with a different proposal in Natrona County. Radiant Industries, unlike BWXT, did include storing spent nuclear fuel, but the California-based company scrapped its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in October. The company cited a lack of “regulatory certainty” about whether the state would further loosen its ban on nuclear fuel waste storage — a key change in law needed to accommodate Radiant’s plan to store spent fuel from its microreactors at a campus outside the town of Bar Nunn.

Reached for comment after the resolution was passed, BWXT said it isn’t shying away from Campbell County.

“The resolution does not impact our proposed plans for a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Gillette as our facility will neither create nor store high-level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel,” BWXT Advanced Nuclear Fuels Senior Director Josh Parker told WyoFile via email.

Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming. Industry skeptics have also expressed fears that the federal government might force either an interim or permanent storage facility in a community that doesn’t want it.

“We all know laws can be changed every year,” Means said. “So this is basically getting out ahead of what I see for the future for Campbell County, because I do see people in our county, right here, [who] think that maybe we need to accept nuclear waste.”

The resolution

The commission’s 2-page resolution declared adherence to “the following guidelines regarding nuclear waste storage in Campbell County.”

No interim nuclear storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No consolidated interim storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No deep geological repository (caverns);

No deep geological repository (bore hole);

No exemptions granted for interim or consolidated storage, or geological repositories.

But what authorities or policy tools the county might use to enforce the guidelines are unclear.

According to the resolution, the commission “supports the development and siting of the nuclear industry in Campbell County, if such facilities do not produce, receive, or store nuclear waste, except what is currently permitted by Wyoming law as of the date of this resolution.”

“We can’t override the state or the federal government,” Means told WyoFile. “It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste. It really has no [legal] backbone.”

It also notes that “current Wyoming law does not allow for the people to vote on the specific issue of nuclear waste storage,” and resolves that “the Campbell County Board of Commissioners supports any change in state law that would allow citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

Though several Wyoming lawmakers suspect there will be another attempt in the upcoming budget session to crack the door open wider for nuclear waste storage, it’s unclear whether there might be forthcoming legislation to allow for some kind of public referendum on the issue.

“Our resolution essentially says that, ‘Yeah, the Legislature should change the law to allow the citizens to vote on the issue,'” Commissioner Scott Clem, a former Wyoming representative, told WyoFile.

Radiant fallout

While opponents cheered Radiant’s pullout from Natrona County, the move shook many in the business community, particularly at the state level.

Gov. Mark Gordon pinned the blame on the far right of the Wyoming GOP.

“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement in October. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”

Though it was not directly part of the Governor’s Business Forum agenda last week in Laramie, Radiant’s exit was a topic of discussion in the hallways and sometimes on the stage.

Many attendees “[are] mad about a certain project in the Natrona County area,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell told the audience of about 500. “Why did we lose that? Because the vocal minority.”

For its part, the business council is ramping up efforts to garner support for nuclear energy development in Wyoming, according to Dorrell, both in general and for BWXT’s project in Campbell County, in particular.

The state is putting its financial might behind the project as well.

The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended a $100 million state grant to support BWXT’s TRISO fuel manufacturing project. The grant, if approved by Gordon, would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/camc011763653428.jpg?h=29234840&itok=wn46FwXC,N,,2025-11-20 11:03:52.750673
