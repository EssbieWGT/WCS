In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care.","With the Federal Government renaming and redefining the mission of the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” it’s time for the solar, wind, and renewable energy industries to declare the quiet part out loud: The U.S. government is waging a financial and regulatory war against the development and deployment of renewable energy.

You might think that a “war on solar” is aggressive language. But this war is far from a secret. The President, his cabinet, and many conservative lawmakers publicly attack renewables as “the green new scam” and spread misinformation about its cost and reliability. Sadly, their aggressive actions speak even louder than their words.

Not only has the Trump administration redefined NREL, but they’ve also taken numerous actions to defund and aggressively regulate the development and deployment of renewable energy, including:

Leading the repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies.

Using presidential executive orders to add hurdles to renewable energy development and favor more expensive fossil fuels.

Cancelling approved permits for renewable energy and transmission projects that are already under construction.

Clawing back hundreds of millions in grants for community solar and grants for low-income people.

Proposing that fossil fuel pollution isn’t harmful to our health.

Laying off thousands of Federal environmental, pollution, and renewable energy researchers, lawyers, and administrators.

In short, the Trump administration has weaponized the government to do everything in its power—no pun intended—to slow down renewable energy’s growth. There is no longer a level playing field or an “all-the-above” U.S. energy strategy. For this administration, U.S. “energy dominance” refers mainly to fossil fuels and expensive nuclear power.

If they win, the casualties will be good-paying jobs, small and large renewable energy businesses, cleaner air, and climate action. America will also become less competitive with China. Worst of all for everyone, electricity prices are going to continue to rise.

But here’s the good news: I know that we can and will win this war. Why? Follow the money: Despite all these challenges, solar and energy storage are still the cheapest to and fastest way to build new capacity for the grid. Nuclear, gas, and coal can’t compete for speed or cost.

But economics and technology can’t win this war alone. For renewables to truly win, we need to win the hearts and minds of local and national policymakers and consumers.

Like any war, we need strong public support. The public—especially voters—must be aware and care that solar, wind, battery, and other new energy and “electrotech” companies are unfairly being attacked.

Likewise, the same people must understand that these industries are directly affecting their lives by:

Decreasing electricity bills.

Supporting self-reliance and energy independence.

Inexpensively powering new AI data centers.

Creating new jobs today and for the future.

Helping farmers preserve their land and earn extra income.

Contributing local tax revenue where we build projects.

Earning a return for energy investors.

Helping America innovate and compete against China and other global tech competitors.

Decreasing pollution and its health, environmental, and financial costs.

And did I mention decreasing electricity bills? That’s worth repeating.

Beyond lawsuits and lobbying, the way to defend our valuable industries is through consistent, positive, accurate, creative communications that flood social media, influencers, and front-page headlines. This will generate social media conflicts, but that conflict will inspire conversations that will eventually neutralize anti-renewable energy propaganda.

This war of words playbook isn’t new. It’s pretty much a copy of the oil and gas industry’s tactics. What could be new is that the renewable energy industry finally steps up to fund and deploy our own clean energy messaging and lobbying dollars with the same media weapons.

If we don’t act now and make consumers and policymakers care about the benefits of solar, storage, and other renewables, we run the risk of being unfairly blamed or used as a scapegoat for the most important topic in everyone’s minds right now – energy affordability. While the facts are clear that solar and storage are the cheapest forms of new energy additions onto the existing grid, the misinformation campaign that the other side is waging is louder and being heard over ours. Energy economics will always win in the long run, but the long run will take some time, and I am concerned about the consistent black eye that the industry will receive in between now and then.

So far, our industry response has been muted or preaching to the solar choir. We must be more aggressive. It’s up to every renewable energy company to engage our workers, the media, family, and friends. When they casually ask how we’re doing, we must take the opportunity to say that there’s an aggressive and pointless government war against solar businesses and solar jobs. We must explain how this war is directly affecting their health, their children’s future, and their electric bills.

2026 can be renewable energy’s year to fight back. A word-of-mouth grass-roots effort can be cost-effective for the entire industry if we continually volunteer our attention, voices, and social media accounts.

This is a moment for everyone who believes in clean energy, innovation, and truth to step up. If you’re interested in organizing, contributing funds or time to a fresh fight-back campaign, join this campaign list. Let’s come together and share our ideas, dollars, and mindshare to beat this thing. By donating to support a broad public-education campaign, you can help stop misinformation in its tracks and make sure voters and communities hear the facts—not the fearmongering.

In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care. If we’re not pushing back on X, TikTok, and the news, we lose.

Congress is rushing to beat a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the annual appropriations bills to avoid another government shutdown.

Top lawmakers on the Senate and House appropriations committees released a two-bill package Sunday that contains funding for the Departments of State, Treasury and other related agencies.

The House voted 341 to 79 to pass the package, kicking it over to the Senate.

The Senate, meanwhile, is moving through procedural votes on a three-bill package that includes funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The House approved the package last week in a vote that was overwhelmingly bipartisan.

If both pieces of legislation make it to President Trump's desk, Congress will have four more appropriations bills to pass to fully fund the government through the end of the fiscal year.

But the Senate has a weeklong recess next week and the House is scheduled to be out the week after — creating a quick turnaround on the final bills, including a controversial measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.

Plans were dropped to include the Homeland Security Department appropriations in the package unveiled this week after an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota woman. Democrats have threatened to withhold their support for this funding if it does not include ICE reforms.

""It's a politically very sensitive topic,"" GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday. ""That's why we decided not to push ahead with a Homeland bill this week.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said it's ""one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.""

Cole said negotiations on the other remaining bills are ""very close"" to wrapping up and he expected passage in both chambers.

""Then we've just got to strategize how to get Homeland, if we can,"" he said. ""But most of the government should be up and functional.""

Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe.","Introduction

The 2026 Billionaire TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Act,[1] a California ballot initiative, would ostensibly impose a one-time tax of 5 percent on the net worth of the state’s billionaires. Due, however, to aggressive design choices and possible drafting errors, the actual rate on taxpayers’ net worth could be dramatically higher.

One particularly momentous policy choice has the potential to strip the founders of some of the world’s largest companies of their controlling interests and force them to sell off a significant portion of their shares. This could send stock prices plummeting to the detriment of tech employees and investors of all stripes, including ordinary workers whose 401(k)s would take a beating if Silicon Valley founders had to offload their shares in a hurry.

The poorly drafted initiative creates many scenarios in which tax liability would be vastly more than 5 percent of net worth, but this analysis focuses on six of them:

Valuation can be based on voting interests in a company when they exceed actual economic stakes.

Assessment rules for privately held businesses can substantially overvalue them.

Draconian underpayment penalties for taxpayers and potentially ruinous penalties for their appraisers encourage substantial overstatement of the value of privately held businesses to avoid a dispute with tax authorities.

Presumptive drafting errors on anti-avoidance rules result in taxing significantly more than the amount of the transfers.

Provisions regarding spousal assets and indebtedness to relatives would tax a nonresident spouse’s assets and, in the event of a divorce, would tax the California resident on formerly held assets that had been obligated to the ex-spouse in a divorce settlement.

Deferral regimes have eligibility limitations and impose additional costs, and run the risk of taxing wealth that might no longer exist.

Each of these features makes an already unprecedented tax even more destructive. If the initiative passes, California must brace for an exodus of founders and investors fleeing not just extraordinarily high tax burdens, but also the potential loss of the companies they created. A loss of jobs, startups, investment capital, and economic growth would be among the consequences of a large wave of departures, and of the tax burden on those who remain or whom state officials deem not to have escaped the clutches of the tax.

Valuation by Voting Rights Can Break Up Controlling Interests

The proposed wealth taxA wealth tax is imposed on an individual’s net wealth, or the market value of their total owned assets minus liabilities. A wealth tax can be narrowly or widely defined, and depending on the definition of wealth, the base for a wealth tax can vary. has distinct valuation methods for different asset classes and ownership structures. Publicly traded assets are valued based on the assets’ market trading value, but there are different rules for assets that are not publicly traded.

Under the initiative, “For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer’s percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.”[2]

Founders often hold private Class B or other super-voting shares with transfer restrictions preventing them from being sold to the public, but which confer voting control over a publicly traded company. Together, for instance, Larry Page and Sergey Brin own about 11.3 percent of Alphabet (Google) but control 52.3 percent of voting rights. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13.6 percent of Meta but has 61.0 percent voting control.[3]

It is possible that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), charged with administering the new tax, would determine that these shares are publicly tradable because they have an ascertainable value and can be converted into tradeable Class A shares under a dual-class structure. In that case, they would be taxed by their market value.

Of considerable concern for founders, though, is the very real possibility that they would not be considered publicly traded assets, in which case the proposed wealth tax would apply to founders’ and early investors’ share of voting rights, even if they are not at all representative of their actual economic stake in the company. This could force founders to convert their Class B shares to Class A and sell them as common stock, surrendering their controlling stakes and liquidating large portions of their investment.[4]

Two billionaires represent opposite extremes: Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, owns 2.6 percent of his company but controls 57.6 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $2.62 billion on an ownership interest worth $2.41 billion. Since selling his shares incurs capital gains taxA capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. , moreover, and the entire value of these shares is capital gains for him, his total tax liability for his DoorDash shares would be $4.17 billion—173 percent of their value. The tax would bankrupt him absent an FTB determination to set aside this valuation. (Xu’s valuation is so clearly incorrect that he would almost certainly prevail on this point. Others may have less success.)

Conversely, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA is the rare founder without preferred voting shares. His 3.8 percent stake in NVIDIA gives him 3.8 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $8.5 billion on an ownership interest worth $170 billion.

Most founders are somewhere in between, but their voting share is typically much larger than their ownership share. They would be required to sell off significant stakes in their companies to pay the tax in 2027. Those sell-offs might reduce the price they can get for the shares even though the taxable valuation would be fixed at December 31, 2026, levels, before the share liquidation. The consequences of founders relinquishing control and dumping vast holdings, moreover, would be significant—in some cases, potentially catastrophic—for employers and investors as well.

Founders could challenge the voting rights assumption, arguing that substituting their economic stake plus some control premium is necessary to avoid a substantial overstatement of liability,[5] but since drafters gave priority to voting rights with a clear understanding that they often dramatically outstrip actual ownership stakes, the FTB and the courts might be loath to permit alternative valuations in all but the most extreme cases. Furthermore, as discussed later, proposing an alternative through the submission of a certified appraisal carries its own risks.

The only other possible “out” for such founders would be the use of Optional Deferral Accounts (ODAs), discussed later, but this would also put founders under substantial constraints and would retain the inflated tax liability generated by voting interests.

The following table shows voting and ownership shares for six tech founders, with estimates of their wealth tax liability and their total liability (net of capital gains tax on the distributions made to satisfy wealth tax liability), and how that liability compares to the total value of their holdings.

Table 1. Corporate Founders Lose Controlling Interests and Face Extremely High Rates Under Wealth Tax

Note: Total Tax includes federal and California capital gains tax on liquidating assets to remit wealth tax owed. Market cap and other corporate financial data are as of January 13, 2026. Value and tax share of value are based on the estimated share of ownership in the founder’s company, excluding any other investments. Estimates assume that super-voting shares are not publicly traded assets for the purpose of the proposed wealth tax. In some cases, taxpayers may be able to pursue alternative valuation methods.

Brin and Page already cut ties with California, reportedly leaving before the January 1, 2026, residency date indicated in the initiative.[6] Since the measure’s retroactive “snapshot” assessment date is sure to draw a legal challenge, many other founders—incentivized not only by personal financial considerations but also by the desire to retain voting control over the companies they founded—may do the same should the initiative gain steam, and particularly if it is approved by the voters in November.

Assessment Rules for Private Businesses Can Substantially Overvalue Them

Private business interests are notoriously difficult to value. The initiative’s valuation rules make a challenging proposition worse by requiring systematic overstatements of business value.

Fair market value for non-public businesses is presumed to be equal to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) book value plus 7.5 times average annual profits, multiplied by the taxpayer’s percentage interest in the company.[7] Many closely held businesses do not use GAAP accounting. Beyond that initial hurdle, this approach uses an accounting concept (book profit) without regard to features that drive market pricing, including risks, cyclicality, capital intensity, regulatory exposure, and, most importantly in the case of closely held firms, illiquidity. All these factors would ordinarily translate into valuation discounts compared to a publicly traded company with similar profits, but the rules of the proposed wealth tax ignore this distinction.

The initiative also establishes a floor that can overvalue struggling businesses. If a business is posting losses, its book profits are treated as $0, not a negative value, meaning that losses do not reduce the value of the business for tax purposes.[8] Other valuation floors can lock in outdated valuations that may not reflect a company’s present-day reality.

For instance, the measure holds that a business’s value cannot be less than the valuation reflected in any funding round or equity sale within the past two years unless the taxpayer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence—a high standard—that the valuation would significantly overstate the entity’s value.[9] But a company’s value can decline in two years, and valuations in equity rounds often involve preferred terms that are not available to all owners and which would overvalue the company as a whole when used as a valuation floor.

Additionally, the initiative denies ordinary discounts for minority interests and lack of marketability, even though any realistic valuation would take these factors into account. A stake in an illiquid company is not worth as much as a similar fully liquid stake, and the ownership stake cannot be sold at a price that disregards that discount—assuming it can be sold at all.

If a taxpayer has a profit interest in a business entity, moreover, their ownership share is presumed to be at least the maximum interest in the company’s profits they may earn subject to certain conditions being met, even if those conditions have not yet been—and may never be—met.[10] This provision taxes interests the taxpayer does not actually possess.

Other provisions stipulating that fair market value excludes forced-sale pricing and treating insurance coverage as a valuation minimum can also artificially inflate business value,[11] overstating what the taxpayer’s share of the company is worth on the open market. And forced-sale pricing could be exactly what taxpayers get if they liquidate some or all of their holdings to pay the wealth tax.

Draconian Penalties Incentivize Overstatement of Liability

Some prior wealth tax proposals have charged tax authorities with valuing billionaires’ assets, including the value of their closely held (non-traded) businesses. The California initiative relieves the state of that burden and instead charges the taxpayers themselves with determining their net worth and remitting the appropriate tax on it.

For traded assets, like shares in a publicly traded company, these valuations are straightforward. For a privately held business, however, valuation is innately difficult. Particularly for startups, valuation may be speculative and uncertain, even given the valuation rules provided in the initiative. Good faith estimates could vary substantially.

The proposed wealth tax, however, does not tolerate different answers arrived at in good faith. If the FTB settles on a different valuation than the one certified by the taxpayer, then a penalty applies to any resulting underpayment: 20 percent for an understatement of tax liability that exceeds the greater of $1 million or 20 percent of the tax shown on the taxpayer’s return, and 40 percent for an understatement of liability that exceeds the greater of $10 million or 40 percent.[12] These are large amounts, to be sure, but the range of valuations one might reasonably attach to a promising tech startup pre-IPO, for instance, could easily vary by that much.

Certified appraisals could also be used when arguing for an alternative valuation for Class B shares, contending that using voting rights rather than economic stake substantially overstates the value of these holdings. It would be up to the appraiser to determine what premium to attach to their super-voting privileges, and should the FTB disagree with that determination, this could yield substantial penalties.[13]

Notably, penalties for underpayment do not end with the taxpayer. If a substantial underpayment is attributable to a certified appraisal, then the FTB is permitted to impose penalties on the appraiser at 2 or 4 percent of the understatement of tax. For an appraiser, such a penalty could be ruinous, and the result—besides any costly insurance—would be to incentivize appraisers to be more solicitous to the state, padding appraisals (particularly on hard-to-appraise businesses) to avoid serious financial penalty.

Imagine, for instance, a private business the FTB concludes is worth $6 billion. If the appraiser thought it was worth $5 billion, they could personally owe $1 million in penalties, in addition to the $10 million in penalties imposed on the taxpayer.

Poorly Drafted Anti-Avoidance Rules Can Over-Tax Transfers

The initiative’s drafters included anti-avoidance rules that, among other things, disregard transfers intended to reduce wealth tax liability. Under the proposal, for instance, a billionaire cannot transfer wealth or incur a debt to their children to reduce liability, cannot escape wealth taxation by transferring property to a trust, and cannot work around limits on such transfers by selling assets for less than market value. The way these provisions are written, however, will dramatically overstate taxable net worth in at least two ways.

First, the language captures the entire value of any trust to which assets are transferred in 2026, not just the value of that transfer. Under the proposal, “net worth shall for all purposes include the value of property held by any trust (other than a grantor trust or tax-exempt trust) to which the individual transfers property in 2026, and seventy-five percent of the value of such property transferred in 2025.”[14]

Perhaps the intention was to tax the full value of transfers made in 2026 and 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 (the extreme retroactivity of the latter provision will certainly be challenged), but as written, the initiative incorporates 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 but the full value of property held by any trust to which property was transferred in 2026. This would expose the entire trust to taxation as if it were the taxpayer’s wealth.

Curiously, a provision providing for proportional allocations if multiple people contributed to the same trust suggests that the 2026 treatment is not a drafting error, even though its implications are hard to comprehend as intentional policy and are inconsistent with the “ordinary” treatment of transfers made in 2025.[15]

Second, net worth includes “the value of any property the individual transferred . . . for less than fair market value after October 15, 2025,” provided that property’s value exceeds $1 million. This is intended to address a scenario under which a covered taxpayer “sells” an asset to a friend or family member for a trivial or deeply discounted amount, but in a way that is not a consideration-free transfer that would be disregarded under other anti-avoidance rules. As written, however, the amount added back to net worth is the entire value of the transfer, not the difference between the sale price and fair market value. If the FTB reviews a billionaire’s sale of an asset and concludes that it was underpriced, intentionally or otherwise, this provision could require that tax be paid as if the asset was never sold and was still in the possession of the taxpayer.

Elsewhere in the proposal, drafters are at pains to establish that the fair market value of an asset “shall not be . . . [t]he price that a forced sale of the property would produce,”[16] but in practice, the need to obtain liquidity to pay the tax could force taxpayers to sell assets at prices well below their ordinary market value. If a taxpayer began selling assets in 2026 in anticipation of 2027 tax liability, and did so at a discount, they could theoretically be taxed on both the forgone asset and the income it brought in. The FTB may choose not to take such an aggressive posture, but the language creates meaningful risk.

Marriage and Divorce Can Both Lead to Over-Taxation

The wealth tax’s aggressive residency rules can establish a billionaire as a California resident for wealth tax purposes even if they are not domiciled in California and are a resident in another state for income tax purposes. Consequently, it is possible for one spouse to have wealth tax residency and the other not to, even if they do not live apart by ordinary definitions. A nonresident spouse’s wealth is included in the covered taxpayer’s net worth for wealth tax purposes.

Additionally, whether one or both spouses are California residents, the tax is imposed at a household level, so a couple with a combined net worth of $1 billion or more is subject to the tax, whereas two unmarried individuals with just under $1 billion apiece would not be taxed.

These peculiarities might lead a sufficiently tax-motivated couple to revisit their marriage vows: until they are parted by death or taxes. A timely divorce could yield substantial tax savings, especially if a nonresident billionaire spouse’s wealth is swept into the tax. Whether California would acknowledge the divorce or treat it as an avoidance strategy and disregard it is unclear.

An even thornier issue arises if a billionaire couple divorces in 2026 without tax savings in mind. Debts to related persons are added back to net worth if incurred after October 15, 2025,[17] and a related person is defined as “any person that is related to the taxpayer . . . as of January 1, 2026.”[18] If a divorce resulted in a division of assets, any indebtedness to the taxpayer’s ex-spouse would be treated as if no such debt was incurred, with those assets still subject to tax.

Taxpayers could avoid this trap by finalizing divorce terms and paying out by year’s end,[19] but in some cases, they may be constrained by liquidity issues, exacerbated by the tax bill coming due.

Deferral Regimes Raise Costs and Introduce Risk

Taxpayers subject to the proposed wealth tax have the option of remitting the entire amount with their tax payment for 2026 (by April 2027) or paying it in five annual installments, subject to a 7.5 percent annual deferral charge on the remaining unpaid balance. With deferral charges, the effective rate becomes 5.75 percent of asset value as of December 31, 2026.

Investments can, of course, lose value. Businesses can fail. If an illiquid taxpayer whose wealth is tied up in their business elects to pay over five years and their net worth declines sharply during that period, then they are still liable based on their net worth as measured at the end of 2026. They could owe substantial tax on wealth that no longer exists.

Certain liquidity-constrained taxpayers would be eligible for Optional Deferral Accounts (ODA), under which tax would be owed every time income from non-traded assets was realized or any withdrawal or transfer was made, until the tax indebtedness was paid in full. Functionally, the state becomes a co-investor in the assets. If these assets appreciate in value over time, California can tax the additional accumulated wealth even if the taxpayer has long since left the state. But unlike with the five-year deferral option, if the assets decline in value, California is also a partner in that reduction in value.

These accounts are only available to those with wealth tax liability in excess of the combined value of their publicly traded assets.[20] Because capital gains tax would have to be paid on publicly traded assets sold to satisfy wealth tax liability, it would be possible for a taxpayer to have publicly traded assets worth more than their wealth tax liability but still be insufficiently liquid to cover actual liability—and be ineligible for an ODA.

Some of the language surrounding ODAs is ambiguous. However, eligibility for an ODA is a threshold question of whether publicly traded assets exceed liability, but once a taxpayer is eligible to maintain an ODA, they can only attach assets to the account “to the extent that the amount of additional tax that would be owed . . . (without the use of an ODA) would exceed the sum of the combined value of all the taxpayers’ [publicly traded] assets.”[21] This suggests that any taxpayer using an ODA must first liquidate all traded assets and use them to satisfy whatever portion of wealth tax liability they can, attaching assets to the ODA for the residual amount owed.

Founders with Class B super-voting shares may be able to place those shares in an ODA to avoid the need to divest control of the company, but only after selling off all other tradable assets other than personally owned real property. Their remaining liability would still be based on the expansive asset valuation based on voting rights rather than actual ownership, and they would owe 5 percent on any material distributions until tax liability was fully satisfied. Entering into an ODA also subjects taxpayers to California personal jurisdiction indefinitely and binds them to whatever contractual terms and regulatory requirements the state devises for assets attached to the deferral account, which may prove restrictive.

Conclusion

The California Billionaire Wealth Tax ballot initiative, through a mix of intentionally aggressive policy design and potentially inadvertent drafting choices, would impose liability far in excess of 5 percent of net worth for many taxpayers.

Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe. But 5 percent is a profound understatement. The initiative systematically overvalues assets, exacerbating the proposed tax’s economic harm and enhancing the case for outmigration to avoid such an aggressive, economically destructive tax.

The initiative’s drafters sought to forestall an exodus by selecting a January 1, 2026, date for determining residency, but that provision is highly susceptible to legal challenge. Given the many ways that tax liability can far outstrip the advertised 5 percent rate, many billionaires may wish to test the validity of that residency standard if the tax appears poised for passage, depriving the state of jobs, investment, and existing tax revenue from some of the key players in California’s economy.

However, some flat roofs may be better suited to smaller solar canopies that act as elevated shade structures on shared rooftops.

Rooftop canopies come with a whole different set of structural requirements to attach to buildings than ground-mounted carports and canopies. Instead of poured concrete columns for the foundations, solar canopies are typically attached to the parapet walls or structural beams on a roof.

Brooklyn SolarWorks, a PV contractor based in Brooklyn, New York, saw potential for solar canopies in a city where rooftop gathering spaces far outnumber grass lawns. New York City fire codes require a clear 6-ft path both front-to-back and side-to-side on residential buildings for firefighter access; and roof obstructions like hatches and vent pipes minimized sizing potential for roof-mounted solar projects.

“We knew if [a canopy] was 9-ft high it should meet the fire code requirements,” said Gaelen McKee, president and co-founder of Brooklyn SolarWorks. “We engaged with a design studio and an engineer, and we finally got this concept, and we brought it to a fabricator and made a prototype.”

The company iterated on that first solar canopy, making it lighter and faster to install, but still able to withstand the elements on New York City rooftops. Brooklyn SolarWorks was manufacturing aluminum canopy structures for its own projects, but other contractors around the country also wanted to build these arrays. So, Brooklyn SolarWorks started distributing them under the name Brooklyn Solar Canopy Co.

“It finally flipped so that we’re actually selling more canopies third-party than we are using ourselves,” McKee said.

Brooklyn Solar Canopy produces four different types of canopies and carports. Its A-Frame and Post-Truss structures can be installed on the ground or roof.

The A-Frame uses pairs of triangular supports attached at the top to trusses, and guiding rails hold the solar panels. Post-Truss uses upright columns for foundations, and supporting trusses run along the exterior and between column rows, with module-guiding rails atop.

Canopy components can be hoisted or, if there is enough space in the stairwell, carried by hand to the roof.

Installing a solar canopy requires reviewing building blueprints to determine what size rafters are under the roof surface, how far they’re spaced apart and their material. Base tracks on columns are positioned parallel to the top of a masonry/parapet wall or other roof surface so lag bolts can be driven perpendicularly into the rafters, which are often wooden. Attachment points should be spread across different rafters for proper load distribution.

“So, all the point loading is not on the masonry wall, but right inside of it, on the wood,” McKee said. “We will sometimes mount those structures to the actual parapet walls themselves, but because it’s New York, because its building stock is 150 to 200 years old, a lot of that brick is fairly degraded. You’re in a better position to fasten to the wood, just because the brick can be pretty crumbly and uneven.”

In new construction projects where fresh concrete is poured, the canopy can be bolted directly into the concrete wall. Solar States, a residential and commercial PV contractor based in Philadelphia, has made solar canopy projects a regular part of its output, and many of those elevated arrays have been installed on new or recently built homes.

Many Philadelphians add shade structures to town- or rowhouses with roof access — locally known as “roof decks.” Solar States wanted solar canopies as an option for Philly roof decks, but the city initially considered them an “unknown use.” They weren’t traditional rooftop solar or a canopy. They were considered an auxiliary structure and required individual zoning variance with each project.

“If you look around Philadelphia, there’s tons of people that go to Home Depot and buy a backyard patio or pergola and just throw it up on the roof. That’s not permitted,” said Jared Pashko, director of sales and marketing at Solar States. “We need to do everything permitted, and in order to get it permitted, it needs to be structurally stamped.”

The company successfully advocated for a piece of legislation that codified solar canopies for rooftop construction within the city. Every city will have individual quirks for this type of solar project.

When building solar canopies in Philadelphia, Solar States isn’t covering the entire roof. These 5- to 8-kW arrays often occupy about one-third of the space, due to obstructions like stairwell enclosures on roofs.

There’s more material involved in building a solar canopy than a traditional rooftop solar project, but Pashko said the costs are comparable to having a non-PV shade structure built on a roof — except these ones are creating more living space in a home while increasing its property value and saving on energy costs.

“I think that being able to offer that to homeowners is great. Separately, for solar contractors, it opened up a new market segment for us,” he said. “We’re able to install high-profit-margin projects that customers are asking for where there’s not a lot of competition, and that’s a really great thing. It gives us more resources at our disposal to deploy solar and transition to a sustainable economy.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/solar-states-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:10.375203

Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components.
While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool.","The recycling industry, traditionally seen as stable, is in an era of innovation and growth. A class of advanced recycling technologies is emerging to address plastics that conventional recycling methods cannot process, converting materials like mixed film and multilayer packaging into reusable chemical ingredients. While some of the core processes have been around for decades, what’s new is how these technologies are being refined, scaled, and integrated into circular-economy strategies. Modern applications are quickly gaining momentum as brands pursue circularity, states enforce waste-reduction measures, and artificial intelligence-driven efficiencies enhance processing. What started as a promising concept is quickly becoming one of the most closely followed growth stories in the materials sector.

To provide context for this growth, it is notable that Precedence Research recently projected that the advanced recycling market would reach US$7.26 billion by 2035, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.16%.1 Meanwhile, Future Markets, Inc. projected market revenues to exceed US$15 billion by 2040, with CAGRs exceeding 25%.2 Evaluating the broader chemical recycling-service market, Knowledgeable Sourcing Intelligence projected a US$196.2 billion valuation by 2035 based on market growth at a CAGR of 25.8%.3

However, despite these optimistic projections, the industry must contend with opposition from traditional recyclers and environmentalists, as well as with a complicated, ever-changing, and frequently uncertain regulatory landscape characterized by changing definitions, fluctuating state and federal regulations, and continuous discussions about classification and oversight. Successfully managing compliance and innovation depends on effectively navigating this framework. Key challenges to be faced in 2026 are outlined below.

The Clean Air Act: How Should Advanced Recycling Operations Be Regulated?

How advanced recycling operations are regulated under the Clean Air Act (CAA) depends on the technology employed. Currently, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates facilities that combust nonhazardous waste in a starved-air primary chamber and afterburner—such as those using pyrolysis, gasification, or other thermochemical conversion technologies—as solid waste incinerators. These facilities must meet the strict Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) standards outlined in Section 129 of the CAA. This includes adhering to Maximum Achievable Control Technology emission limits for nine specific pollutants, conducting performance tests, continuous emissions monitoring, maintaining operating limits, keeping records, submitting reports, and often obtaining Title V permits.

While facilities complying with the OSWI standards face significant compliance costs and operational challenges, in contrast, facilities that utilize non-combustion-based decomposition methods (such as solvolysis or enzymolysis) or physical purification techniques (like dissolution) are subject to less stringent, category-specific emission standards under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

Notably, this regulatory framework could undergo changes in the near future. Under the Trump administration, the EPA has signaled possible revisions to how pyrolysis and similar units are regulated under the CAA.4 Specifically, in 2021, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to gather feedback on whether to continue classifying pyrolysis units under OSWI rules. Possible outcomes of the ANPRM include maintaining the current standards, streamlining permitting and monitoring requirements, or establishing a new category for advanced recycling with customized standards. A decision not to regulate thermochemical conversion technologies as solid waste incinerators could dramatically reduce compliance costs and accelerate innovation for thermochemical technologies. However, it remains unclear if the EPA will take such action. Environmental groups are opposed, arguing that pyrolysis and gasification units combust waste and emit pollutants similar to traditional incinerators, and that removing pyrolysis units from OSWI classification or creating a separate category with customized standards will weaken air protections.

RCRA: Is Advanced Recycling Waste Disposal or Manufacturing?

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets the federal framework for managing both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. RCRA applies when the material being processed qualifies as “solid waste” under 40 C.F.R. § 261.2 and, if so, whether it is classified as hazardous. A material is considered solid waste if it is discarded—whether abandoned, recycled in certain ways, or inherently waste-like. It becomes hazardous waste if it exhibits hazardous characteristics or appears on the EPA’s hazardous waste lists.

Because advanced recycling typically uses waste plastics as feedstock to produce new materials, these operations often fall within RCRA’s scope. However, states that administer their own waste programs have significant discretion to define what constitutes “waste” and determine whether specific processes are regulated as waste management activities.

If a state concludes that advanced recycling turns discarded plastics into feedstock for new products without creating major disposal concerns, it may classify these operations as manufacturing rather than waste management. This classification can significantly reduce the applicability of RCRA requirements.

Opponents argue that this approach weakens environmental protections by removing stringent waste management standards and creates inconsistencies compared to other recycling operations. According to the opponents, while converting old plastics into new plastic products can reasonably be considered recycling, advanced recycling operations that convert plastic waste into fuels or energy rather than new plastic products is not recycling. They contend that labeling these processes as “recycling” is inconsistent with standards applied to other materials and warn that applying a different standard to plastics risks undermining recycling integrity and environmental protections. Industry advocates counter that converting plastics into fuels or energy should still count as recycling because it recovers value from hard-to-recycle plastics that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. Despite these concerns, since 2017, 25 states have taken this approach to encourage innovation and cut landfill use. They now treat advanced recycling as manufacturing instead of waste disposal. This shift offers big advantages. Facilities labeled as manufacturers often face fewer hazardous waste rules under RCRA. For example, if a recycler converts plastic waste into valuable feedstock—such as a solvolysis plant breaking down PET bottles into monomers—the plastic may not meet the definition of “solid waste” under RCRA Subtitle C. That could exempt the material from RCRA waste management requirements.

A manufacturing designation can also help operators argue that their entire process counts as a single Manufacturing Process Unit. This allows them to manage certain hazardous wastes without triggering strict permitting and tracking rules. It may also help recyclers avoid being classified as a Treatment, Storage, or Disposal Facility, or TSDF, which carries heavy compliance burdens.

Not all states agree. Some explicitly regulate advanced recycling as solid waste management. One state has even banned certain advanced recycling facilities. For this reason, location plays a critical role in determining whether an operation will succeed.

Toxic Substances Control Act: Are Chemical Products Derived From Advanced Plastics Recycling “New Chemicals Substances”?

Like the Clean Air Act and RCRA, advanced recyclers face uncertainty under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The big question is whether chemicals made from recycled plastics are classified as “new chemical substances.” If they do, they must undergo rigorous pre-market review. If not, they’re treated like existing regulated products.

Under TSCA, any chemical not listed on the EPA Inventory is considered new. Before it can be sold, the company must file a Pre-Manufacture Notice (PMN). EPA then reviews the chemical for safety. If data is lacking or risks appear serious, EPA issues a Section 5(e) order. That order can restrict or stop production until more information is provided. Later, EPA often formalizes these limits through Significant New Use Rules (SNURs), which require companies to notify EPA before using the chemical in new ways.

In August 2022, the EPA issued a Section 5(e) Consent Order to a major fuel producer for five PMN substances made from plastic waste. A community group challenged the order in court, citing cancer risks from contaminants. By mid-2023, EPA proposed SNURs for 18 similar substances. These SNURs targeted feedstocks with PFAS, heavy metals, dioxins, BPA, and other toxins. The rules would have required prior notice before using these plastics in advanced recycling or downstream manufacturing, or in fuel applications. However, due to ongoing litigation, the EPA withdrew both the Section 5(e) Consent Order and the proposed SNURs. That move left the industry in limbo. Future SNURs could reshape compliance obligations for recyclers, refiners, and manufacturers.

The Trump administration has indicated it plans to require impurity testing for new chemicals from waste plastics on a case-by-case basis. So far, that has not happened. Many PMNs remain pending. Companies do not know what rules will apply. Manufacturers, importers, and businesses in biotech, advanced materials, and consumer products need to stay alert. EPA’s next steps could change the game.

The Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act (CWA) governs pollutant discharges into US waters, and advanced recycling facilities, particularly those using chemical processes, are subject to its requirements. Operations that discharge process water or wastewater must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which sets limits on pollutants and requires monitoring and reporting. Facilities also need to manage stormwater runoff from feedstock storage and chemical handling to prevent contamination during rain events or spills.

Environmental groups are calling for stronger water protections, arguing that current CWA standards do not adequately address chemical contaminants associated with advanced recycling processes, including PFAS, heavy metals, and dioxins. They urge the EPA to update effluent guidelines and to require comprehensive monitoring and reporting for wastewater and stormwater discharges. Advocates also emphasize the need for advanced treatment technologies to ensure hazardous substances are removed before water is released into the environment. In their view, exemptions or relaxed standards would undermine public health and environmental integrity, making robust oversight essential. Additional concerns include stormwater runoff from feedstock storage, accidental spills, and thermal pollution from process water—issues critics believe demand stringent monitoring, treatment standards, and transparent reporting to prevent contamination of surface and groundwater.

How Might Federal Legislative Proposals Impact Advanced Recycling

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing initiatives to boost recycling and clarify rules for advanced recycling. One proposal, the Accelerating a Circular Economy for Plastics and Recycling Innovation Act, would set national standards for plastics recycling. It calls for plastic packaging to include at least 30% recycled content by 2030 and defines advanced recycling as a manufacturing process, not waste disposal. If passed, this would standardize definitions and reduce regulatory uncertainty.

Another bill, the Cultivating Investment in Recycling and Circular Local Economies (CIRCLE) Act, takes a financial approach. It offers a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure, including advanced recycling facilities. This could lower capital costs and speed up adoption of advanced recycling technologies, making them more competitive.

Together, these legislative changes—harmonized federal standards and new financial incentives—could open doors for growth and reshape compliance strategies, investment plans, and market positioning.

Extended Producer Responsibility: How Extended Producer Responsibility Laws Are Affecting Advanced Recycling

States are taking bold steps on waste management, with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws leading the way. By late 2025, California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington had rolled out EPR programs for packaging. These laws make producers responsible for post-consumer packaging and link costs to recyclability and environmental impact, thereby pushing investment into technology that tackles hard-to-recycle plastics. Advanced recycling is emerging as a game-changing solution. It turns materials traditional recycling rejects into valuable components, helping producers hit sustainability targets, and cut fees under certain regulations.

Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components. This not only helps producers achieve sustainability goals but also reduces fees under certain environmental regulations.

California’s SB 54, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, exemplifies this trend. By 2032, all regulated packaging must be recyclable or compostable, plastic use must decline by 25%, and recycling rates must reach 65%. While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool. Proposed regulations would allow producers to leverage advanced recycling to meet reduction and recyclability goals without completely redesigning packaging. Still, companies must navigate federal rules under RCRA and TSCA, since chemical recycling feedstocks can trigger hazardous waste or new substance reviews.

To succeed, businesses need a proactive strategy—partnering on advanced recycling, tracking lifecycle impacts, and staying on top of regulations.

Conclusion

Advanced recycling has huge growth potential. But in 2026, success depends on agility.

That move came after the city’s first large scale response tied to an electric vehicle. The Chattanooga Fire Department says a fire broke out at an apartment complex in the early morning hours of Nov. 22, 2024. Fire officials ruled the fire an accident and traced it to an electric vehicle charging in the parking garage.

After that fire, the condominium complex moved to stop electric vehicle charging.

Some residents later sued, arguing the complex overreached.

We are now hearing from a former HOA president who says the conversation around electric vehicles started years earlier.

“At some point during the four years I was president of the HOA, we had a handful, very small handful, and there's still a small handful of EV owners, they requested the ability to plug into some existing electrical outlets in the garage,” said Buck Tasker, a One North Shore resident and former HOA president.

Tasker says those electric vehicle owners were allowed to charge in the garage at the time.

A lawsuit filed against the current HOA board says that changed in July 2025.

Tasker says discussions about electric vehicles and how to handle them happened while he served as HOA president, but intensified after the 2024 fire at a nearby garage on Frazier Avenue.

The fire at 417 Frazier Avenue in 2024 burned for more than an hour and destroyed or damaged dozens of vehicles.

Tasker says the board noticed power issues in the aftermath of that fire.

“Some of those EV chargers were tripping those breakers and causing the fire alarm to go off because they were drawing too much power,” Tasker said. “The building has no infrastructure for EV charging when it was built in 2008.”

Attorney Herbert Thornbury lives at 417 Frazier Avenue, where the 2024 fire happened. He is not involved in the current lawsuit, but says the fire left a lasting impact.

“This fire just raged for how long, hour and 20 minutes. They couldn’t put it out,” Thornbury said.

He says four of his vehicles were lost, and nearly 20 cars in total were destroyed or heavily damaged.

“19 cars down here, they were all totaled, smoke damage,” Thornbury said.

Thornbury says it is difficult to predict how the lawsuit will play out.

“The litigation is incredibly complicated, you can imagine, you know, to get an expert to figure out where the fire started,” he said. He added, “I don't think that the lawsuit's going anywhere.”

There is good news from Carbon Brief this week. It reports that the use of coal to generate electricity fell in both China and India in 2025 — the first time that has happened simultaneously in both countries in more than fifty years. It says electricity generation from coal in India fell by 3% year-on-year (57 TWh) and in China by 1.6% (58TWh).

The decrease in coal-powered thermal generation coincides with an increase in renewable energy last year. That increase was more than enough to meet rising demand for electricity in both countries. “Both countries now have the preconditions in place for peaking coal fired power, if China is able to sustain clean energy growth and India meets its renewable energy targets,” Carbon Brief says.

“These shifts have international implications, as the power sectors of these two countries drove 93 percent of the rise in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2015 to 2024. Challenges remain, but the decline in coal power output in both countries “marks an historic moment, which could help lead to a peak in global emissions,” according to Carbon Brief.

Maybe. The energy mix in any country is the result of a number of factors. Hydropower goes up when reservoirs are full but declines when water levels decline. Weather is a major factor, as colder temperatures increase the need to heat buildings, while hotter temperatures drive up the demand for cooling.

In China, demand for electricity increased by 5% in 2025, but it was more than offset by the increase in renewables, particularly solar. But there are recent policy changes in China that could impact its ability to supply the super cheap solar panels that have transformed how electricity is used in much of Africa and in Pakistan.

Policy Changes

According to The Energy Mix, last year China removed a policy that gave solar panel manufacturers a guaranteed rate of return. Export incentives have also been reduced or eliminated. Those regulatory changes have caused many observers, including the International Energy Agency, to predict there will be less solar power to be installed in 2026, even if the decrease is modest. But once the industry adapts to the new regulatory environment, the IEA expects solar installations to tick upwards again in 2027.

While an increase in the availability of renewable energy in China and India has suppressed the demand for coal power, locking in future declines in coal generation will depend on meeting a series of challenges. First, power grids will need to be operated more flexibly to accommodate the increasing amount of renewable energy available. That means updating old power market structures that were built to serve coal-fired generating stations in China and India.

Both countries have continued to add new coal-fired power capacity. If the number of coal-powered generating stations under construction and permitted are completed, they would increase coal power capacity by 28% in China and 23% in India.

The necessary result of bringing more coal power online will be a decrease in the utilization rates of those facilities, which will drive up the cost of operating them and lead to higher costs for grid supplied electricity. In the longer term, new coal capacity would have to be slowed substantially while retirements are accelerated in order to make space for further expansion of clean energy in the power systems of the two countries.

Carbon Brief says power generation in China and India were responsible for more than 90% of the increase in global CO2 emissions from all sources between 2015 and 2024, with 78% attributable to China and 16% to India. Therefore, reducing emissions from their electricity generating sectors is the key to lowering global emissions.

US Emissions Rise

In marked contrasts to the good news from China and India, the latest report from the Rhodium Group claims that greenhouse gas emissions in the US rose 2.4% last year. “The increase in emissions was driven primarily by the buildings and power sectors. Colder winter temperatures drove higher space heating demand in buildings, pushing up direct emissions from fuel use in buildings by 6.8 percent. Higher natural gas prices and growing power demand boosted coal electricity generation, resulting in a 3.8 percent rise in power sector emissions,” the report said.

“The increase in 2025 emissions was driven by increases of 6.8 percent in the buildings sector and 3.8 percent in the power sector. Transportation remained the highest-emitting sector, though emissions rose only slightly by 0.1 percent from 2024 levels. Emissions rose more modestly in the industrial and oil & gas sectors.”

Data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and other large load customers drove electricity demand up by 2.4%, with most of the increase occurring in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Ohio Valley regions. Electricity to charge battery-powered vehicles was also a factor in the increased demand.

The main driver of higher coal use, the Rhodium Group says, was higher natural gas prices, which were up 58% at Henry Hub in 2025 compared to the very low prices recorded in 2024. An increase in the export of liquefied natural gas drove up methane prices substantially, as the current administration’s all out attempt to make the US great again leaves more and more people in America worse off financially.

Simple Economics

A first year business school student would know that when supplies go down, prices go up, but apparently the Moron of Mar-A-Loco was absent that week — or that year, as the case may be. Because of the wrong-headed policies of the US administration, fewer coal-fired generating stations were retired last year than in 2024. Through November, only 2.5 GW of conventional steam coal capacity was retired, compared with 4.5 GW in 2024 and an average of nearly 9 GW a year since 2020.

The fastest growing power generation source in 2025 was solar, which surged by 34%, the report said. That is the highest growth rate since 2017 and pushed the grid share of zero-emitting sources up by one percentage point to 42%, despite only a modest increase in wind and flat nuclear and hydroelectric generation. Natural gas remained the single largest source of electricity, though it fell by nearly three percentage points to 40% of the grid mix.

The US Emissions Picture Has Changed

In this year’s report, the Rhodium Group has lowered its projections for future decreases in US emissions since 2005 from 38 to 56% by 2035 to 26 to 35%. “This slowdown is largely due to changes to energy tax credits made by the 119th Congress in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill and the repeal of climate regulations by the Trump administration,” it said in its latest report.

“Apart from some modest contributions to increased coal generation from Department of Energy orders to keep a few plants running, we aren’t yet seeing the direct effects of these policy changes in US emissions. That could change in the coming year or two, particularly if data center electricity demand continues to surge and the grid responds with more output from existing fossil generators instead of new, clean resources. The growth in electric vehicles, which has in part helped keep a lid on transportation sector emissions, may also stall in the absence of federal tax credits and regulatory policies.”

Bury The Data

“Beyond policy changes that will result in higher emissions, the Trump administration has also moved to stop collecting and reporting a multitude of data on GHG emissions and climate change. Two of these data products in particular — the EPA’s annual GHG inventory and its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for major emitting facilities — are integral inputs to our work,” the Rhodium report says.

“Typically, we would expect EPA to give the US its final GHG report card for 2025 in spring 2027. However, EPA only released the 2023 inventory earlier this year when compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request, and most of the work had already been completed under the Biden administration. Given the Trump administration’s hostility to collecting and reporting data related to climate change, we may not receive any further inventories under this administration.” [Emphasis added.]

“The loss of this data means we are heading into murkier waters when it comes to understanding the second-largest emitter of GHGs in the world. While US emissions rose, 2025 was the second or third hottest year on record across the globe. Because emissions and their impacts persist even when the government does not count them, we will continue to adapt to this new landscape in order to inform critical US energy and climate policy debates.”

Translation: This assemblage of sycophants who have all pledged allegiance to a known liar, fraudster, pussy grabber, admirer of underage girls, and convicted sexual abuser are working full time to reward campaign donors while telling Americans to breathe dirtier air, drink dirtier water, drive dirtier cars, pay more for health insurance, and struggle to make ends meet. Yet over 70 million mostly white Americans who style themselves as devoted Christians voted to put this fat buffoon in office.

Making America Irrelevant

Whether America will ever be great again will depend on people coming to the senses. Based on the observable evidence, that is not likely to happen anytime soon. People in positions of power delight in pushing others down because they view equality as a form of punishment.

Until we fix that misconception, America will never be more than an afterthought, an historical anomaly like Carthage or Rome — entities that enjoyed a period in the sun and then became irrelevant. The blather and bluster emanating from the White Man’s House today is reminiscent of this soliloquy from the Shakespeare play Macbeth.

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,

To the last syllable of recorded time;

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,

And then is heard no more. It is a tale

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

Signifying nothing.

The agency will still assess health impacts but only weigh industry compliance costs in monetary terms.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has changed how it evaluates air pollution regulations, opting to stop assigning a monetary value to human health benefits when setting certain clean air rules, according to a New York Times report.

The updated approach applies to regulations governing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone. Both pollutants are widely regulated due to their documented impacts on human health. The change appeared in a preliminary version of a new power plant emissions rule posted on the EPA’s website late last week.

Under the revised framework, the agency will continue to evaluate industry compliance costs but will no longer calculate the dollar value of avoided deaths or illnesses associated with reductions in PM2.5 and ozone. The EPA said previous efforts to monetize these health benefits relied on estimates that were too uncertain.

The agency stated it will continue to consider the health impacts of these pollutants but will not assign a specific monetary value. EPA officials said emissions will continue to be quantified while the agency works to improve its modeling before monetizing those impacts again.

This marks a significant shift from longstanding EPA practice, which typically compared regulatory compliance costs with estimated economic benefits associated with improved health outcomes. The agency detailed its rationale within the power plant rule, noting that declining emissions and evolving science have made impact estimates less precise.

The move has drawn attention because cost-benefit analyses play a central role in shaping federal environmental regulations. Industry groups have previously criticized the EPA’s methods for calculating health benefits, arguing they overstated gains and underestimated uncertainty.

The policy shift is part of a broader set of environmental actions taken under the Trump administration. In recent weeks, the administration has withdrawn the United States from several international climate-focused organizations and signaled plans to revise federal authority over greenhouse gas regulations.

The EPA’s new approach may face legal scrutiny. Courts have historically required agencies to weigh both costs and benefits when issuing regulations. Any challenges would likely focus on whether the revised framework meets established administrative standards.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026-EPA-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 20:59:27.616461

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman.
Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.
In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy.
He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored.","For James Hiatt, the 43 year old founder and director of For a Better Bayou, a nonprofit seeking to foster alternatives to the fossil fuel economy in Southwestern Louisiana, the oil and gas industry isn’t just in his blood; it’s in his nostrils.

“My dad worked at Conoco, now Phillips 66. He’d come home in his Nomex [fire retardant garments] smelling like the refinery after 12-hour shifts,” Hiatt said. “He missed a lot of family stuff. I told myself I was never going to work in the refinery.”

Instead, he got married at 19 and moved in 2002 with his wife to New York City, a young couple with a plan: she’d teach school while earning a master’s degree, and he’d pursue rock star dreams and get a day job to help pay the bills.

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman. His previous worldview — conservative, Christian, conformist — was exploded by the diversity. The owner, a Holocaust survivor, had a number tattooed on his arm by the Nazis; the bellman fasted for the entire month of Ramadan while hauling luggage up three or four flights without a sip of water. Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.

“I started recycling. I stopped buying things made by exploited foreign labor just because they were cheaper. The belief structure I’d been given told me that everybody’s burning in hell unless you save them, unless you convince them to believe the way you believe. And that didn’t work for me anymore,” he said.

In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy. Returning home to raise him (and later two daughters) among family (who were mostly working in refineries), Hiatt soon got a job at Citgo, a Venezuelan oil company in Lake Charles. He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored. When a better paying opportunity came his way in the refinery’s lab, he went for it.

His wallet fattened, but it came at a price. “Like my dad, I was really grouchy working those 12-hour shifts. My poor wife and kids. You know, you only sleep a couple hours, and you’re up to try to do something, and then you’re in a bad mood,” he said.

Those “bad moods” eventually led Hiatt to a 12-step program. Now ten years sober, his personal transformation feeds his professional commitments: if individuals can be released from the grip of self-obliterating addictions, societies can, too. And he set to work to help make it so, first as a campaigner in a nonprofit focused on halting the liquid natural gas (LNG) expansion in the area, and since 2023, at the helm of For A Better Bayou, which more broadly seeks to protect the health, livelihoods, and cultural heritage of Southwest Louisiana amid expanding industrial pollution and accelerating climate impacts. Funding comes from individual donations and through foundation support.

The focus is on opposing harmful fossil fuel infrastructure, while supporting fisherfolk and frontline communities, nurturing community empowerment, advancing coastal restoration and climate resilience efforts, and building pathways toward a just economic transition rooted in local knowledge and stewardship. Hiatt shoulders that work with one paid staff member.

When not meeting with local residents and workers, their days, and not uncommonly evenings and weekends, are spent documenting environmental harms, reviewing permits and regulatory filings, engaging with local, state, and federal agencies, and building coalitions with partner organizations to advance community-led solutions.

“I tell folks, pick whatever lights you up, whatever pisses you off. Is it the LNG buildouts, the data centers, carbon capture? Pick one, and let’s work on that,” he explained.

Hiatt’s ties with big oil weren’t severed in a golden moment of epiphany and grace. He was pushed out — fired in the midst of workplace drama that his union successfully resolved on his behalf, resulting in a payout he used for tuition to retool. He earned a psychology degree while hustling in the gig economy for Grub Hub and Door Dash.

“I was aiming to be a social worker because I love the ability to help people (myself included) stretch beyond the patterns and behaviors we can’t always see that cause the issues — like the externalized costs that are never, ever attributed to these refineries.”",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/the-shift-superfund-site-gate.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:00:18.922198

It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.
But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.
Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders.
“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book.","In the 19th century, the young United States grew in leaps and bounds.

First there was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, in which Thomas Jefferson bought from the French a chunk of what is now America’s Midwest, West and South.

Next was the Mexican Cession, in 1848. As part of a peace deal after the Mexican-American war, Mexico handed over territory including what is now California, Nevada and other states.

And then there was the Alaska Purchase, from the Russians, in 1867, which at the time was derided as an icebox and too expensive.

But if President Trump gets his way and, as he has insisted, takes over Greenland “whether they like it or not,” it would be bigger than any of those, according to the National Archives, the U.S. census and the C.I.A. World Factbook. At 836,000 square miles, Greenland is bigger than France, Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany — combined. It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.

Mr. Trump has based his fixation on Greenland, which has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years, on reasons of “national security,” citing threats from Russia and China. But he made a past remark about Greenland’s size, and scholars say the territorial grandeur itself is at least part of what appeals to him.

“Trump’s a real estate guy,” David Silbey, a historian at Cornell University, said in an email, “and the idea of grabbing that much land seems to me his particular guiding force: THE MOST LAND EVER.”

He added that Mr. Trump “likes to pick on targets that are too weak to fight back, which certainly describes Denmark,” he added.

This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is meeting to discuss the future of Greenland with Danish and Greenlandic officials, both of whom say that the island, the world’s largest, is not for sale.

But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.

In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said the best way for the United States to handle Greenland would be to own it because ownership is “psychologically needed for success.”

Mr. Trump has dismissed the importance of a longstanding American-Danish defense pact that already guarantees the U.S. broad military access in Greenland. During World War II and the Cold War, the United States had thousands of troops and more than a dozen bases on the island; now it has just one.

Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders. He cited Mr. Trump’s insistence on taking back the Panama Canal, his repeated comments that Canada could become America’s 51st state, his talk last year of taking over Gaza and his fixation on Greenland.

“It’s clear that Trump is bent on territorial annexation in a way that presidents in past decades have not been,” Dr. Immerwahr said. “Trump’s annexationist ambition echoes those of presidents in the distant past — Polk, Teddy Roosevelt — but no one in the post-1945 period.”

Greenland’s size was indeed part of Mr. Trump’s thinking, according to “The Divider,” a book about the first Trump administration written by Peter Baker, a White House correspondent for The Times, and Susan Glasser, a staff writer for The New Yorker.

“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book. “And I always said: ‘Look at the size of this. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.’’’

American officials floated the idea of buying Greenland in 1867 and 1946, but it never materialized.

Greenlanders find the whole idea insulting. Even if the United States were to offer each of Greenland’s 57,000 residents a million dollars, Greenlanders wouldn’t take it, said Aqqaluk Lynge, a former member of Greenland’s Parliament.

“We don’t sell our souls,” he said.

The resources were first announced in a with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9) and leaders from the United Steelworkers and United Auto Workers.

A recording of the briefing can be found on the BlueGreen Alliance YouTube Channel.

“Today, I was proud to join leaders from the BlueGreen Alliance, United Auto Workers, and United Steelworkers to draw attention to the cancellation of $11 billion in Department of Energy projects across the country, including over $100 million of cancellations for companies in the Northwest Ohio district I represent alone,” said Rep. Kaptur. “These awards were authorized by Congress, and the funds were appropriated. Then the Department of Energy approved them, announced them, and signed contracts with the recipients. But under the Trump administration, they have now been revoked! These project terminations are a matter of real consequence for hardworking American families across our nation, for our global competitiveness, and for the communities I represent across Northwest Ohio.”

During 2025, several administrative and congressional actions cut federal funding to advanced manufacturing projects and the clean tech industry. Notably, in July, Trump signed the GOP budget bill repealing nearly $550 billion in funding that would have supported good union jobs, clean energy, and manufacturing investments.

“More than 410,000 workers are currently building clean vehicles and components in this country,” said David Green, Director, United Auto Workers Region 2B. “In recent months, we’ve seen a number of these workers laid off, including over a thousand employees at GM’s Factory Zero and another thousand plus employees at Ultium Cells in the Lordstown area.

“To see those workers bear the brunt of short-sighted corporate and political wavering is infuriating.”

In addition to that repealed funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has canceled hundreds of contracted awards worth $11 billion for domestic manufacturing, innovation, and decarbonization projects, including over $100 million in awarded federal investments in Ohio’s 9th district. The new data dashboard unveiled today tracks where these canceled or at-risk projects are located across the country, the lost DOE funding, details any community benefits plans attached to the awards, and tallies associated private investment and potential job loss.

“These projects weren’t just about technology—they were about people,” said Roy Houseman, Legislative Director and Assistant to the President, United Steelworkers (USW). “The Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022 with the support of USW and other unions to create jobs and strengthen U.S. competitiveness. By late 2024, it had already helped create 150,000 jobs, with projections of 13.7 million jobs and $1.9 trillion in economic growth. The DOE cuts undermine that progress.”

“Canceling projects for political reasons unrelated to their merit doesn’t just halt funding it kills jobs, undermines U.S. competitiveness, and erodes trust in public-private partnerships,” said Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance. “Congress must defend its constitutional authority, restore funding for canceled projects, and recommit to a long-term industrial strategy. DOE should reverse course and partner with industry to keep America in the driver’s seat of the clean energy economy. Anything less risks locking the United States into dependence on foreign supply chains.”",,N,,2026-01-15 01:58:44.465448

This year, we are setting a new standard for the nation.

Louisiana NOW represents a new era of competitiveness grounded in execution. We are no longer preparing to win. We are winning—at a level that positions Louisiana among the nation’s most competitive environments for business investment, job creation and long-term opportunity.

Louisiana entered 2026 with undeniable momentum, driven by two years of focused work transforming the state’s economic development system. That effort strengthened competitiveness, aligned public and private partners and modernized how the state supports growth.

The results of these efforts arrived faster than anyone expected and reshaped how Louisiana competes on a national and global stage.

For the second consecutive year, Louisiana earned Business Facilities’ Platinum Deal of the Year, becoming the first state to secure back-to-back top honors. This distinction reflects more than a single project. It signals growing confidence among global companies evaluating where to invest, expand and build long-term operations.

These projects span industries, operate on a larger scale and require seamless coordination across state, regional and local partners— as well as a workforce system prepared to meet industry demand.

That level of complexity demands consistency, and Louisiana is delivering.

The state has changed how it moves projects from planning to execution. Earlier coordination across site readiness, infrastructure, and workforce preparation is reducing uncertainty and enabling companies to grow, expand and invest with confidence while creating opportunity and supporting wage growth here at home.

In the new year, Louisiana does not simply reflect on this success. We are setting the tone for what comes next and showing the world that this growth is structural, not temporary.

National benchmarks reinforce that position. Louisiana ranks among the leading states for cost competitiveness, workforce preparation and overall affordability:

#9 Top State for Doing Business, Area Development

#10 Corporate Tax Competitiveness, Tax Foundation

#2 Workforce Training Program, Business Facilities

#5 Lowest Cost of Living, U.S. News and World Report

#7 Cost of Doing Business, CNBC

Together, these measures reflect a foundation built for sustained growth across industries and regions, from advanced manufacturing and energy to technology and emerging sectors.

In 2026, Louisiana is raising the bar again. The work ahead builds on record momentum and reflects one clear direction for the state and its partners.",https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LinkedIn-Article-Cover.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:00:23.225631

In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational.
The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.
And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher.","There is a glimmer of hope for the long embattled offshore wind industry.

One project in Massachusetts has been sending power back to the grid for months, even as the Trump administration suspended offshore wind farm construction in December. And this week, another nearly complete project off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island got the green light from a federal judge to continue building.

Monday’s ruling allowing Revolution Wind to resume construction was the first in a series of court cases that businesses and states are bringing over the course of this week, challenging the administration’s December suspension of all five offshore wind projects currently under construction in the Atlantic Ocean.

It’s a big win for power-starved New England, whose regional grid operator says it needs the electrons generated by these wind projects to maintain electricity reliability in the region for years to come.

President Donald Trump, however, continues to double down on his distaste for offshore wind.

“My goal is to not let any windmill be built; they’re losers,” Trump said on Friday, during a meeting with oil CEOs. “We don’t approve, and I told my people, we will not approve windmills.”

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Monday’s ruling.

Trump’s stance has resulted in the administration blocking projects that are nearly finished. In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete. Construction had already been stopped once before by the administration, in August.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational. That project has been allowed to send power to the grid even amid Trump’s suspension, a spokesperson for regional grid operator ISO-New England told CNN in an email.

Offshore wind has long been sought by New England and mid-Atlantic states, which rely mostly on natural gas for electricity and heating — and are lacking other ready energy infrastructure. At Monday’s court hearing, representatives for Revolution Wind said their wind farm was the only project of such size ready to come online and start providing power to New England’s grid soon. It’s ultimately expected to generate enough electricity to power upwards of 350,000 homes. When complete, the slightly smaller Vineyard Wind project is expected to power around 200,000 homes.

The largest wind farm impacted by the December order is a sprawling Virginia project that could eventually be the largest in the nation. Set to be completed by the end of this year, it would supply electricity to the region with the world’s largest cluster of power-hungry data centers.

Residential customers in the mid-Atlantic region, including Virginia, desperately need more energy to service the skyrocketing demand from data centers — and many are seeing spiking energy bills while they wait for new power to be brought online. In a notable move, that region’s grid operator PJM Interconnection joined a lawsuit on behalf of the Virginia project, calling its 2.7 gigawatts an “integral component” of electricity generation in the region.

“Extended delay of construction and operation of the CVOW [Virginia] project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million Americans served by PJM,” PJM wrote in a legal brief.

The Revolution and Vineyard wind farms are “particularly important” to meeting New England’s winter energy needs, energy experts and the regional grid operator ISO-NE say. In a December statement, ISO-NE said the projects were important to maintaining “system reliability in the winter when offshore wind output is highest and other forms of fuel supply are constrained.”

“Canceling or delaying these projects will increase costs and risks to reliability in our region,” the regional grid operator added in a statement.

New England’s winter energy woes are driven both by temperature and the fact that this region is the last stop on the nation’s natural gas pipeline system. Competing needs for electricity and home heating can send energy prices for consumers surging.

“The colder it gets on a given day, the more demands that are placed on the gas pipeline system, not just to generate electric power, but to heat people’s homes,” said Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, a clean energy industry association based in New England. “If there’s less demand for something, you’ll lower the price.”

There’s another way offshore wind will have downward pressure on prices, Pullaro said. The regional grid operator typically directs the cheapest units to run first, which means wind — which carries no cost for fuel — will be called on more, as more facilities get up and running.

Wind and solar “have very little marginal cost; they essentially bid zero,” Pullaro said. “The more wind you have on the system, and when it’s running at these peak times, it essentially means you’re not having to turn on that peaker gas or oil unit, because it’s just not needed.”

Pullaro’s organization commissioned a recent study that found that having 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind on New England’s grid last winter would have resulted in New England utility Eversource’s residential customers saving between $15.83 - $32.13 total in electric bills over the course of a three-month winter period.

However, if Revolution and Vineyard wind are both built, they will add less than half of that amount of wind energy to the grid, and there’s no publicly available data yet to show how offshore wind has impacted electricity prices in the region this winter.

Trump administration officials have frequently claimed that offshore wind is the most expensive form of energy. On Monday, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum repeated that, calling the form of energy “some of the most expensive projects ever conceived.”

Offshore wind projects do have high initial costs, in large part because the limited supply chains and high inflation rates that have dogged the US economy affect construction. But, once built, projects like Vineyard are in such demand that they will begin operation with the electricity they generate already spoken for — and paid for. The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.

And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher. Without Revolution Wind, consumers in Connecticut could pay a lot more for energy during times of high demand — as much as $200 million annually starting next year, the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection estimated in a recent report.

This week, massive wind turbine blades, towers and other components could be seen sitting at the Connecticut State Pier in New London — waiting to be taken out to sea and constructed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-ap25356646674574.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 19:58:53.605985

There is a disconnect between rapid deployment and workforce development in the energy market, says Francesco La Camera, Director General, IRENA. He stresses that governments need to align trade, industrial and labor policies to support domestic capacity and skills development, while strengthening international cooperation to help countries lagging in the energy transition. Such efforts, he says, are critical to meeting the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030 and ensuring broader socio-economic benefits.

Green jobs are highly beneficial for both the environment and society as a whole, says Rodrigo Osorio, Director General, Energy Agency of Puebla. “To be considered green, a job must meet high standards that are required to enhance the life conditions of workers,” he says. “Employees with green jobs must have their voice heard at work, equality must be ensured, everyone must receive a fair income for what they do and the conditions at work must be safe and dignifying. It is imperative to push the social agenda together with the environment to be able to move forward without leaving anyone behind.”

The joint Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2025 report found that jobs in the sector increased by 2.3% from 2023, bringing total employment to 16.6 million worldwide. The report points to geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, along with increasing automation across supply chains, as factors shaping labor dynamics in the energy transition.

Beyond employment totals, the report places a strong emphasis on inclusion and equity. It argues that a just transition requires deliberate action to address the underrepresentation of women and people with disabilities in the renewable energy workforce. According to the study, existing barriers continue to limit participation despite growing labor demand across technologies.

Disability inclusion must be embedded in renewable energy policies from design to implementation, says Gilbert Houngbo, Director General, ILO. He calls for accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate diverse needs, noting that inclusion is essential for resilient labor markets and sustainable development.

The analysis highlights persistent regional imbalances. China maintained its position as the dominant player in renewable energy employment, reflecting its large-scale, integrated manufacturing and deployment capacity. In 2024, China accounted for an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, representing 44% of the global total.

Employment levels in other major markets showed more modest changes. The European Union held steady at 1.8 million jobs, unchanged from the previous year. Brazil reported 1.4 million renewable energy jobs, while India and the United States saw limited growth, reaching about 1.3 million and 1.1 million jobs, respectively.

Inclusive policy frameworks, supported by accessible education, labor market services and stakeholder engagement, are needed to ensure that the energy transition delivers economic opportunities more evenly.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg?h=a81debc8&itok=v-NIbbyK,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:46.039555

Equinor faces project termination if not resumed by January 16

Jan 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge will rule on Thursday on whether to allow Norwegian offshore wind developer Equinor to resume construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's suspension of the industry.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington had declined to issue an immediate ruling at a hearing on Wednesday, two days after the same court ruled Danish offshore wind developer Orsted (ORSTED.CO), opens new tab could restart work on its nearly completed Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.

The telephonic hearing will take place at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) local time, according to the court.

The court decisions in these cases hold high stakes for companies and their shareholders because they could allow multi-billion-dollar projects to be completed, but the underlying lawsuits and the administration's aversion to offshore wind will continue to create uncertainty.

FIVE PROJECTS PAUSED

Equinor's request for an injunction, which would allow work to continue while the lawsuit proceeds, is the latest in a string of legal challenges to U.S. President Donald Trump's all-of-government opposition to the offshore wind sector.

Trump's Interior Department last month paused activity on five offshore wind leases, citing new classified information on risks to national security from radar interference.

During the hour-long hearing, Empire Wind attorney Ann Navaro said the pause created an ""existential risk"" for the company, and that it could lose access to construction vessels it needs to complete the $5.5 billion project.

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Stanley Woodward, arguing for the administration, said national security concerns justified the halt and argued the ""parade of horribles"" Empire Wind said would result from the pause was ""speculative.""

Nichols questioned whether the government's national security concerns would apply during construction of the project as opposed to during operations. Empire Wind said the project is not slated to start operations until October.

The judge, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, also raised the possibility of temporarily halting the pause before ruling on the merits of the case in an expedited proceeding.

Equinor (EQNR.OL), opens new tab has spent $4 billion on its project, and said in court papers that it faces likely termination if it cannot proceed by January 16.

Empire Wind is located 20 miles (32 km) off the coast of Long Island and is about 60% complete. It is expected to produce electricity to power about 500,000 homes.

Offshore wind developers, including Equinor, have faced repeated disruptions under Trump, who says wind turbines are ugly, expensive and inefficient. Empire Wind was halted previously by the administration for a month last year.

The affordability crisis is widespread, and energy costs in particular have become a fast-growing problem.
One factor is rising energy demand.
But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid.
And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis.","Pennsylvania is welcoming the new year with an old problem: while temperatures have hovered around single digits in some counties, energy costs are too high for many people to afford.

The impact is huge: 1 in 5 Pennsylvanians had trouble paying their utility bills last year, and shutoffs are up 38%. Every day, my neighbors in South Philly stop by our district office asking for help keeping their heat on. The alternatives are turning on their oven, skipping medication to afford to pay their bills, or simply doing without heat in the freezing cold.

Warmth in the winter is not a luxury; everyone should be able to live comfortably through the coldest months. But so many people are working so much – multiple jobs, overnight shifts, on weekends – and still can’t get ahead. For poor and working people, the struggle to keep up with a mountain of bills is nothing new; between utilities, groceries, student debt, medical debt and housing, the bills have kept growing and wages have failed to keep up. The affordability crisis is widespread, and energy costs in particular have become a fast-growing problem.

So why is this happening? And more importantly, what can we do to keep costs down and the heat on for everyone?

One factor is rising energy demand. Due to immense growth in digital technologies – artificial intelligence, cloud devices, crypto mining – demand is outpacing supply. In response, Big Tech corporations are rapidly building out data centers. Increased air conditioning use due to climate change and the electrification of fossil fuel-based industries also contributes to the strain on the grid.

Second, not enough generation is coming online quickly enough to meet this increased demand. We know wind and solar projects are the cheapest and fastest energy sources to build. But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid. 90% of those projects are clean energy sources that could lower costs for ratepayers. And last year, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered the surest path to jumpstarting clean energy investments in the U.S. As a result, shovel-ready renewable energy projects have been scrapped, and programs that saved consumers money on their energy bills, like Solar for All, were illegally halted.

All of this together feels like a challenge nearly too big to tackle. We have no choice but to try to do just that if we’re going to avoid the worst predictions of energy shortages. Blackouts and brownouts will cost people their livelihoods and, in some cases, their lives as temperatures soar (or plummet) and they are unable to turn on their air conditioning (or heat). People will die.

We know that generating more clean power is both the fastest and cheapest way to get more energy on the grid.

That can be done through legislation to install more solar on large warehouse roofs, open the door to new geothermal and nuclear investments, and promote battery storage to make these energy sources even more reliable 24/7. And we must find a way to make our membership in PJM work better for Pennsylvanians: According to a new report, the average Pennsylvania household would save $505 a year if PJM connected more clean energy to the grid.

Hardworking parents and families shouldn’t have to foot the bill for data center development driven by major corporations, especially during a nationwide affordability crisis. That’s why we’re advancing my colleague Rep. Rob Matzie’s bill, House Bill 1834, which ensures that costs from data centers, like upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure, won’t be passed on to ratepayers. Hardworking parents and seniors are already having a hard time paying the bills; they shouldn’t be expected to pay even more.

As chair of the House Energy Committee, I’m also interested in ways we can directly reduce costs by improving the efficiency of the grid (including by adopting demand response measures, advanced transmission technologies; and virtual power plants, which would allow customers to enroll power cells like sustainable batteries and EV chargers into a program that supplies energy to the grid during peak demand) and by updating energy efficiency standards so we all use less energy in the first place.

Our neighbors are counting on these reforms. And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis. That crisis will be felt by working people and families as overdue bills pile up, blackouts and brownouts become a reality, and people risk their lives in the cold.

It’s incumbent upon us, as lawmakers, to lead with a new vision for the future – one where everyone has heat, power, and time to spend with their loved ones. In the richest country in the history of the world, we can do better. And in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we must.",https://cdn.cityandstatepa.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/14/GettyImages_2201915274_headline/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:58:56.857952

The partners will use $3 million in REPI funds, along with $4.3 million in partner contributions, to treat 2,000 acres of National Forest System land and nonfederal lands near the U.S. Air Force Academy and Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station.

The REPI program preserves military missions by avoiding land use conflicts near military installations, addressing environmental restrictions that limit military activities and increasing military installation resilience.

The partners include the Forest Service, Air Force Civil Engineer Center, U.S. Army, Colorado Springs Fire Department, Colorado State Forest Service, Colorado Springs Utilities, Palmer Land Conservancy and the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments.

$3 million REPI-funded projects

Old Stage Road: Treatments began in August 2025 and will continue throughout 2026 along the Old Stage Road (National Forest System Road [NSFR] 368) and Gold Camp Road (NFSR 370) in partnership with the Colorado Springs Fire Department.

East boundary: Scheduled to begin in coordination with the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2026 and continue throughout 2027, this project will protect the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Forest Service will establish resilient landscapes by removing unhealthy trees and reducing dangerous fuel sources, as well as creating strategic firebreaks and control lines near the military installation.

$4.3 million partner-funded projects

The additional funding in partner contributions will support additional treatments on approximately 1,000 acres at other locations near the military installations.

As part of these projects, residents living within or near the Colorado Springs wildland urban interface can expect to see removal, chipping or mastication of small to intermediate-sized vegetation, mostly along roadway corridors. The work will be completed using various small and large machines, including masticators, harvesters, forwarders, skidders, brush hogs, mowers and chippers, as well as chainsaws, brush saws and nonmotorized hand tools.

The partners will collaborate to implement multiple projects using REPI and partner funding, capitalizing on partnerships, and leveraging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service’s National Active Forest Management Strategy and the key priorities outlined under President Trump’s Executive Order: Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.

The War Department’s REPI program was established in 2002 as part of the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act by supporting cost-sharing agreements between the military services, other federal agencies, state and local governments and private organizations.

Illinois continues to deliver a strong environment for private investment in EV infrastructure by expanding access to reliable, convenient charging for drivers.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school, or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable, and reliable. Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow — creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure, and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

IONNA is a joint venture founded by eight global automakers, deploying EV fast charging infrastructure nationwide. IONNA’s charging stations are accessible to all-electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors. Among the new charging sites in Illinois, IONNA is powering 10 charging bays — electrified by ComEd — at Wally’s in Pontiac, creating access to local retail operations for Illinois EV drivers.

“Our goal at IONNA is simple: provide easy and stress-free EV charging for our drivers,” said IONNA CEO Seth Cutler. “By bringing fast, reliable charging to familiar stops like Wally’s in Pontiac, we’re giving Illinois drivers the confidence to travel farther, stop comfortably, and enjoy the journey — whether they’re commuting, running errands, or taking a road trip.”

“Wally’s — the Home of the Great American Road Trip — is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort, and reliability our guests expect,” said Wally’s Co-Founder and CEO Michael Rubenstein.

“The new and improved EV infrastructure at Wally's is another step forward for our community — supporting cleaner transportation, encouraging innovation, and making it easier for residents and visitors alike to choose sustainable options,” said Pontiac Mayor Kelly A. Eckhoff. “New station will attract road travelers, encourage longer stops, and brings more dollars to our local economy, while also preparing Pontiac for the future of transportation.”

“ComEd is committed to helping northern Illinois customers and communities unlock the sustainability and cost saving benefits of EVs,” said ComEd President and CEO Gil Quiniones. “Working closely with the state of Illinois, EV companies and communities across the region, we have helped facilitate the expansion of a widespread network of charging stations to serve the region, strengthened by the most reliable grid in the country.”

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants. So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports.

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program — which delivers a check to eligible purchasers — includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV, and $1,500 for electric motorcycles. By doubling down in the face of federal roadblocks, Illinois is encouraging sustained growth in the EV sector.

Illinois EV Growth

This combination of public leadership and private investment is helping drive rapid EV growth statewide:

Illinois’ commitment to expanding EV infrastructure benefits Illinois’ local economies and EV and component manufacturers alike. As the state’s EV market grows through strategic investments and competitive incentives, more well-paying jobs are created for Illinois’ unmatched workforce. In May, Governor Pritzker announced EV manufacturer Rivian’s $120 million investment in a new supplier park, which will support hundreds of new jobs and suppliers.

Alongside the charging site in Pontiac, other IONNA rechargeries across Illinois include:

Six other IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights, and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live.

Such a ruling could give companies more negotiating power over the FCC, said NSR’s Blair Levin

The FCC is also in the middle of a congressional oversight hearing

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now faces Supreme Court scrutiny over its power to issue fines, stemming from the agency’s decision to penalize the major carriers for location sharing.

In 2024, the FCC fined AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing access to customers’ location information without consent. All three carriers sought review from the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing the FCC’s procedure violated their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

The Fifth Circuit agreed with AT&T that the FCC violated the constitution, whereas the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit (which reviewed Verizon’s and T-Mobile’s cases, respectively) sided with the FCC.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for both the AT&T and Verizon cases, which in turn could impact the ruling against T-Mobile. A T-Mo spokesperson told Fierce in August it’s “currently reviewing the court’s action.”

No matter how the hearing shakes out, the FCC won’t lose its enforcement role, said New Street Research Policy Analyst Blair Levin in a note today. If the Court upholds the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the FCC would not be able to impose monetary penalties on defendants without a jury trial.

The carriers chose to pay the fines and then appeal them in the circuit courts. Interestingly, had they declined to pay, the Department of Justice could have brought a collection suit which would have resulted in a jury trial, Levin said.

The Commission “will retain authority to investigate, develop factual records, issue subpoenas and other actions necessary to investigate potential rule violations,” he said, as well as the ability to negotiate settlements based on its investigative findings.

Companies would also have a bigger say against FCC decisions. “All companies that are the target of FCC investigations will be in a stronger negotiating position,” Levin added.

FCC in hot water with Congress

The Supreme Court hearing looms as the FCC testifies before Congress on agency oversight.

Today’s congressional hearing comes as FCC Chair Brendan Carr boasts a massive telecom deregulatory initiative while increasing scrutiny over diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), mergers and broadcast media.

Concerns about the FCC’s oversight further arose after Carr in December commented that the FCC ""is not an independent agency, formally speaking."" The word “independent” is no longer included in the FCC’s online mission statement.

In his opening remarks, Rep, Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) welcomed today’s hearing as “an opportunity to discuss the many important issues before the FCC.” He praised the agency’s deregulatory agenda but urged the FCC to be mindful of issues such as Universal Service Fund (USF) reform, spectrum policy and “modernizing outdated media ownership rules.”

On the other hand, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) slammed Carr for overstepping the FCC’s bounds.

“Over the last year, Chairman Carr has grossly distorted the power and purpose of the FCC,” Pallone stated. “He has weaponized the agency to benefit Trump and punish anyone who challenges him. He has rubber-stamped shady deals between media conglomerates when those deals have included monetary and political benefits for the President.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/esmmmc_starr_image_of_a_gavel_in_the_U.S._Supreme_Court._11a156fa-9da6-4410-a516-ce8ad075b458.png?VersionId=oTsSZBO.ReTGaAh.4.0dMSNb4.xD_gL.,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:22.747691

Manufacturing construction spending in the U.S. has gone down after peaking in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The latest report from E2 shows that in 2025, companies canceled over $32 billion worth of clean energy manufacturing projects due to reduced government incentives and funding cuts, as well as tariff policies.

But, at the same time, some industry giants have significantly increased investment in the U.S. Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced a $100 billion investment with three new fabs, two advanced packaging facilities and an R&D center. Midyear, Micron revealed plans for a $200 billion investment in Idaho, New York, and Virginia with semiconductor manufacturing plants and an R&D center.

These investments partly stem from the new federal policies that aim to incentivize domestic production by making imports and hiring foreign workers more expensive. Other factors include funding from the CHIPS Act as well as state or local tax credits for job creation.

The announcements are a combination of building new facilities and expanding existing plants. Here are some of the biggest projects set to break ground or begin operations in 2026.

Micron

Product: Memory chips

Overall investment: $200 billion

Locations: Idaho, New York and Virginia

Timeline: Construction of the New York fab began in January

Micron’s memory manufacturing facility in New York broke ground earlier this month, and production at its Idaho site is expected to begin next year.

The company is investing $200 billion across multiple facilities, with plans to spend $150 billion on fabs and $50 billion on R&D. The project includes two fabs in Idaho, four fabs in New York and the expansion of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia.

The project, which aims to produce 40% of the company’s dynamic random access memory in the U.S., is estimated to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

The announcement was made in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce with $6.4 billion in funding through the CHIPS and Science Act.

Samsung Electronics

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $17 billion

Location: Texas

Timeline: Expected to be operational in 2026

Samsung’s “initial minimum investment” for a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, is said to be the largest foreign investment in the state.

Construction was halted last year due to reduced demand and resumed in mid-2025. The factory is expected to be operational in 2026, and the company estimates the project will create 1,800 jobs within a decade.

Earlier, Samsung had planned $44 billion worth of investment in Texas, for which it was granted $6.4 billion in funding under the CHIPS Act. As the company reduced the investment to $37 billion, funding was cut to $4.7 billion.

The project is a part of a broader multibillion-dollar expansion in the region, where the company said it has invested over $47 billion since the 1970s.

Stellantis

Product: Vehicles

Investment: $13 billion

Locations: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio

Timeline: Indiana facility begins production in 2026, others by the end of the decade

Stellantis is investing $13 billion across the U.S. to expand production by 50% over the next four years.

In Indiana, the company will produce a new four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. In Illinois, there are plans to reopen a facility and begin production of two new Jeep vehicles in 2027.

In Michigan, the project will retool the Warren Truck Assembly Plant for a new range-extended electric vehicle and large SUV expected to be ready by 2028. The Detroit Assembly Complex will see production of the next-gen Dodge Durango by 2029.

This is the company’s biggest investment in the U.S. and is expected to create over 5,000 jobs.

Lilly is set to begin construction on its $6 billion active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, this year. The plant is part of the company’s $27 billion investment to build four new pharmaceutical production facilities across the U.S.

One of the confirmed sites includes a $6.5 billion plant in Houston. This facility is expected to be operational within roughly five years after construction begins. The second site is a $5 billion cancer drug facility in Richmond, Virginia, also expected to be completed in five years.

Together, the projects fall under the company’s broader plan to invest $50 billion in expanding production in the country, which it describes as the largest pharmaceutical investment in U.S. history.

The pace of change has been unusually rapid, with policy direction driven largely by executive action, emerging national security priorities, tariff expansion, shifting enforcement patterns, and supply chain pressures that require companies to rethink how they structure cross-border trade.

Over the last year, there have been fundamental changes with regard to tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and US outbound investment regulations. These changes are altering risk profiles and challenging long-standing assumptions. Businesses are navigating these developments against a backdrop of global conflict, geopolitical realignment, domestic policy reversals, evolving due diligence expectations, and increasingly complex international commercial relationships.

The US approach remains highly dynamic: transactional in tone, industry-specific in impact, and shaped by shifting policy levers used to advance national and economic security objectives. Looking ahead to 2026, companies should expect continued movement in tariffs, growing export control restrictions, and trade enforcement investigations, with long-term implications for supply chains, investment strategy, compliance planning, and commercial contracting.

This Insight highlights key themes and takeaways from 2025, organized around three core areas: (1) trade and investment policy trends, (2) export controls and sanctions developments, and (3) tariff expansion and litigation outlook.

TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY: STRUCTURAL SHIFTS WITH OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES

A Markedly Different Policy Environment

The US administration entered this term with more focused preparation, clearer objectives, and a more expansive policy agenda than in 2017. The result is an assertive approach to trade and investment, focused less on multilateral engagement and more on maximizing US leverage and domestic economic outcomes. Businesses are seeking to understand the implications of this shift, particularly as policy is now centered on a more mercantilist, transactional framework that elevates economic nationalism and hard-power trade tools over soft-power diplomacy.

Tariffs have been a primary driver of this new posture. Many increases exceeded expectations in both scale and scope, particularly for China, with rates in some categories rising far beyond the levels the market anticipated earlier in the year. These changes contributed to significant planning challenges and reshaped sourcing strategies, pricing models, and investment decisions for companies across sectors, although in many cases implementation of the tariff increases were postponed or exemptions were created, muting the overall effect.

Governance by Executive Action

The Trump administration relies heavily on executive orders and emergency authorities to implement trade and investment measures, ranging from tariff imposition to sanctions expansion and investment controls. This approach reflects both a broad view of presidential authority and a willingness to test the limits of that authority through litigation up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. This emphasis on executive authority and an accommodative majority in Congress has diminished the role of the legislature and increased legal and operational uncertainty for businesses planning around public policy timelines.

Effects on Multinational Corporations

Macroeconomic, policy, and geopolitical dynamics combined to create new layers of commercial complexity. Some of the most significant business impacts include the following:

Persistent supply chain disruption: Ongoing global conflicts, dynamic imposition of tariffs, and expansion of export controls continue to affect sourcing, transportation flows, logistics planning, and long-term manufacturing footprints.

Tariff-driven cost pressure: Tariffs remain difficult to predict, and exemption pathways have been unevenly implemented, increasing cost and slowing decision-making. Companies face pressure to realign sourcing, but many hesitate without greater clarity.

Fragmented ESG and DEI legal environment: Conflicting state, national, and international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements are producing overlapping (and sometimes contradictory) legal obligations, particularly in disclosures, sustainability strategy, and climate transition planning.

Immigration-related workforce challenges: Talent mobility has become more difficult amid tightened controls on visas and student access, heightened enforcement activity, and changing compliance expectations.

Sector-specific effects: Deregulation and policy support for oil, gas, coal, artificial intelligence, and digital assets stand in contrast to increasing pressure on renewable energy, life sciences, and automotive/retail supply chains.

New Challenges for Corporate Planning and Compliance

Legal and compliance teams are operating in an environment where policy shifts can materially alter contract rights, pricing models, investment strategies, and disclosure requirements.

Organizations face pressure to remain current on rapidly shifting executive actions, assess enforcement risk in evolving regulatory regimes, and align public disclosures with material tariff and trade risks. Many are also confronting conflicting obligations across jurisdictions and increasingly renegotiating supply contracts to account for cost volatility and tariff exposure.

These pressures mean risk management now requires deeper integration of trade policy forecasting with commercial planning and capital allocation models, and greater emphasis on scenario analysis, contract flexibility, and proactive stakeholder communication.

EXPORT CONTROLS, SANCTIONS, AND NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEWS: A MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT LANDSCAPE

Shift in National Security Priorities

The US administration’s 2025 priorities reflect heightened focus on trade and customs fraud, sanctions violations, drug cartel-related activity, and countering China. These priorities are shaping enforcement activity and driving new due diligence requirements, particularly in higher-risk markets and regions.

Export Controls: Broader Jurisdiction and Enhanced Risk

Export controls are increasingly used as an economic policy tool in addition to their traditional national security function. Recent developments include (1) expanded export controls targeting semiconductors, AI, and other sensitive technologies, and China-related supply chains; and (2) broadening of the Entity List to include affiliates of listed entities, which significantly increases due diligence burdens.

Although implementation of the Affiliates Rule is suspended for one year as part of a bilateral economic agreement with China, companies should use this period to prepare for expanded compliance requirements and documentation expectations once the suspension period ends.

Sanctions: Evolving Tools and New Applications

This year also saw meaningful changes to sanctions programs, including the below:

Designation of major drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, increasing exposure risk for companies with operations or counterparties in Mexico and Latin America. These designations expanded investigative tools and authorities available to investigators, including material-support-to-terrorism charges and enhanced intelligence access.

Use of FinCEN special measures as a sanctions-like tool to restrict funds transfers involving financial institutions linked to illicit opioid trafficking.

New sanctions programs and novel uses of existing programs targeting perceived adversaries of the US administration under corruption and counter-narcotics programs. The administration reinstated sanctions on the International Criminal Court.

Additionally, 2025 saw the termination of the Syria and West Bank sanctions programs along with a heightened focus on Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia. While it has been slow to impose additional sanctions on Russia, the current administration did announce in the last quarter sanctions on two major oil and gas companies to put additional pressure on Russia to engage in peace negotiations over Ukraine.

Outbound Investment and Supply Chain Restrictions

Regulators continue to sharpen focus on outbound investment flows affecting sensitive technology sectors in China in an effort to curtail US investments facilitating the development of sensitive technologies and furthering China’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.

Requirements now include notification obligations and, in some areas, prohibitions on US investment in Chinese companies operating in certain sectors and industries.

This trend is reinforced by Foreign Entity of Concern rules under the Inflation Reduction Act, limiting tax credit eligibility for renewable energy components with certain Chinese ties, as well as ongoing developments under the ICTS supply chain program. The National Defense Authorization Act passed in the last quarter did include provisions addressing both outbound investment in and the procurement of biopharmaceutical inputs from countries of concern.

Operational Challenges

Across the cross-border transaction landscape, businesses face sharply increased expectations around due diligence and reduced predictability in licensing and review timelines. These pressures are prompting companies to reassess compliance resources, documentation practices, and internal review protocols to identify and mitigate gaps that could elevate enforcement or transactional risk.

Compounding these challenges is a significant backlog on export classification and licensing applications before US government regulators. Much of this backlog has been exacerbated by staffing reductions, agency turnover, and disruptions caused by the recent government shutdown. Taken together, these factors delay processing times, increase uncertainty around timing and outcomes, and require companies to build greater flexibility into commercial planning, supply chain decisions, and investment strategy.

Companies are reevaluating their compliance frameworks, particularly around counterparty screening, recordkeeping, training, and reporting procedures, as the enforcement environment continues to evolve.

TARIFFS AND TRADE REMEDIES: NEW STRUCTURES, HIGHER RATES, LITIGATION RISK

Tariff Expansion Continues

Tariff activity accelerated significantly in 2025, reshaping import economics and altering long-term strategic planning for US and multinational companies. Tariffs are being deployed as a tool for both economic leverage and national security objectives, affecting a wide range of goods and industries. Key areas of focus include the following:

Section 232 (national security) tariffs affecting imports of steel, aluminum, vehicles and parts, copper, timber, trucks, and lumber and timber, with ongoing investigations concerning semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and more

Section 301 tariffs targeting acts and practices of identified trading partners, primarily China, related to identified unfair trading practices

Section 201 safeguards relating to solar cells and modules (expiring February 2026)

International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) tariffs imposed under emergency authorities, including broad reciprocal rates and trafficking-related tariffs targeting Canada, Mexico, and China

Secondary tariffs on Venezuelan and Russian oil, currently imposed only on India

Elimination of de minimis entry thresholds for low-value goods

These measures, layered on top of standard customs duties, have led importers to assess classification, valuation, country of origin, and eligibility under trade agreements with greater precision.

Ongoing bilateral negotiations with major trading partners are creating tariff variability based on region and product category, offering targeted relief but also increasing planning uncertainty.

Litigation and Policy Horizon for 2026

Importers closely await the Supreme Court’s decision on IEEPA-based tariff authority, argued on November 5, 2025. A ruling is expected in early 2026, although the timing may shift. The outcome could reshape tariff structures, refund potential, and future presidential authority, all of which is driving increased interest in protective refund claims and importer-specific litigation.

Meanwhile, pending trade investigations under Section 232 could trigger new tariffs on critical industries, and the first joint review under USMCA will occur in July 2026, potentially opening the door to major renegotiation.

Practical Impacts for Businesses

Importers should expect

continued tariff cost volatility,

increased complexity in supply chain contracting,

valuation and classification challenges,

expanded due diligence requirements, and

intensified scrutiny in corporate transactions, investor reporting, and insurance underwriting.

Companies should also prepare for potential refund scenarios under certain tariff programs, particularly if litigation outcomes or negotiations alter duty obligations retroactively.

LOOKING AHEAD

The United States continues to redefine its role in global trade and investment. Increased and novel use of trade policy tools such as emergency tariffs, outbound investment controls, and sanctions tied to cartel activity, are now fundamental. Export controls are broadening in scope and purpose, sanctions programs are expanding into new areas, and the implementation of outbound investment restrictions are changing how businesses implement their commercial and operational strategies.

For companies, the result is a more complex and risky regulatory environment that demands proactive planning and resilient operating models. To address this, companies are

evaluating and strengthening trade compliance infrastructure,

increasing their visibility into multi-tier supply chains,

reassessing sourcing and logistics footprints,

integrating tariff, export control, and sanctions forecasting into budgeting,

updating contractual protections to reduce the risk of indirect violations and specifically allocate risk and responsibility for tariffs, and

aligning public disclosures with evolving risk profiles.

Building agility into trade strategy will be critical in 2026. The companies best positioned to thrive in this environment will be those that embed trade intelligence into cross-functional decision-making—connecting policy tracking to procurement, pricing, capital investment, manufacturing, and technology strategy.

Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.” “I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said.
“In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.” Sabula is a member of the UAW.
“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.","As Trump was exiting the plant Tuesday, a worker could be heard on video obtained by TMZ calling the president a “pedophile protector,” an apparent reference to the records of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump could be seen shouting an expletive and extending his middle finger in response, Automotive News reported.

The Washington Post identified Trump’s heckler as TJ Sabula, who said Ford had suspended him while it investigates the incident. Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.”

“I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said. “I understand that gets a lot of social media play, and that’s the world we live in. But it was a very small part of the day.”

A White House spokesperson said in a statement to TMZ: “A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.""

In his keynote conversation with Michigan State University President Kevin Guskiewicz on Wednesday at Huntington Place convention center, Buttigieg said Trump has been a union buster and presided over the loss of manufacturing jobs across America.

“And then when somebody sees someone as powerful as him come into their workplace, (Trump) gives them the old f- you,” said Buttigieg, who served in the Biden administration. “In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.”

Sabula is a member of the UAW. Laura Dickerson, UAW vice president and Ford department director, said in a statement that the union will protect its workers' free speech rights on the job.

""The UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member,"" Dickerson said in a statement. ""Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.""

Sabula is already the beneficiary of multiple GoFundMe campaigns launched on his behalf, which as of mid-afternoon Wednesday total more than $600,000.

One campaign, opened by Sean Williams, who is based in South Carolina, according to his GoFundMe profile, calls Sabula a ""patriot,"" and had raised $374,003 and with nearly 17,000 donations as of Wednesday afternoon. The other, organized by Diandra Gourlay of Highland Park, had raised $227,509 with more than 9,000 donations.

“This is a worker who spoke his mind to the most powerful person in the country, and he is well within his rights to do that as an American,” Buttigieg said to reporters.

In 2020, President Joe Biden was in a testy exchange with a pro-gun autoworker during a plant tour in Detroit over Biden's plan to reinstate an assault weapons ban. Biden told the worker he was ""full of s---"" after the worker confronted him and accused him of working to end Second Amendment rights.

Buttigieg’s conversation with Guskiewicz was punctuated by the occasional rumble of the Detroit People Mover traveling through the Huntington Place station near the convention center. Buttigieg used the opportunity to speak on how innovation in the transit space is necessary to reduce the risk of automotive crashes.

Approximately 40,000 people die preventable deaths each year while driving in the U.S., Buttigieg said.

“Getting from an airport to a city center in this country is an embarrassment compared to what it is in most places. We could do something about it, using technology and public investment to better integrate transit with roadways,” Buttigieg said. He also voiced support for autonomous vehicles, calling them safer than the average American driver.

Waymo, a Google-affiliated autonomous vehicle company, came to Detroit in November to begin testing fully autonomous ride-hailing services across the city.

“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.

To keep it that way, he called for a bigger push of investment in electric vehicles, criticizing the “whiplash” between the policies of the two recent federal administrations.

“There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector,” Buttigieg said. “There is a big question about whether America will lead that. I see the innovation, the determination, the dedication of U.S. automakers and their teams, their workers and their leaders to make sure that is so.”

There is some speculation about Buttigieg's interest in the 2028 presidential election. He plans to travel to Cleveland on Thursday for an appearance and plans to participate in a town hall in La Crosse, Wis., on Friday.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/447592617.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:44.130860

American energy producers are at the helm of a “demand decade,” supporting access to reliable and efficient energy resources worldwide, API President and CEO Mike Sommers highlighted as he talked about the scale and global significance of U.S. energy production.

As the world’s top producer of oil and natural gas and the leading LNG exporter, the United States is integral to ensuring energy security while driving lower emissions. Sommers stressed the efficiency and environmental standards that differentiates U.S. energy on the global stage:

“No other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions. It’s the result of a system built on certainty, stability, and clear rules—where companies can invest, innovate, and deliver energy at scale with confidence.”

Demand Is Rising and Energy Realism Is Taking Hold

Speakers rejected the notion that oil and natural gas demand is peaking. Instead, global and domestic demand reached record highs in 2025, driven by broad economic and human needs. Coined the “demand decade,” API estimated that U.S. electricity demand will surge by 35-50 percent between 2024 and 2040. Many speakers argued that AI is not the only factor driving energy demand, rather demand is multifaceted.

Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners summarized the economic importance of this growth plainly:

“Energy is the essential input that drives the entire economy… Not everyone is a driller, everyone is a driver.”

Looking ahead to the midterm elections, Sommers highlighted a national shift in public and political attitudes toward energy:

“As we head into this midterm election year, we are looking at a national shift. Americans are embracing energy realism.”

This is evident in blue-states walking back ambitious climate targets across the country. States that initially pushed ambitious climate mandates are now adjusting as cost and reliability gaps become clear. California has expanded drilling and encouraged refineries to stay open, while New York is reconsidering parts of its 2019 climate law due to rising energy costs and potential grid shortfalls, just to name two. These examples show policymakers and consumers are increasingly demanded abundant, affordable and reliable energy.

Infrastructure Is the Limiting Factor

Despite record production, speakers emphasized that insufficient infrastructure remains a central constraint on affordability and reliability. Expanding pipelines, power generation, and transmission capacity are critical to meet rising demand through effective permitting reform.

Toby Z. Rice, President & CEO of EQT discussed the urgent need to build quickly:

“To win the AI race, this country needs a tremendous amount of infrastructure. If you want access to this power, you’ve got to build it… Our number one priority is keeping the lights on and keeping bills low. We are dead set serious about that, and building infrastructure is the key.”

Speakers agreed that expanding infrastructure and addressing regulatory bottlenecks are essential. Outdated permitting rules are a major bottleneck, with environmental reviews now taking nearly four years on average – double the time they took in the 1970s. Projects face additional delays due to litigation, creating uncertainty and deferring investment in critical infrastructure.

Without clear policies and timely permitting, affordability, reliability, and U.S. energy leadership are at risk.

Regulatory Complexity

Beyond physical infrastructure, regulatory complexity is a major barrier to meeting rising energy demand. Panelists emphasized that permitting reform and clear rules are closely connected—without regulatory certainty, even approved projects face delays, higher costs, and operational challenges.

President and CEO of Cheniere Energy Jack Fusco highlighted the scale of oversight facing developers:

“Regulatory overreach. We deal with 54 agencies. We need clarity and coordination…We need help making sure we can do our jobs and do them well and not stuck publishing reports.”

These delays have real consequences for consumers and the broader economy. As sectors like data centers and AI drive unprecedented electricity demand, slow decision-making and overlapping regulations strain the energy system and prevent buildout.

Addressing regulatory complexity is essential not only for operational efficiency, but for keeping energy affordable, reliable, and competitive in the “demand decade.” Chairman, President and CEO Maryann Mannen of Marathon Petroleum underscored this importance for future U.S. dominance:

“Permitting reform, policy clarity, putting rules in place that are supportive of ensuring we’ve got U.S. energy independence is really critical.”

U.S. Energy Leadership and Global Competitiveness

Panelists reinforced the critical role of American energy in both domestic and global markets. Sommers noted the nation’s leadership, stating:

“U.S. oil and natural gas companies now play an outsized role in meeting global energy demand, reducing the influence of hostile regimes and providing the vital products that have lifted billions out of poverty and enable people all over the world to thrive.”

For example in 2025 the U.S. exported a record 11 million metric tons of LNG, marking a 24 percent year-over-year increase. With monthly and annual production hitting all-time highs, the U.S. is reinforcing its position as the world’ benchmark for stable and abundant energy. This unprecedented production provides balance to international markets, reduces global price volatility, and ensures Americans have access to dependable energy at home.

Panelists said U.S. energy leadership keeps energy affordable at home and competitive abroad, with American production widely seen as the global benchmark. As Sommers put it, U.S. energy is the “envy of the world,” but sustaining that leadership will require continued investment and infrastructure to meet growing global demand.

This leadership is particularly important as U.S. and global markets grapple with a potential reopening of Venezuela oil markets.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:48.713714

Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel.
Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset.
Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence.
When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.","Northern PSC Commissioner Chris Brown says nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it.

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.",https://magnoliatribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-133930.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:00:19.541521

Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News.
By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done.","Tesla’s once-dominant position in Canada took a dramatic hit in 2025, as a perfect storm of policy changes, trade tensions, and market shifts sent sales tumbling to their lowest level in years.

New registration data compiled from multiple industry sources shows Tesla delivered between 18,300 and 20,000 vehicles in Canada for the full year, down significantly from the roughly 55,000 units in 2024.

That works out to a 63–67% year-over-year decline, making Canada one of Tesla’s weakest major markets globally in 2025.

The damage was most severe in the first half of the year. Registrations between January and June came in at just 9,000 vehicles, down from more than 26,000 in the same period in 2024. Quebec was hit especially hard after the province paused its EV rebate program at the end of 2024 for several months, causing Tesla sales in the province to plunge nearly 85% in Q1 alone.

DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, an auto industry data firm, confirmed that Tesla’s Canadian sales fell by more than 60%, but also noted a partial recovery later in the year. That rebound came after Tesla began importing Model Y vehicles from Giga Berlin, which allowed the company to avoid U.S.-related tariffs that were applied to American-built vehicles entering Canada.

That shift was crucial. U.S.–Canada trade measures imposed in 2025 made Teslas built in Fremont (Tesla has never imported vehicles from Giga Texas into Canada) far more expensive, just as federal and provincial EV incentives were being reduced or eliminated.

The broader EV sector also struggled in 2025, but not nearly to the same degree. Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News. Meanwhile, overall new-vehicle sales actually grew about 2%, reaching roughly 1.9 million units.

Globally, Tesla also faced a difficult year. The company delivered 1,636,129 vehicles in 2025, down about 9% from 2024. While Tesla does not publish country-level sales figures, this data shows Canada’s decline was far steeper than Tesla’s worldwide average, highlighting how uniquely difficult 2025 was for the brand north of the border.

By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done. With incentives gone and trade barriers still in place, Tesla now enters 2026 facing a very different Canadian market than the one that powered its record-breaking 2024.",https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/modely-snow.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:01:06.340741

Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994.
This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.
​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”","The U.S. House just voted to cancel efficiency standards for new manufactured homes — a move that could hit especially hard in the Southeast, where such housing is common and energy insecurity is high.

The measure would rescind 2022 criteria for insulation, air sealing, and other energy-saving features in prefabricated, or mobile, homes, restoring weaker standards more than 30 years old. The legislation comes as utility bills are rising fast nationwide — and if it is passed by the Senate and signed into law, it could cost households in double-wide houses hundreds more per year in increased electricity costs.

“The very first energy bill that the House of Representatives passed this year would increase energy costs on some of the households and families in the United States that are most struggling to make ends meet,” said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ​“This will have more harmful impacts in the Southeast than anywhere else in the country.”

Of the 4.7 million prefab homes delivered nationwide in recent decades, more than half are in just 10 southern states. Texas leads the country, with nearly 600,000 units, and North Carolina is second, with over 330,000, according to the U.S. Census.

Manufactured homes are exempt from state and local energy codes, and older models are notoriously energy inefficient, with thin insulation, drafty windows and doors, and often outdated modes of heating and cooling. Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.

“Utility costs can be in the several hundred dollars for folks in a manufactured house,” said Claire Williamson, senior energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income families. She added that “$300, $400, even $500 a month in peak costs is not trivial.”

The prefabricated homes exacerbate energy insecurity in the Southeast, which is the most energy-burdened region in the country: One in three households in the region struggles to pay their utility bills, according to the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994. In 2007, a bipartisan law directed the Department of Energy to issue more protective rules. In 2022, the Biden administration finally did so, but the new criteria were paused last summer by the Trump administration.

The Manufactured Housing Institute, the trade group for prefabricated home builders, has long fought against the stricter standards, which it argues are too costly, confusing, and bureaucratic.

The bipartisan bill that passed the House last week largely gives the builders what they want, restoring the 1994 standards and preventing the Department of Energy from ever issuing stronger rules.

The 2022 rules were expected to cost an average of $4,222 per double-wide home up front but pay for themselves in the form of lower energy bills in less than five years. For single-wide units, the additional up-front costs were pegged at $660, which households would recoup within one year.

“This is so clearly about the homebuilder special interests,” Williamson said, ​“and has nothing to do with ensuring better, more affordable housing for people.”

About half of all factory-made homes are already built to efficiency standards that are much stricter than those rescinded by the House, said Grant Beck, vice president of strategic partnerships at Next Step Network, a Kentucky-based nonprofit that supports ownership of prefab homes.

This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.

“We understand that we’re in an affordability crisis, particularly with relation to housing and first-time home buyers trying to enter the market,” Beck said. ​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Mobile-home-park-TX_GettyImages-539746440.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f4c0e7c67f8bfe36bb0bcc978df18ff2,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:14.480322

A new University of Michigan survey of 1,000 rural Michigan residents reveals a striking gap between perception and reality when it comes to electric vehicles.

Researchers found that only 5% would choose an electric vehicle as their next car, which is lower than national averages. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, shed light on how cost concerns, limited exposure and misconceptions keep EVs from gaining traction in rural areas.

The study helps researchers understand why EV penetration is as low as it is, and provides clues about what to do about it (provide better information and visibly improve charging infrastructure, said Parth Vaishnav, U-M assistant professor of environment and sustainability.

“The shift to EVs is essential to ensure that the U.S. car industry remains globally competitive: The rest of the world is shifting decisively to EV’s, particularly the high-growth markets of the Global South,” he said.

It is also essential to reduce climate change. Both automakers and environmentalists should want EVs to command a healthy market share in the U.S.; this is particularly crucial for Michigan, where the auto industry is a linchpin of prosperity, Parth said.

Perception vs. reality

The U-M team found that many rural drivers significantly underestimate how well EVs could fit their lives. For example:

Nearly half of respondents said a home Level 2 charger wouldn’t meet their needs, yet three-quarters could easily cover their daily driving with one.

Thirty percent believe there’s no public charger nearby, even though about half actually live within five miles of a fast charger.

More than one-third said they prefer gas-powered cars for cost reasons—but two-thirds of those drivers could afford an electric model within their reported budget range.

Why the gap matters

Previous studies have examined general barriers to EV adoption, such as range anxiety and limited charging access, but few have focused on rural drivers. This research digs deeper, combining survey results with real-world data on charging stations and EV listings across Michigan.

Researchers analyzed three key ownership factors:

Ability to charge at home (typically overnight using a Level 2 outlet)

Access to convenient public chargers

Availability of new and used EVs within personal budgets

They also assessed how people’s perceptions align—or clash—with reality. The findings reveal that over half of rural respondents are pessimistic about what EV ownership would require. Meanwhile, misinformation fuels hesitation. Crucially, this is a predictor of interest in new or used EVs.

Beyond infrastructure: The information challenge

While improving rural charging networks remains crucial, the study suggests that information may be just as important. Researchers found that:

Fifty-five percent of those who doubt they can charge at home cited driving “too much in a day” as the reason, despite most logging miles well within current EV capabilities.

Concerns about safety, maintenance and resale value persist, often rooted in a lack of trustworthy information.

The findings highlight that boosting rural EV adoption will require not only infrastructure, but also clear communication about what electric cars can already deliver today and throughout the EVs lifetime.

A road map to rural adoption

Taken together, U-M’s research suggests that the path to higher EV adoption in rural America may be smoother than many think—if drivers get the trustworthy information about their concerns.

“More than half of Michigan’s rural residents are more pessimistic than they need to be,” said Anna Stefanopoulou, U-M professor of mechanical engineering. “Drivers need to see in their dashboard reliable information about the battery state of health, which tells them how far they can go in our freezing winters and how long they can rely on their EV before the battery starts degrading. With this information, the used EVs that have a lower cost might start to look a lot more practical.”

Current global efforts for a battery certificate, which includes an indicator of battery sustainability based on the emissions and the energy associated with the production and eventual disposal of this particular battery, might also help consumer confidence.",https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2026/01/gaps-between-perception-and-reality-might-be-putting-the-brakes-on-electric-vehicle-sales-in-rural-michigan-sabrina-tomkins.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:00:52.880820

According to IRENA’s figures, the total renewable energy workforce grew 2.3% to 16.6 million in 2024, against a record 15% increase in the total renewable power capacity in 2024 to 4,443GW.

The growth in solar jobs reflected this pattern, with the 32% growth in solar capacity in 2024 far outstripping the increase in jobs in the sector.

IRENA said the relatively slower growth in jobs in 2024 indicated that the energy transition had entered a “new phase”, in which automation and economies of scale meant comparatively less human labour was needed to build each new unit of capacity.

Another factor IRENA said was the scale of deployment, with decentralised rooftop solar being more labour-intensive than utility-scale projects. The emergence of artificial intelligence in the coming years will also have “far-reaching impacts”, though how this will impact job losses or gains “remains to be seen”, the agency said.

IRENA director-general, Francesco La Camera, said: “Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side. Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.

The change means that beginning in February, rather than March, Duke customers in Florida will see an approximately $33 reduction to their monthly bills compared to January per 1,000 kilowatt-hours used.

Commercial and industrial customers’ bills will drop anywhere from 9.6% to 15.8% when compared to January, the amount of which depends on several factors, the company said.

“We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,” Duke Energy Florida State President Melissa Seixas said. “It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.”

More savings are on the way in March, too. Residential customers can expect to see an approximately $11 decrease per 1,000 kilowatt-hours used per month as a result of seasonal decreases Duke institutes annually from March through November to help customers save money during times when electricity use is higher due to higher temperatures.

Westwood Energy Secondaries Fund II raised a collective $300 million, with the main fund raising $174 million and two co-investment vehicles raising $106 million and $20 million respectively, Westwood president of real assets Greg Reid told Secondaries Investor.

The raise exceeded its $150 million target, and the fund has already called about $200 million.

Fund II marks a significant step up from its $34 million predecessor, which also had a $14 million co-invest vehicle. However, Reid noted that the fund was originally only raised to invest in one continuation fund, which received $3 million from Fund I plus a capital from a $14 million co-investment fund. After that deal closed, Westwood found itself with dry powder and so it pivoted plans, acquiring 15 LP stakes.

“We wanted to take advantage of what we thought was a big mismatch between primarily institutional sellers who wanted liquidity and a relatively few number of buyers willing to step into an illiquid private energy fund,” Reid said about the strategy.

Reid said the Dallas-headquartered firm’s pipeline sits at around $800 million, and the fund could be “properly put to work” in the first or second quarter of the year.

About 70 percent of the fund will go toward LP-led transactions, with the remaining 30 percent earmarked for continuation vehicles and direct investments, Reid said. The fund is currently 88 percent allocated to LP-leds and 12 percent to CVs, although Reid expects to reach the 70-30 split.

The fund is primarily focused on traditional energy deals, meaning oil and gas. A typical LP-led deal would average about $3 million-$4 million, and Reid said those deals could be as low as $1 million and as high as $90 million. The fund will primarily target LP interests that are seven to 12 years old at a significant discount, the firm said in a statement Wednesday.

Reid said Westwood won’t invest in renewable energy or “anything unproven” and said he considers oil and gas more tried and true, profitable areas of focus. He noted that renewable energy in the US is heavily reliant on government subsidies, which have recently been taken away.

The Trump administration’s tax policy for endowments has also made oil and gas more favourable for buyers. As endowments look to offload their portfolios, Reid said traditional energy sectors are normally at the top of the list and come with discounts.

“If you’re going to go to market and sell an asset class, you’re probably going to sell something you don’t want to own. Energy hits the top of your list,” Reid said. “That’s why it’s so attractive to us, these are pretty proven businesses.”

Reid and Westwood declined to comment on targeted returns. However, Secondaries Investor understands the fund is targeting double-digit returns and a high single-digit yield on the portfolio.",https://media.secondariesinvestor.com/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1225330885.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 15:00:22.020189

“We need to make clean options as cheap, or cheaper, than the dirty way of doing things,” Jackie explained.","Energy systems scientist Jackie Dowling and climate economist Chenfei Qu come from different backgrounds, but both find themselves in the Stanford Energy Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Precourt Institute for Energy, working on interdisciplinary solutions to the challenges facing the clean energy transition.

In a recent conversation, both postdocs sat down to discuss the same question: Where is the energy transition gaining momentum, and what stands in its way?

“Diamonds are made under pressure, and right now, the pressure is climate change and AI,” said Jackie, who earned her Ph.D. at Caltech and begins a tenure-track faculty position at the University of Iowa this month.

Their discussion addresses the deployment gap between clean energy discoveries and the reliable, socially accepted systems needed for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to zero.

“We’re still far from a sufficiently clean electricity system, not because we lack technology, but because of frictions in the real world,” Chenfei said, pointing to factors like unpriced pollution and income losses in fossil-fuel-dependent regions, like her home province in China.

Where momentum is building

In her Ph.D. at Tsinghua University, Chenfei studied China’s emissions trading system, which covers 60% of China’s emissions and almost 20% of global emissions. In her view, China laid the groundwork for carbon pricing in emerging economies that are now beginning to follow suit.

“In emerging economies especially, we are seeing momentum,” Chenfei said. “India, Turkey, Indonesia, and Vietnam are all piloting or expanding carbon pricing. It’s not perfect, but it’s movement. And it shifts the expectations of industry.”

This momentum is especially significant in countries with large manufacturing bases and growing energy demand, Chenfei explained. Raising the cost of carbon in these economies helps drive cleaner production at the source.

Jackie agreed that policy signals matter, and emphasized that not all policy tools operate in the same way, or on the same timeline. While carbon pricing can shape long-term expectations, she argued that many clean energy technologies are still constrained by cost in the near term, particularly in the United States.

“For a lot of these technologies, the problem is still cost,” Jackie said. “We want the cost to be lower.”

Government interventions, such as subsidies, have driven prices down for buyers of newer energy technologies, like solar and wind power, and batteries. But as federal support becomes uncertain, private sector demand becomes the major driver of deployment.

“Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft are interested in 24/7 carbon-free power, and they want it yesterday,” Jackie observed. This demand is accelerating learning curves, particularly for clean firm power options like geothermal, nuclear, and carbon capture, which have remained expensive to develop and deploy despite subsidies. In her Ph.D, Jackie also looked at long-duration energy storage as an enabler of 24/7 carbon-free power systems. It appears corporate urgency is moving the needle on these deep decarbonization technologies, she explained.

Both fellows see the same principle at work: Clear, credible, and sustained signals, whether from policy or corporate commitments, create expectations that drive investment in cleaner technologies.

What stands in the way

Despite progress, the central obstacle to the energy transition is eliminating the “green premium,” Chenfei and Jackie agreed. The term, popularized by Bill Gates, means the extra cost of choosing a clean technology or pathway over the fossil fuel-based incumbent.

“We need to make clean options as cheap, or cheaper, than the dirty way of doing things,” Jackie explained.

At Stanford, her postdoctoral research addressed the challenge of achieving zero-emissions heat for industry and buildings. “For example, there are few options for producing steel with carbon-free, high-temperature heat. You can combust hydrogen, which is quite expensive, or keep using fossil fuels with carbon capture,” she explained. While some firms have electrified steel-making, these methods rely on the availability of cheap electricity to eliminate the green premium.

Chenfei countered that lowering costs alone won’t be enough. Eliminating the green premium also requires driving up the cost of polluting: “Fossil fuels feel free to burn, but they aren’t. Carbon pricing internalizes the externalities, like health and climate impacts, that we are all paying for.”

Jackie nodded. “That price gives scientists and engineers a target,” she said. “You’re setting the goal, and we’re trying to get there.”

Setting that goal can prove politically fraught, as Chenfei explores in her postdoctoral research. She studies who benefits and who bears the costs of the energy transition, and how those impacts vary by region. Even well-designed policies to fairly price carbon are often delayed or diluted by concerns over short-term economic impacts and loss of competitiveness, she explained. For instance, countries with large industrial sectors are hesitant to impose strict domestic climate policies if countries with competing industries are not doing so.

The challenge, Chenfei said, is designing carbon pricing policies that can withstand those pressures.

What comes next

When asked what gives them hope, the postdocs pointed to the mounting pressure itself. Climate change and surging energy demand are tightening constraints on engineers and policymakers alike. But those same pressures are also accelerating innovation and forcing hard choices.

“The stakes are higher than ever to drive down the green premium,” said Jackie. “But diamonds are made under pressure, and I’m betting on innovation.”

As Jackie begins her faculty career and Chenfei continues her fellowship at Stanford, their conversation underscores that reaching net zero will depend not on one lever, but many, pulled in concert by all kinds of people.",https://energy.stanford.edu/sites/energy/files/styles/large/public/media/image/chenfei_jackie_filter_960_x_640_1.jpg?itok=MCw58-Zo,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:40.215257

Most of the health benefits are concentrated in a small number of urban counties, while some rural areas bear significant costs with few benefits.","Most of the claimed benefits of federal regulation stem from air quality controls. Between 2006 and 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accounted for 71 percent of the monetized benefits and 55 percent of the costs of all major federal regulations. Of those benefits, 95 percent came from air quality rules, primarily those targeting fine particulate matter (PM2.5), microscopic airborne particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.

Thus, the EPA decision to no longer quantify the benefits of PM2.5 emission reduction is important. The rationale offered by the EPA is “the E.P.A.’s analytical practices often provided the public with false precision and confidence regarding the monetized impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone.”

What do we know about the benefits of PM2.5 reduction? David Kemp and I examined the issue last year. The central problem is that our estimates of the mortality risks associated with PM2.5 exposure rely on observational studies. Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for demonstrating cause and effect, are not feasible. Instead, researchers rely on statistical methods that remain vulnerable to unobserved and unmeasured alternative causes of mortality other than PM2.5 exposure.

Despite these limitations, such studies continue to underpin federal standards. The EPA also assumes there is no safe threshold for PM2.5 exposure. This assumption is highly contested and may exaggerate the estimated benefits of regulation. In addition, the EPA treats PM2.5 as a uniform substance, even though it includes a wide range of particles with different levels of toxicity.

For example, coal ash or diesel exhaust may be far more harmful than dust from unpaved roads, but current standards treat them all equally. This one-size-fits-all approach can result in too little regulation in some areas and too much in others.

The costs and benefits of regulation are also unevenly distributed. Most of the health benefits are concentrated in a small number of urban counties, while some rural areas bear significant costs with few benefits. When scientific uncertainty and regional variation are taken into account in the analysis, PM2.5 regulation may result in negative net benefits in many parts of the country.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2025-07/air%20quality%20.jpg?itok=EgL2RTV_,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:25.981443

In the opening weeks of 2026, Tesla Inc. has reasserted its grip on the U.S. electric vehicle market, capitalizing on the abrupt end of federal incentives that once buoyed its competitors. With the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases eliminated under recent policy shifts, traditional automakers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. are reeling from production cuts and mounting losses. Tesla, however, has seen its domestic market share climb to new heights, driven by its unmatched production efficiency and a loyal customer base undeterred by higher prices.

This shift comes at a pivotal moment for the auto industry, as electric vehicles transition from subsidized novelty to mainstream necessity. Data from recent reports indicate that Tesla delivered over 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2025, though its U.S. sales have surged in the absence of incentives. Competitors, reliant on government support to make their EVs price-competitive, are now facing a stark reality: without those crutches, their offerings struggle to attract buyers in a cost-conscious environment.

Analysts point to Tesla’s vertical integration—controlling everything from battery production to software updates—as a key advantage. Unlike rivals who outsource critical components, Tesla can scale operations without the same profit erosion. This has allowed the company to maintain pricing power, even as overall EV demand softens amid economic headwinds.

The Incentive Vacuum and Its Immediate Fallout

The elimination of federal EV tax credits, effective at the start of 2026, has exposed vulnerabilities in the strategies of legacy carmakers. Ford, for instance, has scaled back production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup, citing unprofitable sales without subsidies. Similarly, GM has paused expansions at its battery plants, with executives admitting that EV margins are “underwater” in the current climate.

According to a report from Business Insider, Tesla’s U.S. market share has soared to approximately 60% in the first quarter of 2026, up from 50% just a year prior. This resurgence echoes Tesla’s early dominance before incentives leveled the playing field for newcomers. The article highlights how Tesla’s focus on high-volume models like the Model Y and Model 3 allows it to absorb cost pressures better than competitors juggling diverse lineups.

Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, reflect growing sentiment among industry watchers that Tesla’s scale is its ultimate weapon. Users have noted how rivals’ EV programs, once propped up by incentives, now face existential threats, with some predicting further market consolidation.

Competitors’ Struggles in a Post-Subsidy World

European and Asian automakers aren’t faring much better in the U.S. Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which relied on incentives to push luxury EVs, have reported double-digit sales declines. Rivian Automotive Inc., a darling of the startup scene, has slashed its 2026 production targets by 20%, blaming the incentive loss for eroding consumer interest in its higher-priced trucks and SUVs.

A deeper look reveals structural issues. Many competitors entered the EV space with ambitious plans but lacked Tesla’s cost discipline. For example, Volkswagen AG’s ID.4 SUV, once a strong seller with tax credits, now sits on dealer lots longer, leading to aggressive discounting that further squeezes margins. Industry data from Cox Automotive shows EV inventory levels rising 15% year-over-year, a sign of oversupply without demand stimulants.

Tesla, by contrast, has leveraged its Gigafactories to drive down per-unit costs. Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, has publicly touted this efficiency, stating in recent earnings calls that Tesla’s profitability per vehicle remains robust even without subsidies. This narrative is supported by financial analyses suggesting Tesla’s gross margins on EVs hover around 25%, compared to single-digit or negative figures for many rivals.

Global Contrasts and Domestic Dominance

While Tesla thrives domestically, its global position tells a different story. China’s BYD Co. overtook Tesla as the world’s top EV seller in 2025, delivering over 3 million units, according to reports from The New York Times. The piece details how BYD’s affordable models and massive home-market scale allowed it to surge ahead, even as Tesla grappled with competition in Europe and Asia.

Yet in the U.S., protective tariffs and regulatory barriers have shielded Tesla from BYD’s full onslaught. American policies restricting Chinese imports mean BYD’s low-cost vehicles aren’t flooding showrooms here, allowing Tesla to consolidate its lead. This dynamic underscores a bifurcated market: global fragmentation versus U.S. concentration.

Analysts from Reuters, in a piece on Tesla’s quarterly deliveries (Reuters), note that while Tesla’s overall sales dipped 9% annually due to international pressures, its U.S. performance bucked the trend. The report raises questions about Musk’s pivot to robotaxis and AI, but affirms that core auto operations remain resilient stateside.

Strategic Pivots and Future Trajectories

As competitors regroup, some are shifting toward hybrids to bridge the gap. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., long skeptics of full electrification, are seeing hybrid sales boom, capturing market segments where pure EVs falter without incentives. This hybrid resurgence, detailed in insights from Fastmarkets (Fastmarkets), could alter steel demand and supply chains, as hybrids require different materials than battery-heavy EVs.

Tesla, undeterred, is doubling down on innovation. The company plans to launch an updated Model 2, a more affordable compact aimed at broadening appeal. Musk has hinted at integrating advanced autonomy features, potentially justifying premium pricing in a subsidy-free era.

Industry insiders speculate this could further entrench Tesla’s position. A CarPro analysis (CarPro) emphasizes how Tesla’s loss of the global crown to BYD highlights rapid market changes, but in the U.S., the absence of incentives amplifies Tesla’s manufacturing edge.

Consumer Sentiment and Market Realities

Buyer behavior is evolving too. Without tax credits, affordability becomes paramount, favoring Tesla’s established ecosystem of Superchargers and over-the-air updates. Surveys indicate that 70% of recent EV purchasers cite range anxiety and charging infrastructure as top concerns, areas where Tesla excels.

Posts on X capture this enthusiasm, with users praising Tesla’s real-world usability over competitors’ promises. One thread discusses how Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, once a threat, now lags in software reliability, driving owners back to Tesla.

Moreover, economic factors like rising interest rates are making financed EV purchases less attractive, hitting incentive-dependent models hardest. Tesla’s direct-to-consumer sales model bypasses dealer markups, offering another layer of cost control.

Regulatory Ripples and Industry Adaptation

Policy changes extend beyond incentives. The Biden administration’s prior push for electrification has given way to a more hands-off approach, leaving automakers to navigate emissions standards without fiscal carrots. This has prompted lobbying efforts from GM and Ford for reinstated supports, but political gridlock suggests little relief soon.

TechCrunch’s coverage of Tesla’s sales decline globally (TechCrunch) contrasts this with U.S. gains, attributing the domestic boost to Tesla’s brand loyalty amid Musk’s controversial politics. Despite backlash, sales data shows minimal impact on core buyers.

Looking ahead, experts predict further consolidation. Smaller players like Lucid Group Inc. may seek mergers, while giants like Stellantis NV reassess EV commitments. Tesla’s robotaxi ambitions, if realized, could diversify revenue beyond vehicles, insulating it from market fluctuations.

Innovation as the Ultimate Differentiator

Tesla’s software prowess remains a wildcard. Features like Full Self-Driving, though regulatory hurdles persist, promise to elevate vehicle value post-purchase. Competitors scrambling to match this often partner with tech firms, adding complexity and costs.

AP News reports on Tesla’s second consecutive year of global sales drops (AP News), yet notes U.S. resilience tied to expiring incentives and competition. The article underscores Musk’s influence, from political endorsements to product pivots, as factors in consumer perceptions.

In this environment, Tesla’s ability to iterate rapidly—evidenced by Cybertruck refinements—sets it apart. As rivals cut losses, Tesla invests in expansion, eyeing new factories to sustain volume growth.

Sustaining Momentum in Uncertain Times

The road ahead isn’t without bumps. Supply chain disruptions, particularly in rare earth minerals, could challenge all players. Tesla’s investments in domestic sourcing mitigate some risks, but global dependencies linger.

Sentiment on X suggests optimism for Tesla’s trajectory, with discussions highlighting how incentive removal weeds out weaker competitors, paving the way for true innovators.

Ultimately, 2026 may mark the year Tesla solidifies its U.S. stronghold, proving that scale, efficiency, and vision trump subsidies in the long run. As the industry adapts, Tesla’s blueprint could redefine automotive success for decades.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-6384-1768373549.jpeg,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:36.305281

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

Where we are

1. Where are we? Well, we are still hurtling toward disaster

We are way behind on emission reduction pathways.

In 2025 it looks like total global emissions were roughly the same as 2024. That’s a small win, but they need to be reducing 8-10% p.a. to meet climate goals. And fossil fuel emissions went up 1.1%; it’s just that land-use emissions were down, partly because of the ending of El Niño.

And we have discovered that a major short-term pollutant – methane – is much more of a problem than we had expected. US ‘natural’ gas, for example, has been booming, but we now find that its life cycle emissions may be worse than coal-fired power; so, while we’ve been shouting “we’re transitioning,” we have in fact been going backwards. Aaargh!

Our lack of progress on emissions reduction means that temperatures have been rising rapidly. We have now breached the 1.5°C threshold that scientists have been pressing us to have as an outer limit, and we're experiencing increasingly severe heatwaves, storms, and floods around the world. This is now going to get progressively worse for the foreseeable future, with disastrous impacts unless we rapidly prepare and adapt.

In the meantime, biodiversity collapse continues apace, with scientists talking of millions of species at risk of disappearing on land and in the seas, on top of what has already gone. One sobering statistic from the animal kingdom: domesticated animals comprise 60% of the world's mammalian biomass, humans account for 34%, leaving only 6% for wild animals — a share that continues to decline.

The challenges we face remain severe. But there is progress.

2. Yet, we have won the energy argument. A big win!

Despite the grim state of things, we are making progress. The impact of efforts to date has been to lower what is the expected maximum level of warming to around 3.5°C. We have “bent the curve”.

That’s largely due to changes in energy use. In 2024, according to the International Energy Agency, over 90% of all investment in electricity generation was for clean energy.

I’d call that a slam dunk.

Solar power costs continue to fall by up to 20% annually, thanks primarily to the production cost reductions driven by China's massive renewable energy deployment — motivated as much by energy security as environmental commitment.

Solar is now cheaper, easier, and faster to deploy across markets from Africa to SE Asia. And, as predicted by our friends at Carbon Tracker, it’s creating piles of stranded assets, like the coal-fired power stations now losing money in Pakistan.

Wind energy, perhaps surprisingly, continues to drop in cost as well. And that includes floating offshore wind! Earlier this month, Japan started up its first floating offshore wind farm, with lots more in the planning (investment that will need a lot of green bonds).

Yes, we still need to shut down all the fossil fuel power generation on the planet – a vast task – and that will require speeding upthe renewables roll-out. But let’s savour the energy win.

3. Electric car sales are surging, and mass transit is growing

That comes thanks again to a history of strong government support in China, where 50% of Chinese cars sold in 2024 were EVs. But this has now spread to emerging markets, with 26% of car sales in Pakistan being EVs, 60% in Ethiopia, 70% in Nepal, etc.

Given the resource and energy intensity of car manufacturing, substituting petrol and electric cars is not the perfect solution; but we are also on the cusp of a broader mobility revolution.

The development that gets most attention is the meteoric rise of ride-hailing services (Uber, Didi, Ola, Grab, etc). Their huge growth in recent years has changed transport habits, with more to come with the imminent morph into driverless cars (already working in some Chinese and US cities). Privately owned cars are generally only driven 5% of the time; as shared vehicle services grow we should expect to see a lot fewer vehicles per capita, with higher utilisation rates; and more space in cities to turn over to cafes and small parks.

The development I find most compelling is with electric two-wheelers. In China they have become ubiquitous; in cities from Chennai to London they are also booming, especially for commuters. In a rapidly aging world, their ease of use is especially useful for older people.

But the development that is having the most impact is the growth of mass transit systems.

If you’ve ridden the subway networks of Tokyo or Shanghai or Delhi you’ll know what the future looks like in big cities. In the past 25 years subway development has been most incredible in China; Beijing, for example, had 54 kms of subways in 2000; it now has 879kms. But this now happening in other countries as well: Mumbai had no subways in 2000; it now has 80kms of them, with more coming this year.

Public capital for subway development in emerging markets like Bangladesh is scarce, but cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong have shown us how to finance mass transit without government subsidies, by using property development over new stations to finance the building of new lines. Expect every emerging market city to be beating a path to their doors.

4. Green and Sustainable bonds are now over USD6tn outstanding — and growing

The climate transition is capital-intensive! Decarbonisation and resilience both involve huge amounts of capital investment to build new kit, like solar farms or to retrofit what we have to make it future-fit, although operating costs are much lower. As well, we have to deliver on economic opportunities for citizens (for example, did you know that in India a million young people join the workforce every month?). To make all this happen we will need to see more than USD10tn a year flowing to climate solution investments.

Capital availability is not the issue. Global investment pools have expanded profoundly over the last 50 years, with the total value of global financial wealth increasing from tens of trillions to over USD305tn by 2024. Immense! It’s just that those pools are not always in the right places.

Except in one area. Ten years ago, when the Paris Agreement was signed, there were only USD100m in green and sustainable bonds outstanding globally. Today it’s more than USD6tn, with demand remaining strong and issuers reaping the rewards.

In a report we published at COP30 we found that, based solely on bonds expected from existing issuers, the next 10 years should see USD17.8tn in global issuance. I.e. that’s without accounting for new issuers, and they continue to appear.

Investors will choose green when given a good chance.

What to expect in 2026

1. Transition finance is building up a head of steam

The idea of transition planning in industries like steel, cement and chemicals has become a norm, encouraged by shareholders and regulators in Japan, Europe and China. We’re now seeing the spread of credible transition plans.

For example, China's Hebei province has issued steel transition-finance guidance, supporting decarbonisation through 176 eligible technologies, including hydrogen-based production. As Hebei produces 11% of global steel, this guidance — which requires steel companies to develop transition plans — sets a powerful precedent. The same guidance requires that the steel companies develop a transition plan.

12 provinces in China, covering a population greater than the US and the EU combined, have now issued transition plans.

Japan’s government has made Green (industrial) Transformation into a major national programme. They’ve even set up a special “GX Acceleration” agency to invest in transition technologies and companies, and are issuing USD10bn of sovereign climate transition bonds each year to finance the programme. The programme still needs work in some places, but every country needs one of these. Japan is moving.

Change is in the air.

2. Resilience finance is growing

As the atmosphere warms, avoiding catastrophic climate change means emission reduction targets get tougher, not weaker. Simultaneously, consequence of past emissions growth have to be managed, including secondary effects on economies, societies, health and nature. They will get progressively more severe over the next 25 years.

We need to prepare.

We are fortunate: we now have unprecedented predictive capacity — the tools to anticipate and plan for rising climate impacts.

These tools are working. In places like Tokyo, for example, where an understanding of climate impacts has led to massive investments to improve resilience to increased rainfall, flooding and storm intensity. To finance that work, late last year Tokyo issued its first EUR300m (¥53bn) Climate Bonds Certified resilience bond; it was seven times oversubscribed!

Banks are starting down this road: last week Standard Chartered Bank issued its first green bond, with a big chunk of the proceeds going to finance climate resilience investments. This mixing of decarbonisation and resilience will be a major part of finance for climate action in the future.

3. Financing the boom in emerging market cities

Last November the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs published research showing that nine of the world’s 10 largest cities are now in emerging markets. Jakarta has nearly 42 million people; Dhaka, the world’s second largest city, has 36.6 million.

Around the world, 33 cities now have more than 10 million people.

In some regions, like South Asia and Africa, overall populations are still growing. But the big issue is the rapid shift from rural communities to cities. The West went through this last century; for example, in the US, in 1900, 60% of people were rural dwellers; it’s now down to 20%. In emerging markets impacted by increasingly severe climate change, volatile weather will make life tougher for small farmers, accelerating the shift that’s already underway.

We need to plan for 80% of people to live in cities by 2050. And those cities will have to be fit for the sort of future we’re heading into.

For a start, they’ll have to be heat-resilient. Severe heat waves are going to become the norm. Large-scale urban tree planting helps, reducing ambient temperatures by up to 5°C, but we also need building designs and materials that will help keep us cool. And to go underground.

They’ll also have to be low-carbon, water-efficient, and denser.

Cities including Nairobi, Montreal, and Reykjavik already run 100% on clean electricity. Transport will be electric, from two-wheelers to ride-hailing to mass transport. Using property development over subway stations to pay for the vast number of subway lines needed will become the norm.

Cycles of drought and flood will become the norm, forcing us to better collect, use and recycle water. Perhaps the best current example is Singapore, which uses high levels of recycling to achieve water self-security.

Dense cities use less energy, are easier to service, and serve as incubators of economic growth. Managing density can help with other objectives — for example, if we allow zero-carbon and water-efficient buildings to have more height (and so floor space) than normal buildings, developers will build accordingly.

But cities will, above all, have to be engines for wealth and job creation. If we’re to avoid slums and favelas that will leave millions at risk of disaster in every severe storm and flood, the millions moving must find livelihoods, housing, and services. Cities are already national engines for national economic development, but rapid growth will require extra effort to absorb people smoothly.

Step change in urban development will take significant investment capital. Tax-based funds are totally inadequate for the work required.

In places like the USA, a robust market of municipal bonds finances urban infrastructure and development; that’s also been the same in China. Municipal finance is increasingly visible in emerging markets — in the last few months, we have seen very successful green bond issuance from Bogota in Colombia, Surat in Gujarat, and from the State of Lagos in Nigeria. Plus green bonds from city water and transport utilities all around the world.

Expect more in 2026.

4. Finance for nature grows

The most common discussion of “nature” focuses on protecting and restoring biodiversity, on land and at sea. While we continue to look for ways of funding forest protection, the bulk of effort will involve government expenditure. We already have, for example, France using its green bond to fund work to protect the rainforest of French Guaiana, and the Australian Government using its green bond for ecosystem restoration in the Great Barrier Reef. Expect to see more of this being included in sovereign green bond issuance in the coming year.

The second focus is bringing nature and agriculture closer together. Sustainable agriculture that supports biodiversity usually requires changes to farming practices, such as the creation of wildlife corridors that Brazil’s Forest Code encourages, or the avoidance of polluting pesticides and fertiliser. Expect relevant issuance to grow in Brazil and in China.

Watch Sean Kidney speak from the Amazon at COP30 in Belém

The third focus is the integration of nature into cities. That will range from greening streets (reducing heat while we do so), to planning wildlife corridors, to preserving wetlands for birds. Expect to see the inclusion of relevant expenditures in green debt issuance from cities and from major developers.

5. Grow climate finance to match the tens of trillions needed

Green bonds continue to get higher over-subscription rates than ordinary bonds, and regular pricing benefit. That leads governments and corporates to ask “could this work for us?”

USD6tn+ is a great start as an indicator of capital flowing, but we need a lot more — more like USD30tn by 2030.

A lot will be new investment, from solar power to resilient water infrastructure in places starting to experience more severe droughts.

For governments it means bringing in policy settings that lead to the creation of more climate investment opportunities.

That might range from better planning for the expansion of transmission lines to bring renewable energy to industry and setting up subway authorities with the powers needed for property development over railways stations, as Hong Kong as done to finance its subway network, to tax-breaks for urban agriculture that improves city resilience and getting involved in ensuring critical minerals availability. The very first and often most impactful step will be reform to fast-track relevant investment approvals.

Programmes will range from the national, like China’s New Economy Plan or Japan’s Green Transformation initiative, to simply requiring water utilities to incorporate robust climate impacts planning into their decision-making process.

It’s not always about new capital, it’s also about making sure what we invest in is future-fit.

The majority of investment we need involves changing the requirements of what we’re already planning to do, from making sure that when we upgrade ports we prepare them to deal with more severe storm impacts, to switching transport investments to electric.

In fact, the majority of what we have to do is to “green” existing capital flows — rethinking what we build and how we manage. Upgrading the requirements for underlying investments will allow bond issuance to be included in climate investment portfolios.

This year we’ll also see bonds related to improving the resilience of everything from physical infrastructure (like Tokyo’s successful Climate Bonds Certified resilience bond late last year) to economic systems.

Emerging transition and resilience guidance gives governments, cities, and corporates a clear roadmap for action.

Thinking past 2026 — it's not just the now

Change doesn’t happen in a linear fashion.

There will be backward lurches, like we’re experiencing in US climate policy right now. We are seeing tectonic changes in the norms of government and politics. They could be teaching moments; that ""Trump effect"" can be positive in one key way — it can liberate those of us working to address climate change to think big, to be audacious.

And there are already big shifts. On clean energy we’re in the middle of a gargantuan shift forward, kicked off by the German Greens introducing a feed-in tariff in 2001, then scaled up massively by China. Thank you Beijing.

Other opportunities will present themselves; and the volume of climate finance opportunities — and climate-related bonds — will grow.

The window remains narrow for reducing emissions and preparing for the climate impacts coming our way. We have to move fast.",,N,,2026-01-14 16:00:00.706985

The launch of domestic manufacturing capacity when complete will represent a transformational expansion of NeoVolta’s business model, positioning the Company to serve the utility-scale and commercial & industrial (C&I) energy storage markets as a U.S. manufacturer.

The Georgia facility is designed for 2 GWh of initial annual production capacity, scalable to up to 8 GWh, and is expected to begin mass production in mid-2026. Located along the I-85 corridor, the facility will initially focus on prismatic-cell battery pack assembly and DC container integration, supporting approximately 89 production personnel at steady-state initial capacity.

This announcement marks a step-change in NeoVolta’s scale and strategic positioning. The Company believes the establishment of domestic BESS manufacturing capacity materially expands its addressable market, growth profile, and long-term relevance, and warrants a closer evaluation of NeoVolta’s opportunity set

Illustrative Revenue Potential

Industry analyses, including from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), indicate that utility-scale and C&I battery energy storage systems in active U.S. markets can generate approximately $200 per kilowatt-hour of installed capacity, depending on configuration and commercial structure.

At an illustrative level, 2 GWh of annual production at an average realized value of $200 per kilowatt-hour would represent approximately $400 million of annual revenue potential at full utilization. This illustrative example is not a forecast or projection and is provided solely to convey the scale of the opportunity. Actual results may differ materially based on product mix, customer contracts, pricing, capacity utilization, market conditions, and other factors.

This illustrative example is provided to highlight the order of magnitude of the opportunity associated with domestic BESS manufacturing and does not constitute financial or revenue guidance. Broader industry forecasts from sources including BloombergNEF, NREL, and Wood Mackenzie project the total U.S. battery energy storage TAM, spanning utility-scale, residential, C&I, and related services, to expand to approximately $45 billion annually by 2030. By establishing domestic manufacturing focused on utility-scale and C&I systems, NeoVolta Power positions the Company to address a significantly larger share of this rapidly growing market.

“This transformative joint venture with PotisEdge and LONGi represents a major step forward for NeoVolta, positioning us as a vertically integrated leader in the fast-growing energy storage sector. By launching domestic BESS manufacturing, we’re directly addressing surging demand in utility-scale and C&I markets, enabling scalable, reliable solutions for grid stability, peak load management, and high-growth applications,” said Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta.

NeoVolta holds a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture, NeoVolta Power, LLC, and will oversee product strategy, commercialization, and customer engagement. Governance is structured through a five-member board of managers, three of whom are appointed by NeoVolta. PotisEdge holds a 20% ownership interest and contributes deep expertise in large-scale BESS manufacturing, equipment installation, commissioning, and production ramp support. The remaining 20% is held by a group of strategic investors providing additional technical and operational support. Based on this ownership and governance structure, NeoVolta expects to consolidate the joint venture’s financial results in its consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP, with minority interests reflected as non-controlling interests, subject to final agreement terms and applicable accounting standards.

Strategic Manufacturing Platform

Initial production is expected to be weighted toward utility-scale systems, with C&I systems representing an increasing share as demand grows. The platform is designed to support multiple system configurations and product formats to meet evolving market requirements.

Strategic Partnership with Global Renewable Energy Leaders

The joint venture brings together three complementary energy technology leaders: NeoVolta, PotisEdge, and LONGi Green Energy.

PotisEdge, a globally recognized leader in BESS manufacturing and now part of LONGi Green Energy, holds a 20% ownership interest in the JV and contributes deep expertise in large-scale battery manufacturing, including equipment installation, commissioning, and production ramp support, based on proven systems deployed internationally.

LONGi, one of the world’s largest renewable energy companies and the global leader in solar manufacturing, is the majority owner of PotisEdge as part of its strategic expansion into energy storage. LONGi’s involvement reflects broader industry convergence across solar, storage, and integrated clean-energy solutions, and underscores the strategic relevance of the JV within the global renewable energy ecosystem.

Together, the three companies combine NeoVolta’s U.S. market leadership and product strategy, PotisEdge’s advanced BESS manufacturing systems, and LONGi’s global scale, execution discipline, and energy-transition vision, creating a domestic manufacturing platform designed for scale, quality, and long-term growth.

BP's low-carbon portfolio also includes U.S. biogas producer Archaea which BP bought in 2022 for $4.1 billion. Citi analysts said they suspected impairments might be linked to this unit.

After taking a $24 billion hit from exiting Russia in 2022, BP - with a current market capitalisation of around $91 billion - recorded impairments of $5.7 billion in 2023, $5.1 billion in 2024 and has flagged around $6.9 billion for last year, according to its releases and Reuters calculations.

'CLEARING THE DECKS'

The company slashed its annual spending on energy transition businesses about a year ago from $7 billion to a maximum of $2 billion as it embarked on a major strategy shift back to oil and gas.

It has also had leadership changes with Meg O'Neill set to replace interim CEO Carol Howle in April after Murray Auchincloss's abrupt exit last month.

""We see this as a first step in new management 'clearing the decks', with the next logical step being to cut the buyback to zero and allow for further de-leveraging in a weaker macro environment,"" said RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria.

BP is buying back around $750 million worth of shares every quarter.

European benchmark gas prices fell 9% in the period, and Brent crude < averaged $63.73 a barrel, down from $69.13 in the third quarter, as oversupply fears hit markets.

BP shares were down 0.7% by 1112 GMT versus a 0.2% dip in a broader index of European energy companies (.SXEP), opens new tab.

NET DEBT FALLING DUE TO DIVESTMENTS

BP expects net debt to have dropped to $22 billion–$23 billion by the end of 2025 from $26.1 billion in the third quarter, helped by divestments of about $5.3 billion, above earlier guidance. The figure excludes $6 billion from selling a majority stake in its Castrol lubricants unit. BP aims to cut debt to $14 billion–$18 billion by 2027.

Refining margins slipped to $15.20 a barrel from $15.80 in the previous quarter. BP’s 440,000-barrel-per-day Whiting refinery in the U.S. suffered outages after an October fire, adding to earlier disruptions from flooding and a major 2024 outage.

Additionally, multiple ‘hybrid’ companies – those that both produce and purchase cells for ESS units – are classified as cell producers in this model.
Especially for the cell manufacturers, this could be due to the larger investment in R&D, with many larger capacity cells being announced recently.
Tesla and Sungrow, being our only two AAA-rated companies in the report, also have the highest Altman Z-score by a wide margin.
Tesla and Sungrow continue to lead the industry with their AAA bankability ratings, underscoring their financial stability and manufacturing excellence.","The manufacturing score mainly focuses on the shipment and assembly of energy storage system (ESS) modules. An adjustment was made to slightly lower the weight of the cell production score due to the industry’s shift towards a more system integrator model. Although this change had a minimal overall impact on each company’s scores, it reflects the trend of many companies in the business thriving over the last year by purchasing cells for their ESS modules.

When examining all companies rated BB and above, the first release of the report indicated that almost 80% of the companies were involved in some form of cell production. In contrast, the most recent release, in Q3 2025, shows that this figure is just above 50%. Part of this change can be attributed to the shift in methodology. However, even prior to this change, there was a noticeable trend; for example, in Q2 2025, the percentage was just over 60%.

Additionally, multiple ‘hybrid’ companies – those that both produce and purchase cells for ESS units – are classified as cell producers in this model. This suggests that even more of the higher rated companies are involved in some sort of cell purchasing.

This will be an interesting trend to track, especially over the coming quarters, as the larger capacities of cells start to be utilised in utility-scale developments, by both integrators and suppliers.

Shipment Trends

Figure 3 shows the destination for own-brand shipments from the top 15 companies across various regions. Just over 50% of shipments go to China, which is expected, given the size and the presence of many leading companies located in the country.

The data also highlights the emergence of new markets in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America, where there are increasing amounts of large-scale projects and therefore shipments. Given that the sizes of the newer projects are only increasing and the large amounts of money being invested, their proportion of the global market is expected to rise even further in 2026.

The Rest of the World (RoW) segment mainly consists of Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries. Australia is one of the largest developing markets, with multiple 1GWh+ sites expected to be completed in the near future.

While the US remains the second-largest market globally, there has been a slight decline in shipment shares over the past year. This downturn may be attributed to a strategic shift by many top Chinese suppliers, who are actively seeking to expand into other regions to avoid some of the current headwinds in the US market, such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, and increasing competition within the sector.

Financial Trends

Figure 4 provides an analysis of the average Altman Z-score for the top 15 companies, breaking it down into its various components. The valuation metric continues to represent the largest portion of the overall score, consistent with our results from last year, but this is now at a more realistic level. Since some companies are still quite overvalued, we have continued to make modifications to certain scores using a Price:Sales ratio. This adjustment aims to ensure the valuation component does not overshadow the other critical metrics.

The Altman-Z score is divided into parts, allowing for a clear evaluation of the three key metrics that contribute to a company’s financial health: Liquidity, Leverage and Profitability. The Liquidity and Leverage metrics are trending upwards, increasing over the last three years in the sample, and profitability is staying around the same level. Especially for the cell manufacturers, this could be due to the larger investment in R&D, with many larger capacity cells being announced recently. These metrics consistently staying positive and rising is an excellent sign for the industry.

Tesla and Sungrow, being our only two AAA-rated companies in the report, also have the highest Altman Z-score by a wide margin. Most companies outside of these two, but in the top 15, lie around 2.1.

As you might expect from a growing industry, the ESS revenue share has increased every year in the sample. However, the scale of growth has been very impressive, moving from a tiny proportion of most of the larger players’ revenues to a solid percentage in only six years. The companies involved have also had revenue growth every year, with the last two years being a much smaller growth than from 2021 to 2023, the majority of this gap due to BYD’s revenue scaling in recent years.

The average operating margin for each of the companies has remained around 10% over the last few years, with it slightly decreasing after 2023, potentially as a result of the decrease in battery prices in the same period. The peak in 2021 comes from a lot of the larger cell-producing companies in the sample peaking in profitability, as a result of lower lithium and higher battery pricing.

In conclusion, the evolving landscape of the BESS market highlights significant shifts in both market dynamics and company strategies. Tesla and Sungrow continue to lead the industry with their AAA bankability ratings, underscoring their financial stability and manufacturing excellence.

However, the rise of system integrators, coupled with a growing reliance on purchased cells, signals a transformative shift in the industry’s operational model. Emerging markets in regions like the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America are driving new growth opportunities, while established markets like the US face challenges from regulatory and competitive pressures.

Financially, the industry remains robust, with key metrics such as liquidity and leverage trending positively, and revenue shares for top companies steadily increasing. As the sector continues to mature, the focus on larger capacity cells and utility-scale projects will likely shape the next phase of growth, making it an exciting time for stakeholders across the BESS ecosystem.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-4.png,N,,2026-01-14 15:00:05.318512

The request, filed with the Louisiana Public Service Commission, is the first time Earthjustice has formally petitioned a utility regulator to probe data center financing, and the group said it believes it is the first of its kind nationwide.

The motion centers around the financing of Meta's largest-ever data center project - a more than 2 gigawatt planned facility in Richland Parish, Louisiana.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved an application last year for the local utility to build three new gas-fired electric generating stations and transmission to power the data center. The original financing structure came with a parent-company financial guarantee that would ultimately fall on Meta, which was the parent company of the site's developer at the time, Earthjustice said.

Under a financial agreement later announced between Meta and its joint venture partner Blue Owl Capital, a newly formed company called Beignet Investors became the new owner of the data center and the parent company of the project's developer, said Earthjustice, which cited an analysis of the deal reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Meta, meanwhile, became a lessee. The new arrangement also allows Meta to exit its lease after four years, instead of an initially agreed-upon 15 years, potentially allowing it to stop paying for energy or infrastructure build-out costs early, the motion said.

""If Meta ends the lease after four years almost none of the costs of the generating station or the associated transmission will have been paid up by Meta at that point,"" said Earthjustice attorney Susan Stevens Miller. Instead, those costs would be moved to customers of the local utility, Stevens Miller said.

Meta and Blue Owl were not immediately available for comment.

Too many workers cycle between low-quality positions, gaining employment but not prosperity.
This status traps workers in lower-productivity jobs that offer limited benefits and weak social protection, reinforcing the cycle of poverty and poor-quality work.
These sectors can generate quality jobs, including for lower-skilled workers, but require infrastructure, stable regulatory frameworks, and access to finance that many countries lack.","The difference? Economic growth. EAP averaged 5.3 percent annual growth during this period, while LAC managed just 1.6 percent, the weakest performance among developing regions and well below the 2.7 percent global average. LAC's poverty declined over time, but faster growth could have accelerated progress further. The path forward is clear: accelerating growth and creating quality jobs at scale are essential to moving more people out of poverty and into the middle class.

The 2025 edition of the World Bank's Regional Poverty and Inequality Update for Latin America and the Caribbean shows that by 2025, the middle class —those living on more than $17 per day per capita—will become LAC's largest economic group at 42.8 percent of the population. Yet the poor and those vulnerable to falling into poverty will still represent the remaining 57.2 percent.

While recent job creation has lifted many out of poverty, this progress is built on fragile foundations. The core issue isn’t the quantity of jobs, but their quality. Labor productivity has stagnated for a decade, while wages have grown slowly despite rising educational levels. Eight in ten poor workers in Latin America and the Caribbean remain trapped in informal jobs, lacking benefits, security, and opportunities for advancement .

Jobs lift people out of poverty, but poor-quality work keeps them insecure. Too many workers cycle between low-quality positions, gaining employment but not prosperity. When workers move up the occupational ladder into higher-skilled roles, their chances of escaping poverty increase significantly. However, structural barriers prevent most workers from advancing: inadequate education systems that fail to meet labor market needs, rigid regulations that discourage hiring, and weak capital markets that deprive productive firms of investment.

These barriers create a poverty trap. In Latin America, the persistence of poverty is alarming: over half of poor households remain poor year after year, with persistence rates reaching 76 percent in Brazil and 74 percent in Peru. Informality perpetuates this cycle. Between 2016 and 2024, informal employment (measured by the share of workers without pension contributions) either increased or remained stable across all socioeconomic groups. This status traps workers in lower-productivity jobs that offer limited benefits and weak social protection, reinforcing the cycle of poverty and poor-quality work.

The World Bank aims to break this cycle by making job creation an explicit target. The goal is to foster dynamic private sectors that unlock opportunities where people already live.

In LAC, three priorities stand out:

First, unlocking investment in strategic sectors where the region holds competitive advantages: agribusiness, tourism, and renewable energy. These sectors can generate quality jobs, including for lower-skilled workers, but require infrastructure, stable regulatory frameworks, and access to finance that many countries lack.

Second, forging stronger links between education systems and labor markets. Rising school enrollment means little if graduates cannot find productive work; skills development must connect to employer needs.

Third, reducing the friction that traps workers in low-productivity jobs: rigid labor regulations, limited credit for small enterprises, and weak competition frameworks that entrench incumbents.

LAC’s recent progress confirms that job creation is essential for poverty reduction. However, sustaining this progress and building a thriving middle class requires higher productivity and better jobs.

The World Bank's role is to help make that transition possible, combining financial resources with technical expertise and convening power to break down the barriers holding the region back. The alternative is sluggish socioeconomic progress, and the region cannot afford it.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/BlogMejoresempleosLAC?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:47.677138

The Compliance Memorandum, nicknamed the Pritzlaff Memo, directs staff to prioritize efficient compliance over punitive measures, supporting the agency’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative and balancing environmental protection with economic growth. The Compliance Memorandum emphasizes that enforcement should focus on obtaining compliance efficiently and economically. We have yet to see how the Compliance Memorandum manifests. These themes are noteworthy:

The Compliance Memorandum does not de-prioritize inspections or other compliance assurance activities; and

The Compliance Memorandum changes the potential set of remedies and EPA’s approach.

Key Changes from Past Practice

Historically, EPA enforcement focused on building robust cases that aligned with compliance priorities and forced regulatory interpretations through enforcement that could withstand litigation. EPA’s case selection often resulted in prolonged investigations, expansive injunctive relief, and noteworthy fines. The Compliance Memorandum shifts EPA’s enforcement focus away from expansive enforcement actions and towards efficiency and clarity to achieve well defined compliance. Notable changes include:

Compliance Over Punishment

The Compliance Memorandum directs EPA personnel to prioritize achieving compliance “in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible.” This includes open communication between EPA and regulated entities throughout inspections and the enforcement process. The increased transparency or “no surprises” framework aims to avoid disputes over process and procedures.

Rescission of 2021 Injunctive Relief Guidance

The Compliance Memorandum rescinds the April 2021 memorandum that encouraged expansive injunctive relief measures such as advanced monitoring, third-party audits, and supplemental environmental projects (SEPs). Under the new framework, injunctive provisions must be narrowly tailored, legally defensible, and directly tied to specific violations. And notably, SEPs are prohibited until further guidance is issued.

Clear and Consistent Findings of Violation

Findings of violation must now be clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. When a respondent questions how EPA interprets and applies the rule, questions will be elevated for review on a national level.

Enhanced State and Tribal Coordination

Reinforcing cooperative federalism, the Compliance Memorandum emphasizes deference to authorized state programs and mandates open communication to avoid duplicative or conflicting enforcement actions.

Compliance Assistance and Voluntary Programs

EPA will expand the use of compliance assistance tools, including proactive outreach, technical training, and voluntary self-audit programs. This reflects a shift toward collaborative problem-solving rather than adversarial enforcement.

Reasoned Decision-Making Using LEAPS Factors

Enforcement decisions must now apply the “LEAPS” framework—Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic impact, and Stakeholder impact—supporting transparency and rationality in case development. Notably, the Compliance Memorandum explains that this framework should be used to act swiftly to limit citizen suit actions that EPA believes “unfairly impact policy through abusive litigation tactics.”

Implications for Enforcement Going Forward

If EPA regional offices follow the directives, we expect more expedient and narrower enforcement actions, driving quick corrective actions. Regulated entities can expect:

Faster Case Resolution: Reducing protracted investigations and negotiations, EPA aims to shorten negotiation timelines and avoid unnecessary complexity by focusing on timely compliance rather than punitive measures.

Reduced Use of Expansive Remedies: Constraining expansive and expensive injunctive relief, EPA aims to limit obligations to the identified violations and a narrower reading of compliance obligations under the regulations.

National Consistency: Preventing EPA regions from enforcing the same regulations differently, the Compliance Memorandum anticipates development of consolidated criteria for violation categories resulting in national consistency and transparency.

More Collaborative Engagement: Enhancing cooperative federalism, the roles of agencies with delegated authorities, and voluntary compliance programs, the Compliance Memorandum directs EPA staff to engage in more communication with both state and tribal partners, and to use voluntary compliance programs to achieve quicker compliance.

What Should Companies Do Now?

Although the Compliance Memorandum portends a new EPA enforcement approach, EPA does not diminish the obligations and importance of investment in robust compliance programs. Maintaining a culture of compliance is strongly recommended:

Review and Strengthen Compliance Programs

Ensure internal environmental compliance systems are robust, documented, and capable of quickly addressing potential violations. Maintain or implement regular environmental compliance audits to identify and address potential non-compliance expeditiously.

Voluntary Audit and Self-Reporting Opportunities

The memorandum encourages voluntary “find and fix” programs. Participating in self-audit initiatives can reduce enforcement risk and demonstrate good faith to regulators. Companies should fully understand self-disclosure programs and their pitfalls before disclosing potential violations.

Enhance Communication with Regulators

Have a plan in place for regulatory inspections, with clear roles and responsibilities defined. Communicate with EPA staff during inspections and enforcement discussions to understand the agency’s expectations, deliverables, and milestones.

Stay Within Clear Legal Boundaries

EPA aims to apply the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. Companies should do the same when interpreting compliance obligations to avoid compliance risks. If there is ambiguity, work with counsel to develop a defensible interpretation and consider seeking clarification from EPA. If companies have preferable examples, communicate those examples in alignment with EPA’s goal of national consistency and uniform enforcement.

Monitor State Coordination

Relationships with state regulators remain important. EPA will give greater deference to authorized state programs, which means state regulators may play an even more active role in enforcement. Companies should maintain strong relationships with state regulators and understand state-specific enforcement priorities.

Environmental Laws

The Compliance Memorandum is a new chapter in EPA’s enforcement approach, but the underlying environmental laws remain in place. Citizen plaintiffs can initiate actions. And states may act more aggressively in the absence of EPA enforcement.

Published Jan 14, 2026 · Updated Jan 13, 2026

By bringing together industry leaders, governments and communities, the World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative is driving shared economic growth, protecting jobs and reducing emissions worldwide.

The World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative has partnered with multiple organizations across 20 countries to advance frameworks that reduce millions of tons of emissions, protect millions of jobs and contribute billions to global gross domestic product.

Industrial clusters often lack governance structures and development strategies that could enable collaboration; the TIC initiative was launched to align organizations across sectors and help them secure support and resources to make gains.

The TIC initiative delivers tangible outcomes across three levels – policy, cluster and project – showing how collaboration can turn strategic dialogue into real-world change.

Strengthening collaboration, delivering low-carbon growth.

Industrial clusters are the cornerstone of economies, generating millions of jobs. At the same time, they account for some of the world’s toughest emissions.

The good news is that they are also where the greatest opportunities for rapid, shared decarbonization lie. With the right framework, these regions can unlock hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions reductions, protect industrial competitiveness and accelerate national green growth agendas.

Now, from France to South Africa and India to the United States, such industrial regions are adopting comprehensive frameworks that are delivering a successful transition to low-carbon growth through the World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative.

TIC is engaging more than 70 global corporations and public institutions, creating unprecedented collaboration in zones such as ports, energy hubs, industrial complexes, special economic zones and eco-industrial parks.

Launched at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) by the Forum, in collaboration with Accenture and EPRI, the initiative began with four clusters: Humber Cluster and HyNet North West – both in the United Kingdom – Kwinana Industries Council in Australia and the Net Zero Basque Industrial Super Cluster in Spain.

It has since expanded to 40 industrial clusters across 20 countries, becoming the world’s largest community of its kind. Approximate data shows that the 40 signatory clusters collectively represent:

877 million tonnes of potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions.

$508 billion contribution to global gross domestic product.

4.6 million jobs protected or created.

What are industrial clusters trying to solve?

Despite their potential, many industrial clusters face shared headwinds. These challenges often include fragmented or absent governance structures and divergent development strategies, resulting in limited collaboration on shared business opportunities.

The TIC initiative was created to help overcome these barriers by bringing together industries, governments and investors around a common plan, through a holistic and technology-neutral approach.

By focusing on the key elements needed to secure funding, regulation and project delivery, it helps clusters move from ideas to action and build a shared vision for transformation.

The Framework: How the Transitioning Industrial Clusters initiative delivers results.

The initiative is built on the belief that four foundational components are essential for sustainable, cross-sector transformation anywhere in the world:

Balanced impact: Advancing economic, social, and environmental value together.

Inclusive innovation: Considering all technologies and processes that can reduce CO₂e emissions.

Collaborative action: Bringing together industry, government, financiers, labour, and community stakeholders.

Coordinated strategy: Aligning policy, financing, partnerships and technology deployment.

“

One of the challenges is that the maritime industry is largely a regional industry supported by hundreds or thousands of companies of relatively small- and medium-sized operators around the world, most of whom do not have the financial strength to make large upfront investments. It is vital that the maritime industry aligns and collaborates with larger-scale industries such as steel and power generation to work out such challenges.

The initiative delivers tangible outcomes across three levels – policy, cluster and project – showing how collaboration can turn strategic dialogue into real-world change. Each level reinforces the others, creating a scalable model that can be replicated across countries and industries.

1. Policy Impact

By engaging governments early, aligning evidence-based priorities and fostering cross-sector dialogue, the TIC initiative demonstrates how industrial collaboration can influence national policies and economic strategies.

For example, in June 2025, thanks to the collaboration of the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the initiative, Malaysia adopted the TIC framework as a national agenda.

Malaysia hosts key industrial hubs, including Sarawak, Johor, Selangor and Penang, which are active in the petrochemical, data centre, manufacturing, semiconductor and Electrical & Electronics sectors. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced the TIC framework as a key driver of green economic growth, skilled employment and carbon reduction.

“

“The government agreed to adopt TIC as a national agenda as it is a strategic move that unites companies and public institutions to drive green economic growth, open up highly skilled job opportunities and reduce carbon emissions.”

—Anwar Ibrahim, Prime Minister of Malaysia”

2. Cluster Impact

At the regional level, the TIC initiative helps public and private partners create a shared vision for transformation tailored to local economic priorities.

For example, established clusters in Malaysia, Colombia and Pakistan include a wide range of stakeholders, including companies, port authorities and government accelerators. TIC-facilitated workshops and partnerships have played a major role, helping leaders co-design industrial ecosystems around energy-intensive sectors.

In Colombia, this work has been instrumental in unifying stakeholders around a vision centred on energy security and decarbonization.

In the country’s largest port-based industrial area, the Cartagena Industrial Cluster, partners – including Ecopetrol, Frontera Energy and Promigas – worked together through the TIC framework to endorse a governance model which merged two existing clusters into a joint cluster, with the Cartagena Chamber of Commerce.

Within this structure, senior executives have collaborated to identify potential joint decarbonization projects.

3. Project Impact

Through ongoing facilitation and collaboration, TIC supports industrial projects to reach bankable, implementation-ready status. This approach can be replicated elsewhere to unlock financing and accelerate the deployment of low-carbon infrastructure worldwide.

One of the first TIC signatory clusters, the UK’s HyNet North West, has reached final investment decision in April 2025 for its CO2 transport and storage system – a milestone that provides a reference point for financing shared energy infrastructure.

Similar momentum is evident in port-anchored clusters such as Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam, as well as in emerging low-carbon industrial hubs around the world.

Get Involved

That’s the finding of a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labour Organization.

The study finds that despite renewable energy installations hitting new highs, jobs in the sector have only increased by 2.3% from 2023, reaching 16.6 million in 2024.

“Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

“Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.”

China dominant

The report found there is uneven development in jobs across the world – a trend seen for the past few years.

China remains the dominant force in both deployment of generating capacities and equipment manufacturing, mainly due to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices.

The research found that in 2024, China created an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, accounting for 44% of the global total.

What's the biggest workforce challenge facing the energy transition?

The EU followed suit with the same total as in 2023 at 1.8 million jobs. Brazil’s renewables employment runs to 1.4 million, while that of India and the US barely grew from around one million to 1.3 million and 1.1 million respectively.

La Camera added that the geographical imbalance of job growth “reminds us to get international collaboration back on track”.

“Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community. This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socio-economic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition.”

Solar jobs stay top

In terms of employment by technology, solar PV is in the lead, owing to the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing plants. The industry employed 7.3 million people in 2024. Asian countries hosted 75% of the world’s PV jobs with China garnering the bulk of the employment at 4.2 million.

Liquid biofuels follow solar PV, creating 2.6 million jobs in 2024 with 46.5% of the total jobs generated in Asia. Hydropower was third with 2.3 million jobs, and wind next with 1.9 million jobs.

Beyond the numbers, the report also stresses the need for more inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce. It states that “a just transition demands that no population groups are left at the margins. The renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives.”

Growing skills gap is putting energy transition at risk

The International Labour Organization’s Gilbert F. Houngbo said: “A just transition to a renewables-based future must be grounded in inclusion, dignity, and equal opportunity.

“As countries scale up renewable energy investments and job creation, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that accessibility for persons with disabilities – who too often face barriers to inclusion in labour markets despite their skills, experience and talent - is built into every stage of policy design and implementation.

He added that this “requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker’s rights”.

“Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice: it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development. By removing barriers to equality and promoting decent work, we strengthen economies and ensure that the energy transition truly works for all.”

India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution is gathering pace nationwide. In early 2025 the country surpassed 5.5 million EVs on its roads and sales are soaring. This growth is not limited to big metropolises such as Delhi or Bengaluru. In fact, the fastest gains are coming from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. The Union government and state governments are rolling out ambitious policies and subsidies to support this trend. Public and private fleets of electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws), three-wheelers (e-3Ws), cars, buses, and light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) are expanding rapidly outside the major cities. Initiatives such as Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME-II), PM eBus Sewa, PM e-DRIVE and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for EV batteries are key drivers, helping improve air quality and boost India’s energy security as the country moves towards its 2047 goal of energy independence.

Booming e-2W and e-3Ws in smaller cities

The India Electric Mobility Index (IEMI) score assesses how the states and union territories are performing in developing the electric mobility ecosystem, including EV adoption, charging infrastructure and electric mobility technology. The states are categorised into frontrunners, performers and aspirants, based on their scores.

Frontrunners: Delhi, Maharashtra, Chandigarh

Performers: Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana

Aspirants: All others

e-2Ws and e-3Ws are leading the charge on city streets across India. These vehicles are ideal for urban and peri-urban travel in Tier-2 cities, offering low operating costs and zero emissions. For example, e-scooters and moped bikes have seen record demand in recent years. In fact, all-India e-2W sales have jumped so sharply that companies are forecasting growth to seven million units annually for the first time. Local markets are responding quickly.

The case of Assam and Bihar

Assam is a striking example: here over 85% of newly registered three-wheelers were electric in 2024. This was driven by state incentives such as waiving road tax and registration fees on e-rickshaws. Assam even launched ‘Baayu,’ one of India’s first app-based electric bike-taxi networks, to show how e-bikes can serve as affordable urban cabs. In Bihar, the state has also seen rapid uptake. Local registrations rose from ~10,000 vehicles in FY24 to ~23,000 by FY25. These numbers show a quick transition to e-scooters and e-rickshaws on Bihar’s roads as they offer low running and high state incentives.

Chandigarh and Punjab

Chandigarh and Punjab in the North have enabled strong actions for 2Ws and 3Ws. Chandigarh, for one, offers incentives for e-bicycles in addition to mass advertising of e-rickshaws. This has led to significant results as nearly 92% of the new 3Ws in Chandigarh were electric by 2024. The city also achieved a 65% electrification rate of its commercial EV fleet. Punjab, in turn, has planned Rs. 300 crore (US$ 32 million) over three years to boost e-2Ws, e-cycles, e-autorickshaws and e-LCVs. It is also installing public charging infrastructure on streets in major cities such as Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala, and Bathinda. These measures are making EVs more affordable and convenient, prompting more drivers in smaller towns in Punjab to switch to e-scooters and tuk-tuks.

Across India

Similar momentum is visible across the country. In Odisha, the state government approved a large EV manufacturing complex, specifically a JSW Group investment of Rs. 4,000 crore (US$ 453 million) for EVs and components. Moreover, the schemes, e.g. interest-free advances for government employees for buying EVs, encourage the state. The far north-east, Arunachal Pradesh, for its part, has already been deploying e-buses in several cities, such as intra-city routes in Itanagar, Namsai and Pasighat. The above examples from Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Punjab, Odisha and Arunachal, proves that state and local measures allow spreading the benefits of electric mobility to every city and corner in India.

E-buses transforming regional transit

It’s not just personal vehicles that are going electric. Public buses, for long the backbone of city transit, are undergoing an overhaul in smaller cities. Historically, India’s nine largest metros (including Delhi and Mumbai) had over 61% of the nation’s public buses, while many Tier-2 cities had very few or no bus networks at all. To address this gap, the government’s PM eBus Sewa scheme is deploying e-buses widely outside the big cities.

The scale of this effort is unparalleled: over 50 cities are currently deploying 10,000 e-buses, with another 20,000 on the horizon. As an example, according to World Resources Institute (WRI) - India, the growth of e-buses in smaller urban centers can be massive and low cost, allowing India to achieve its goals of long-term energy independence. As a result, in the near future, Tier-2 cities will have e-buses that are cleaner and quieter than heavily polluting diesel fleets. This is critical not just for reducing urban pollution but also for curbing expensive fuel imports. By 2047 the aim is to have a predominantly electric public transport system and rolling out e-buses beyond Delhi and Bengaluru is a key step in that direction.

National schemes fuel electric mobility

In order to fast-track EV uptake, the central government introduced numerous schemes. The majority of the funds were set for the purchase of subsidies, charging infrastructure and research and development (R&D) under the FAME II policy (2019-24). FAME-II was allocated approximately Rs. 11,500 crore (US$ 1.30 billion). In 2024, the government announced a new e-DRIVE scheme to provide ~Rs. 10,900 crore (US$ 1.24 billion) to advanced EVs. Meanwhile, the PM eBus Sewa scheme earmarks roughly Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.27 billion) to finance 10,000 e-city buses in 169 cities. It covers not only vehicle purchase but also up to 10 years of operating support via public-private partnerships.

Another cornerstone is the PLI scheme for advanced battery cells. This Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.05 billion) programme aims to build domestic battery manufacturing capacity. Together with policy push for charging infrastructure, these measures are turning India into a global EV hub. As NITI Aayog notes, schemes such as FAME and the PLI for battery cells underscore our resolve to localise electric mobility. In summary, the government’s concerted push through generous subsidies, targets and industry incentives is creating a favourable climate for EVs to thrive beyond the big cities.

The impact

The transition to electric mobility in India has clear benefits. EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, cutting harmful pollutants in crowded towns. This improves air quality and public health in smaller cities as much as in big ones. Beyond local clean air, EVs help India’s energy strategy. Road transport accounts for ~13.5% of India’s energy-related emissions. Electrifying vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions over time and allows India to shift away from imported oil to domestic clean power. As analysts note, EVs are a “critical pathway” for decarbonising transport and enhancing energy security.

Government data and expert projections suggest these positive impacts are accelerating. For example, electric mobility is already helping India edge closer to its target of 30% EV share by 2030. Industry projections estimate India’s EV stock could exceed 17 million vehicles by 2030 under current policies. The rapid growth in Tier-2 cities is vital to meeting these national goals. Every e-auto and e-bus in a small city adds to the big picture of sustainability. With continued expansion of central programmes and state incentives, India’s secondary cities are poised to mirror or even surpass the EV success seen in its big metros. The country is moving steadily toward a future where clean, affordable EVs connect not just New Delhi and Bengaluru, but every town and city across India.

FAQs

What is the FAME-II scheme?

FAME-II is a national subsidy programme (2019-24) designed to boost EV uptake. It provided financial incentives for purchasing EVs and building charging infrastructure, with an outlay of about Rs. 11,500 crore (US$ 1.30 billion).

What does the PM eBus Sewa scheme do?

PM eBus Sewa is a government initiative launched in 2023–24 to put 10,000 e-buses into service in cities across India. It allocates ~Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.27 billion) for buying and operating e-buses in 169 cities.

Which cities and states are leading in EV adoption?

While major metros are well known, many smaller cities and states have become EV leaders. For instance, Chandigarh achieved a 91.8% electrification rate for new 3Ws in 2024. Assam recorded over 85% of new autorickshaws as electric. Punjab, Odisha, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, and Arunachal Pradesh have all launched special EV policies or incentives.

Why are e-2Ws and e-3Ws popular in smaller cities?

E-2Ws and e-3Ws are well-suited to India’s smaller urban centres. They cost less to run per kilometre than petrol vehicles, often have lower service needs and benefit from state incentives. In many Tier-2 towns, riders of e-scooters save substantially on fuel and maintenance. This practical benefit, plus government support.

What benefits do EVs bring to secondary cities?

EVs offer cleaner air and quieter streets, directly improving urban living standards. Fewer tailpipe emissions mean lower levels of smog and pollution. Over time, widespread EV adoption in smaller cities can shrink carbon footprints and contribute to India’s climate goals.",,N,,2026-01-14 19:00:10.712946

Once a global leader in producing solar panels and semiconductors, the United States saw that capacity erode due to domestic policy choices and international developments.","The clean economy stands at a critical turning point. Global investments in next-generation technologies are surging, and the Biden administration put the United States in a position to lead. Since 2021, Congress has enacted three landmark laws—the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS), and the Inflation Reduction Act—to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and invest in emerging sectors that create good-paying jobs. These measures contained flaws, including slow implementation and insufficient checks on anti-union activity by companies benefiting from public funds, but they were delivering results. Billions in federal funding sparked over a trillion dollars in private investment and generated hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs. But unfortunately, the Trump administration is now working aggressively to reverse this progress, threatening the United States’ ability to compete in the global market.

In July, President Donald Trump signed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” repealing nearly $550 billion in funding that would have supported clean energy investments. In addition to that repealed funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also canceled hundreds of contracted awards worth $11 billion for domestic manufacturing, innovation, and decarbonization projects. DOE Secretary Chris Wright led the efforts to halt these clean energy and manufacturing projects. The problem isn’t just the sheer amount of canceled federal funding—it’s that these dollars were driving private investment into critical sectors and delivering benefits to communities nationwide.

Canceling projects will eliminate jobs in emerging sectors; prevent existing industries from adopting advanced technologies and preserving jobs; and squander the opportunity to build a next generation industrial ecosystem in the United States. This story has played out before. Once a global leader in producing solar panels and semiconductors, the United States saw that capacity erode due to domestic policy choices and international developments. Recent efforts to reshore these sectors underscore how challenging it is to rebuild industries once they’ve been lost. Even more troubling, these actions follow a clear pattern: the Trump administration repeatedly canceled legally obligated funding for projects finalized under the Biden administration, relying on flimsy or outright illegal rationales. Moreover, the administration has not disclosed the criteria it uses to review projects. Members of Congress have raised concerns that decisions to cancel projects were made entirely by a small group of political appointees, “based on nothing more than a one-page summary memo for each project, drafted by yet another political appointee.” These actions undermine faith in the public sector, inflict material harm on companies that held signed agreements, and diminish the public sector’s ability to partner with strategic industries in the future.

But the legislation also reveals how far Washington remains from treating development finance as a fully realized instrument of American power.","Tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act is the reauthorization of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), an agency that sits at the intersection of development, foreign policy, and industrial competition. On paper, the reauthorization signals ambition. It expands the DFC’s balance sheet and broadens where it can operate, reflecting rare bipartisan agreement that development finance is a core instrument of American power.

What the statute does not resolve is whether the United States is prepared to use that instrument effectively.

Strategic competition today is increasingly waged through finance—decisions about which infrastructure gets built, which technologies scale, and which firms and standards shape global markets. In that contest, speed, scale, and institutional confidence matter as much as formal authority. The DFC was created to compete in precisely this space. Whether its reauthorization equips it to do this—or entrenches a model that favors caution over action—is less clear.

The China Challenge

Development finance is neither traditional foreign aid nor purely commercial investment. It uses public financial tools—loans, guarantees, equity, and insurance—to mobilize private capital in markets where political risk, weak institutions, or long time horizons deter investment. Development finance aims to help countries build infrastructure, expand productive capacity, and integrate into global supply chains—while simultaneously advancing the strategic interests of the sponsoring state.

Congress created the DFC in 2018 in response to China’s growing use of state-backed finance as a geopolitical and industrial tool. By that point, Beijing was financing ports, power plants, rail lines, data networks, and mines across much of the world—often faster and on terms Western institutions were unwilling or unable to match. For many governments, China’s model proved attractive precisely because it moved quickly, with few due diligence requirements, and often bundled capital with construction. These investments also tied countries into Chinese technology, entrenched Chinese firms, and embedded long-term dependencies into the physical and digital infrastructure of a country’s growth.

China’s model carries well-documented risks. Research has linked a substantial share of Beijing-financed projects to corruption, labor abuses, environmental damage, and debt distress. Yet these liabilities coexist with an uncomfortable reality for Washington: In many contexts, Chinese finance is the only option able to move at the speed and scale required to meet infrastructure needs.

Through the DFC, Congress sought to offer countries a credible alternative—one that was principled but also competitive.

The DFC’s Early Record and Enduring Challenges

Since becoming operational in 2019, the DFC has established itself as a consequential tool of American power. Its portfolio has grown rapidly, reaching nearly $49 billion. The agency now operates in over 100 countries and has established a modest overseas footprint across Africa, the Indo-Pacific, and Latin America. It has supported critical minerals projects, solar manufacturing using U.S. technologies, and vaccine production abroad. For a relatively young institution with just over 500 staff, these gains are impressive.

Yet since its inception, the DFC has struggled to resolve a more fundamental question: What, precisely, is its core identity and purpose? The agency has a dual mandate—to advance both development and foreign policy—but the balance of those two goals is contested in execution. Development advocates have emphasized poverty reduction and development impact. China hawks have pressed for investments that prioritize geopolitical objectives. Subsequently, each administration has reinterpreted the agency’s purpose, producing strategic drift rather than cumulative direction.

That ambiguity is reinforced by an operating model designed to minimize error rather than to compete effectively. The DFC is subject to multiple, and oftentimes redundant, layers of internal review, interagency consultation, and congressional reporting. These safeguards help ensure accountability, high standards, and the responsible oversight of taxpayer dollars. But in practice, they bias the institution toward minimizing failure rather than maximizing impact. The result is an agency unable to move quickly or absorb calculated risk, even in sectors where timing determines long-term outcomes.

The reauthorization attempts to address some of these challenges, particularly around scale and strategic focus. Yet by adding new procedural handcuffs, the legislation also reflects congressional anxiety about executive discretion—unease that reinforces the very patterns of risk avoidance and slow decision-making that have limited the DFC’s effectiveness.

The Reauthorization’s Advances

The reauthorization’s most consequential change to the DFC is to the agency’s scale. Congress raised the DFC’s maximum contingent liability, or portfolio investment cap, from $60 billion to $205 billion, bringing the agency’s balance sheet closer to its strategic ambitions. This expansion recognizes that competition with China depends on scale: The DFC must be able to shape markets and support sustained private investment over time.

The legislation also broadens the DFC’s geographic scope by authorizing investment in high-income countries. This change reflects a bipartisan recognition that the World Bank’s income classifications, based on per-capita gross national income, are poorly suited to contemporary realities. Some projects critical to supply chains, energy transition, and digital and transportation infrastructure may be located in countries deemed “high income” but that nonetheless fail to attract private capital on purely commercial terms. Allowing the DFC to operate in these contexts brings its authority closer to strategic needs.

In addition, the legislation elevates the agency’s strategic focus. It establishes a chief strategic officer, who will sit alongside the existing chief development officer, to advise on national security and foreign policy matters. It includes a “Sense of Congress” encouraging the agency to prioritize critical minerals and telecommunications infrastructure. It authorizes additional positions for specialized expertise and requires a five-year strategic priorities plan.

These changes demonstrate real congressional interest in making the DFC a more ambitious and impactful player, particularly in strategic sectors. However, other changes underscore a persistent reluctance to trust the institution to exercise that ambition with flexibility and speed.

What the Reauthorization Leaves Unresolved

This reluctance is most evident in the legislation’s treatment of high-income country investments. Congress authorizes the DFC to operate in high-income countries, but only following a dense thicket of advanced reporting, certifications, and notifications. Each year, the agency must submit a report identifying the high-income countries it anticipates supporting and the types of projects it expects to finance. If a project falls outside of that report, the DFC must submit an additional notification explaining how it advances U.S. foreign policy. The DFC must further certify that each project in a high-income country is the preferred alternative to foreign adversaries or furthers U.S. strategic interests, among other requirements. Transactions exceeding $20 million trigger yet another congressional notification. None of these requirements operate in isolation. Each entails weeks, often months, of internal coordination and clearance before a notification, certification, or report can proceed to Congress for review.

In theory, this sequencing preserves congressional oversight while enabling investments in more of the world. In practice, it risks rendering the new authority marginally useful. Companies seeking DFC support already face uncertainty associated with prolonged reviews and open-ended congressional scrutiny, even for modest projects. The manifold procedural layers introduced by the reauthorization will likely deepen that hesitation. As one senior congressional staffer told Devex, “[W]e will need to scrutinize every single investment the DFC makes under this administration, especially in high-income countries.” That impulse for control is politically satisfying in the short term. Over the DFC’s seven-year reauthorization period, however, it may erode the agency’s strategic ambition and undercut the rationale for extending the authority in the first place.

The creation of new advisory councils reinforces this pattern. The legislation establishes both a development finance advisory council and a congressional strategic advisory group, each requiring periodic consultation. The latter—composed of a subset of members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees—functionally duplicates Congress’s existing powers to request briefings, convene hearings, and legislate. What it adds instead is time and process. Its creation reflects institutional mistrust—an effort to legislate consultation following the marked decline in the Trump administration’s engagement with Congress. But legislating new advisory processes does not repair the damaged norms around the separation of powers. In some sense, it codifies that dysfunction.

The modest changes to congressional notification thresholds illustrate the same mismatch between ambition and execution. Congress raised the dollar amount that triggers congressional notification from $10 million to $20 million—a meaningful but limited adjustment that still captures a substantial share of the DFC’s portfolio. Meanwhile, speed remains China’s enduring advantage. Research shows that Chinese government-financed infrastructure projects on average reach completion in less than three years, compared to five to 10 years for similar projects financed by the World Bank and regional development banks. That differential creates powerful first-mover advantages and aligns with the political incentives of governing elites facing short electoral cycles. Officials across the developing world have repeatedly cited speed and certainty as central reasons for choosing Beijing over slower-moving alternatives. The reauthorization does not address this fundamental challenge. It may, in fact, make the problem worse.

The treatment of equity illustrates similar tensions. The law creates a $5 billion revolving equity fund, which appropriators would need to capitalize over several years, allowing the DFC to recycle returns on successful investments over time rather than returning them to the Treasury. Equity authority matters because it allows the agency to take ownership stakes in companies or projects, shaping early-stage markets, supporting technology deployment, and participating in growth when projects succeed. Yet budget scoring rules treat equity investments as total losses, rather than their expected cost to the government over the life of the investment. For instance, a $10 million equity investment that yields $20 million five years later must still be recorded as a $10 million loss. The revolving fund may expand the pool of capital available for equity investments over the long term, but it does not correct this underlying distortion. As a result, one of the DFC’s most valuable tools remains artificially constrained.

Political risk insurance presents a parallel case. One of the DFC’s most effective instruments for mobilizing private capital in difficult environments, political risk insurance continues to be hampered by budgetary interpretations that inflate its apparent cost to taxpayers. Congress chose not to address this issue, despite substantial historical evidence that political risk insurance has generated net returns rather than losses. Ultimately, this leaves one of the DFC’s most important tools far short of its potential.

The reauthorization also avoids the question of government-to-government, or sovereign, lending. The reauthorization requires the DFC to establish a clear policy governing investments involving state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds, and other parastatal entities—an important measure given the authority’s limited use and confusion within the U.S. government. But Congress stopped short of authorizing direct sovereign lending. In many parts of the world, the state remains the principal economic actor, with public financing driving 80 percent of infrastructure investments. The limitation on sovereign lending creates a self-imposed strategic vulnerability, preventing the United States from matching the flexibility of partners like Japan and Australia, which routinely finance governments to secure their interests.

Finally, Congress declined to make the DFC permanent. Congress allowed the DFC’s authorization to lapse in October, failing to meet its own statutory deadline, and signaling the fragility of an institution meant to finance long-term projects. China’s policy banks are permanent. So are peer institutions in Japan, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Their permanence strengthens their credibility with both partner governments and the private sector. The DFC’s impermanence creates uncertainty about whether the institution will exist over the long term or whether political winds might eliminate it entirely. That uncertainty undermines the agency’s competitive position.

* * *

The DFC’s early years have demonstrated real promise, and its reauthorization reflects bipartisan enthusiasm for expanding its role. But the legislation also reveals how far Washington remains from treating development finance as a fully realized instrument of American power.

The gap between aspiration and execution runs throughout the statute. Guardrails driven by short-term political concerns have narrowed the utility of new authorities. Two of the agency’s most catalytic tools—equity and political risk insurance—remain handicapped by faulty budget rules. The prohibition on sovereign lending leaves the DFC limited in strategic sectors where public borrowing is standard. And the DFC’s temporary status continues to undermine confidence in investors and partners.

The reauthorization is a step forward, but it falls short of the destination. America’s success in shaping critical infrastructure, technologies, and supply chains hinges on whether our public institutions are built for competition rather than caution. Achieving this will require removing redundant controls, tolerating calculated risk, and adopting a longer view of American power—one that extends beyond the cycles of short-term politics.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/u-s-flag-finance.jpg?sfvrsn=52274c25_5,N,,2026-01-14 12:00:44.375811

New energy infrastructure will reduce fuel costs, maximize 40% federal tax credits to save customers money

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy has brought on line a 50-megawatt, four-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) at its former Allen coal plant on Lake Wylie, serving customers in North Carolina and South Carolina, and has unveiled plans for additional battery storage and new jobs at the Gaston County site.

What’s happening: The first BESS, at a cost of approximately $100 million, was completed under budget and ahead of schedule, serving customers beginning in November. Final testing is being completed this month. Construction of a second BESS – Duke Energy’s largest, a 167‑MW, four-hour system – will begin in May on 10 acres where the coal plant’s now-demolished emissions control system once stood.

Both lithium-ion battery systems qualify for federal investment tax credits, which will offset 40% of the cost for Duke Energy customers. That figure includes an extra 10% for reinvesting into an energy community; the coal plant retired in December 2024.

Our view: “We’re building new resources to keep the Carolinas’ economy thriving, while reinvesting in a former coal plant community that helped power this region for decades,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president. “Repurposing existing energy infrastructure and taking advantage of federal funding significantly offset costs for our customers while continuing to support rapid growth across the region.”

Why it matters: Utility-scale battery systems are particularly useful for cold winter mornings before the sun comes up, filling the gap before solar generation is available. During low-demand periods, they can also store excess energy – such as the clean power generated by Catawba Nuclear Station just across Lake Wylie – for use during high-demand periods.

Duke Energy plans to make similar battery storage investments in multiple counties across the Carolinas. The company’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, now under review by state regulators, projects the addition of 6,550 MW of batteries by 2035 to protect reliability and meet growth needs in North Carolina and South Carolina. That’s enough storage to power more than 5 million homes during times of peak energy use.

The big picture: Duke Energy’s long-term plan maintains a diverse energy mix, adding solar, storage, nuclear and natural gas generation to meet electricity demand that’s rising at an unprecedented pace. Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years.

Coming full circle: The plan also maintains Gaston County’s legacy of supporting the company’s customers across both states. Duke Energy’s plans call for battery storage at both of the county’s retired coal plant sites along the Catawba River, Allen (1957-2024 in Belmont) and Riverbend (1929-2013 in Mount Holly). Construction of the latter, a 115-MW, four-hour BESS, is expected to begin in late 2026, coming on line in late 2027.

“We are proud of how this site and its people continue to support our customers,” said Bryan Walsh, Duke Energy’s vice president of Regulated Renewables and Lake Services. “Multiple former Allen plant employees now work on our Regulated Renewables team, which maintains and operates the new batteries at Allen and elsewhere in the Carolinas. Duke Energy’s test site for new battery technologies, its Emerging Technology and Innovation Center, is also in Mount Holly.”

What’s next: As part of the company’s rate review now before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Duke Energy has proposed a third BESS at Allen to come on line by the end of 2028, as well as a regional operations, training and warehouse facility for batteries and renewables that could house 20-50 employees. Plans for both are still evolving and subject to regulator approval.

The Detroit Auto Show is underway again this January, bringing with it a mix of modern vehicles, interactive exhibits and test-track experiences for the public. The show, held at Huntington Place in downtown Detroit, runs from Jan. 14 through Jan. 25.

Once famous for major global debuts, the event has shifted focus as automakers increasingly choose to unveil vehicles digitally. These private launches allow brands to avoid sharing the spotlight with competitors and control their messaging to wider online audiences.

Despite fewer reveals, organizers say the event still holds value. More than 40 brands are participating this year. Last year’s show drew 275,000 visitors, many of whom came for a chance to test new cars in person.

“That’s what makes the Detroit Auto Show different,” said show chairman Todd Szott. “You can get up close, talk to the people behind the brands and actually experience the vehicles.”

Ride experiences take the wheel

Interactivity is at the center of the 2026 event. Two indoor test tracks allow attendees to take ride-along trips in vehicles powered by gasoline, hybrid systems or electric batteries. These curated rides offer insight into acceleration, braking and vehicle comfort.

Ford and Jeep are also offering dedicated adventure zones. Camp Jeep allows riders to experience off-road features on simulated hills and trails. Ford’s Bronco Built Wild Experience offers similar rugged terrain in one of the automaker’s signature SUVs.

These hands-on displays are designed to go beyond static exhibits and give attendees a better feel for the cars. Organizers said the interactive features are now a core attraction, especially for families and car shoppers curious about electric vehicles.

A different kind of launch

While the number of splashy new vehicle debuts has fallen, the show’s media and industry preview days still carry some significance. Ford Motor Co. was expected to make announcements on Jan. 14, while the winners of the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year awards were set to be revealed at the same time.

Brands with displays this year include Alfa Romeo, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Kia, Lincoln, Ram, Subaru and Toyota. Visitors will find a wide range of vehicles from concept cars to current showroom models.

Public days begin Jan. 17 and run through Jan. 25. Organizers are also hosting panel discussions, tech spotlights and mobility forums to explore broader issues in transportation and electrification.

A show in transition

The Detroit Auto Show was once the must-see event for vehicle premieres. Over time, that spotlight has dimmed as manufacturers choose standalone global launches or digital events to create more controlled hype.

Still, the show remains a significant platform for connecting consumers with brands. Attendees can compare vehicles side by side and speak with company reps or engineers who are present at the displays.

Automakers are using the event to promote their latest electric and hybrid models, supported by indoor EV test tracks. These tracks provide a chance to feel how EVs perform in acceleration and handling, something not possible from spec sheets alone.

A cultural and community hub

Beyond the cars, the show plays an important role in Detroit’s civic and cultural life. It brings economic activity to the region, supports charities through preview galas, and creates a gathering place for automotive professionals and enthusiasts.

Speakers this year include Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno. Their appearances highlight how the auto industry continues to intersect with politics, infrastructure and economic development.

For Detroit, the auto show remains a symbol of the city’s industrial heritage and ongoing transformation. The 2026 edition may not be filled with surprises, but it offers an increasingly personal and hands-on way for the public to connect with the cars of today and tomorrow.

“This project has always represented unprecedented risk to Louisianans, and from the start Meta has done everything it can to shield themselves from that risk.
""Louisiana ratepayers may have even less protections from the costs of this massive data center than they had just several months ago, which were already severely lacking.","NEW ORLEANS, La. (Jan 14, 2026)—Earthjustice filed a motion today on behalf of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recommending the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) conduct an investigation into the effect of Meta’s new financial arrangement with Blue Owl Capital and its impact on ratepayer protections related to the Richland Parish data center project.

On the same day of the Commission’s approval of Entergy’s application to build 3 new billion-dollar gas plants and related transmission assets, Meta fundamentally changed the financial terms of the project by shifting 80% ownership of the data center complex to a new joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, Beignet, for roughly $3 billion. Beignet then borrowed $27 billion to fund the Richland Parish data center, creating a risky and complex financial scheme that allows Meta to walk away from the data center after just 4 years. The consequence for Louisianans is an increased risk of shouldering the costs of billions of dollars in stranded assets.

The motion seeks an investigation into whether the Commission was misled regarding the financial arrangements of the data center project and recommends the Commission conduct a prudence review to determine whether Entergy knew about the new financial arrangement and failed to inform the Commission before its vote on August 20, 2025. Even if Entergy did not know about the financial arrangement, the motion calls into question whether construction of the projects continues to be prudent.

In addition to the changes with the ownership structure, there have been significant changes to the proposed size of the data center. In July 2025, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the final size of the project will be 5 gigawatts, roughly double the size originally listed in planning documents.The LPSC has an obligation to know and understand the financial structure supporting the data center and its overall impact so it can protect existing customers and the assumptions the Commission made when it voted on this project have been significantly altered.

Below is a statement from Logan Burke, Executive Director of AAE.

“This project has always represented unprecedented risk to Louisianans, and from the start Meta has done everything it can to shield themselves from that risk. The additional distance created by this financial deal is a tacit acknowledgement of that risk, and shows that this venture is really a gamble using other people’s money.”

Below is a statement from Paul Arbaje, energy analyst at UCS.

""Louisiana ratepayers may have even less protections from the costs of this massive data center than they had just several months ago, which were already severely lacking. The Commission must look further into Meta's new financing structure to make sure that the bag Entergy's customers are already holding hasn't ballooned out of control.""",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-14 12:00:36.479438

Entergy’s application under the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program would waive local property taxes on a new natural gas-fired power facility to serve Meta’s operations, according to records obtained by The Center Square. The Titanium Power Station is expected to include two combined-cycle combustion turbines capable of producing 1,500 megawatts of electricity for the massive data center.

Building this infrastructure, which the state has deemed an “investment,” will exceed $2.3 billion. Entergy has said Meta will pay to build the power station and the deal will save ratepayers $650 million over 15 years.

“The new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide,” Entergy said.

The filing comes as Louisiana’s largest utility races to meet the electricity needs of new industrial and tech investments, notably Meta’s data center in Richland Parish and Hyundai Steel’s $5.8 billion hydrogen-integrated mill in Ascension Parish. Both companies have applied for or received approval under the state’s Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption Programs to offset their capital costs.

Entergy has already proposed billions in transmission and generation upgrades statewide to support these developments. Company officials say the utility must expand generation capacity quickly to keep up with rising electricity demand, but also as a means of economic development.

Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs that would otherwise paid by Entergy ratepayers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount.

“The rates are not going to go up, and, in fact, may go down,” Entergy public affairs director Jody Montelaro told lawmakers in 2025, citing Meta’s agreement to shoulder much of its infrastructure costs.

Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration has pushed regulators to fast-track such projects under its “Lightning Speed” initiative, a directive that allows expedited approval for industrial-scale energy needs. Critics have warned the approach risks shifting billions in costs onto ratepayers if oversight lags.

All of them were either awardees or subawardees of environmental project grants from the US DOE.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were the City of St. Paul in Minnesota, Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), Plug In America, Elevate Energy, the Southeast Community Organization and Environmental Defense Fund. All of them were either awardees or subawardees of environmental project grants from the US DOE.

In the ruling, which can be accessed here, the judge mentioned that the terminated grants had a common point, which was that all but one of the awardees were based in states that did not vote, in the majority, for US President Donald Trump in the last presidential election.

“Defendants admit that “[a] primary reason for the selection of which DOE grant termination decisions were included in the October 2025 notice tranche was whether the grantee was located in a ‘Blue State.’” Id. So, Defendants concede that the political identity of a terminated grantee’s state, including the fact that the state supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, played a preponderant role in the October 2025 grant termination decisions,” wrote the judge.

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.

“The administration’s damaging actions violated the U.S. Constitution, foundational American values, and basic decency, and it imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” said Vickie Patton, General Counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund.

In the ruling’s conclusion, the judge ordered that “parties shall file a Joint Status Report by January 16, 2026, which indicates whether Plaintiffs still seek permanent injunctive relief and whether Plaintiffs intend to move for attorney’s fees.”

Houchin emphasized that these investments reflect her commitment to delivering tangible results for Indiana’s Ninth District through responsible infrastructure improvements that protect communities and support long-term growth.","Last week, House Republicans passed H.R. 6938, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act 2026, which makes appropriations through Fiscal Year 2026 and supports efforts to strengthen America’s energy security, secure communities, reduce bureaucratic environmental red tape, advance critical programs and implement President Trump’s America-First agenda.

As part of this legislation, Congresswoman Erin Houchin, Ind. 09, secured nearly $8 million in Community Project Funding for critical infrastructure projects across Indiana’s Ninth District, including:

•$3,700,000 for upgrades to the Brown County Regional Sewer District;

•$2,000,000 for shoreline protection in Clark County;

•$1,250,000 for water treatment upgrades through City of Bloomington Utilities; and

•$1,000,000 for stormwater management improvements in the City of Madison.

“This funding is focused on taking care of real needs in our communities,"" Houchin said. ""From protecting our riverbank to upgrading sewer and water systems, these projects will make a tangible difference for families across Indiana’s Ninth District. We will continue to fight for these necessary resources to return to Indiana.”

“We truly appreciate Congresswoman Houchin’s continued support for infrastructure projects that protect environmental health and safety. The Lake Lemon and Bean Blossom Creek Watershed Project will replace failing septic systems that have contributed to excessive E. coli levels in local streams. This funding lays the groundwork for reliable, sustainable wastewater management that will improve water quality and public health,"" said Clint Studabaker, vice president of the Brown County Regional Sewer District.

Kevin Baity, from the Town of Clarksville, said, “For many years, the north shoreline of the Ohio River has continued to erode, destroying streets, recreational facilities and historical artifacts. We have lost direct access to rescue boats, impacting emergency services. Previous temporary stabilization efforts were unsuccessful, and studies show that altering water currents through Bendway Weirs is the most effective solution. We strongly encourage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to implement similar prevention methods to protect our community.”

“I appreciate Congresswoman Erin Houchin’s support for this critical investment in Bloomington’s water infrastructure.

Rehabilitating aging equipment will improve reliability, modernize controls, and strengthen the long-term resilience of our water system,"" Kerry Thomson, mayor of Bloomington, said.

Katherine Zaiger, director of the City of Bloomington Utilities, said, “Booster stations are an essential component of our distribution system, acting like a heart in the system by maintaining water pressure throughout miles of pipes. This rehabilitation will add Variable Frequency Drives to improve efficiency, upgrade monitoring and control systems, and enhance reliability and cybersecurity, resulting in more cost-effective operations.”

“This project will improve the health, safety, economic development and quality of life for residents of the City of Madison and Jefferson County.

""By allowing designated scholarship granting organizations to offer scholarships to qualified child care providers for preschool students, it should reduce some of the strain on the federal Child Care and Development Fund and enable more Hoosiers to return to the workforce and increase their household income.

Among the list are addressing barriers to work-based learning opportunities, tort reform to help maintain a business-friendly climate and creating additional child care options.

All of the organization’s goals align with its current visioning plan for the state, Indiana Prosperity 2035 (IP35).

A survey of Indiana Chamber member companies at the end of 2025 solidified that the IP35 pillar of Economic Growth, Innovation and Entrepreneurship ranked as the most critical area for the organization’s increased involvement, with the Education and Workforce pillars rounding out the top trio.

“This session, we are focusing on the policies we believe will have the biggest impact on employers, particularly small employers, and can get accomplished in the short timeframe we have,” said Vanessa Green Sinders, Indiana Chamber president and CEO. “What they all have in common is preserving or improving Indiana’s economic competitiveness in various areas and overall business climate. We look forward to working with lawmakers, Gov. Braun and other stakeholders to advance bills that make that happen.”

The Indiana Chamber’s 2026 legislative priorities are:

•Ensure tax conformity or decoupling with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OB3) to maintain Indiana’s competitive tax status.

“Indiana has worked over many years to maintain a tax code that is broad-based, stable and relatively easy for individuals and employers to navigate,"" Sinders said. ""We have and will continue to urge state leaders to take action around OB3 to ensure clarity for taxpayers and ongoing stability in Indiana’s tax system.”

•Enact tort reform to protect those unjustly targeted and improve the state’s business climate.

“Smart tort reform is not about limiting legitimate claims; it’s about ensuring a level playing field, reducing uncertainty and protecting employers who operate responsibly, all in the interest of economic growth,"" said Sinders. ""Indiana has long benefited from a reputation as a balanced, business-friendly state that values fairness while discouraging abusive litigation practices. Maintaining that reputation matters, particularly as competition among states for high-growth companies and innovation-driven investment intensifies.”

The Indiana Chamber is part of the Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, a new non-profit entity seeking state-level civil and tort law reforms, announced in late December and comprised of statewide groups and Indiana-based businesses.

•Establish a sustainable, scalable approach to addressing liability barriers for employers hiring students under 18 years old for work-based learning experiences.

“If Indiana wants to be a leader in work-based learning and grow its own talent pipeline, we must address barriers to participation on both sides,"" Sinders said. ""For employers, too often the obstacle is around liability insurance; we need to determine a long-term solution that is accessible to multiple industries and sizes of corporate partners.”

•Establish framework to enable scholarship granting organizations to serve children aged five and under in childcare settings.

“One of the things we hear repeatedly from our member companies is the need to do more around child care to help families and employers,"" Sinders said. ""By allowing designated scholarship granting organizations to offer scholarships to qualified child care providers for preschool students, it should reduce some of the strain on the federal Child Care and Development Fund and enable more Hoosiers to return to the workforce and increase their household income. Plus, employers benefit from a deeper talent pool to fill their job openings.”

•Provide the option for township government elimination to maximize resources and efficiency.

“We have been chipping away at common sense local government reform for years,"" said Sinders. ""This is the next step in that modernization by allowing township governments that are within another unit of local government to essentially eliminate themselves to better serve their residents. There is support from some of these impacted municipalities to do just that; they recognize the redundancy and want to consider this option.""

•Build on economic development collaboration across the state to continue momentum for initiatives in all regions.

•Enhance workplace safety by allowing employers to act quickly when credible threats of violence emerge.

•Continue to deregulate as appropriate and cut unnecessary red tape associated with environmental regulations.

The Indiana Chamber will publish the next phase of its policy efforts in its Legislative Analysis document later this month. That’s when the organization assigns positions to the introduced bills impacting the business community. Learn more at www.indianachamber.com/policy.

The Indiana Chamber partners with 25,000 members and investors — representing more than a million Hoosiers — to achieve the mission of “cultivating a world-class environment which provides economic opportunity and prosperity.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/madisoncourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b1f849ba-dcd8-11ea-9099-4387d0bdd6af.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2026-01-14 12:01:15.899275

LAFAYETTE, IN, UNITED STATES, January 13, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA), a recognized industry leader in environmental stewardship, has energized a 204-kilowatt rooftop solar project atop its new building expansion in Lafayette.

The system went into service in August 2025 and represents the latest step in SIA’s multi-decade effort to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening Indiana’s clean energy economy.

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power. That surplus is fed back into the company’s operations, creating both long-term energy cost containment and measurable carbon reduction benefits.

The project is expected to offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of supplying the electricity needs of 43 homes. Over its 30-year operating life, the system will deliver millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity, helping Subaru advance its corporate sustainability goals while reducing operating costs of the expansion at its Lafayette facility.

Building on a legacy of environmental leadership

SIA has long been recognized for its leadership in environmental practices. It was the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status and has consistently invested in technologies that reduce waste, conserve natural resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The new solar project builds on that legacy, demonstrating how one of Indiana’s largest manufacturers is using renewable energy as both a cost-containment strategy and a core component of its environmental vision.

Scott Brand, President and Chief Operating Officer of Subaru of Indiana Automotive, said, “The expansion rooftop project completed by Emergent Solar Energy further demonstrates an ongoing commitment to reduce our environmental impact. By expanding the use of renewable energy at our facility, we continue to embrace sustainable technology to help offset our carbon footprint.”

Partnership with Emergent Solar Energy

SIA selected Emergent Solar Energy, a commercial and industrial solar EPC headquartered in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, as its partner for the design and construction of the project. Emergent specializes in turnkey solar and energy storage solutions for large manufacturers and agricultural operations across the state.

Jeremy Lipinski, Managing Partner of Emergent Solar Energy, said, “Subaru of Indiana Automotive has set the standard for sustainable manufacturing in Indiana and the Midwest. We are honored to contribute to that vision with a solar project that will deliver long-term energy savings, reduce emissions and showcase how renewable energy can integrate seamlessly with advanced manufacturing. This project reflects what’s possible when industry leaders take bold steps toward a carbon-conscious future.”

Adam Bolen, Project Manager at Emergent Solar Energy who led the on-site construction, said, “Executing a solar installation on an active, high-volume manufacturing campus requires rigorous safety planning and precise coordination. We worked seamlessly with the SIA facilities team to ensure this array was installed safely and efficiently without disrupting operations.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding and EPA’s Proposed Recission

The 2009 Endangerment Finding — EPA’s foundational determination that GHGs “threaten the public health and welfare” — underpins EPA’s broader authority to regulate GHGs and has served as the legal cornerstone for EPA’s GHG regulatory architecture since 2009. Although EPA’s current efforts to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding are most directly tied to the motor vehicle program, recission could have implications extending to other regulated industries, such as power plants (read more about the recission decision here).

EPA’s proposed rule, now set for final review, contends that the Obama-era 2009 Endangerment Finding relied on outdated science, focused on global rather than localized risk, and was overly pessimistic about temperature impacts. EPA also purports that US vehicles represent a small fraction of global emissions and that federal GHG standards impose “hidden taxes” that raise new-vehicle prices and paradoxically keep older, less efficient vehicles on the road longer. Because subsequent vehicle standards relied on the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA’s proposal could have notable impacts on EPA emissions programs for light- and medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, and, if finalized, could preempt conflicting state fuel efficiency or vehicle emissions programs.

What Happens Next?

Release of the final repeal is expected to trigger extensive litigation and public debate, building on years of controversy over the scope of EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act and the US Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v.

Two wind farms off the west and north Wales coastline have secured UK government funding to supply the national grid, with up to 7,000 jobs expected to be created.

The Erebus wind farm, set to be built off Pembrokeshire, would become Wales' first floating offshore wind farm, following two projects already operating in Scotland.

It is hoped the development could open up a new industry, leading to as many as 5,000 jobs in the next decade.

A second wind farm, Awel y Môr, using more traditional offshore turbines, is planned close to existing projects and will be 10km (6.2 miles) off Rhyl, Denbighshire.

The funding comes from a government scheme to encourage investment in renewable energy.

What is a floating wind farm?

While traditional offshore wind turbines are built into the seabed with fixed foundations, floating turbines sit on large floating steel structures which are then tethered to the seabed.

This allows the turbines to be manufactured and also maintained and serviced on land, then carried on ships to locations further out at sea with higher winds.

The long-term goal is to establish the Celtic Sea as a major hub for floating offshore wind energy. The Crown Estate is currently leasing three large-scale projects, with an estimated 264 turbines to be installed by the mid-2030s.

The Erebus wind farm off the Pembrokeshire coast would be able to produce 96MW - enough to power about 90,000 homes.

The plans by Blue Gem Wind - which is co-owned by the French energy giant Total - include building between seven and 10 turbines, in the Celtic Sea, about 45km (28 miles) off the coast.

While it may sound like a small amount compared to other offshore projects, it has been described as a ""pathway project"" for the Celtic Sea.

But, as it will be the first project to use this new technology in the Celtic Sea, there is currently limited infrastructure, supply chain or workforce in Wales to produce these turbines - which can be as tall as skyscrapers.

In addition, ports in the Celtic Sea are not yet prepared to handle the large-scale infrastructure, with three Welsh ports, in particular Port Talbot, in the running for contracts to develop these projects.

Scotland is already home to two of the largest floating wind farms in the world, Hywind Scotland and the Kincardine.

These will soon be joined by the Pentland and Salamander projects, along with the 560MW Green Volt project, which previously secured funding from the UK government.

Awel y Môr will becomethe first offshore wind farm to be built in 10 years off the coast of Wales.

It is one of six projects around the UK which will be paid £91 per MWH on average for the power they generate.

The Conservatives claimed the deals would not lower bills, but analysts Aurora Energy Research said the prices would deliver a net benefit to bills over the next decade.

Majority owned by the energy company RWE, Awel y Môr will see between 34 and 50 turbines, 10km (6.2 miles) off the north Wales coast, next to the existing Gwynt y Mor windfarm.

This could potentially supply enough energy to power half of Wales' homes.

The company claims it has the potential to create 2,000 jobs during the construction phase.

Becky Gittins, MP for Clwyd East - the constituency where Awel y Môr will be - said the funding decision represented ""a major step forward for... our local economy, and the UK's energy security"".

Aled Jones-Griffith, chief executive of Llandrillo Menai, a local college, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast it would ""bring opportunities to young people and perhaps lead them to consider new career options"" and was especially positive for their Rhyl campus, ""where we have a specialised centre to deal with wind energy"".

Abi Beck of trade body RenewableUK Cymru told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that floating offshore wind farms were ""the new revolution"".

She likened the deal to a ""fixed-term mortgage"" adding: ""The government has agreed a price to pay for electricity, and that price won't change.

""That means it'll keep bill payers' costs down and will make sure we don't have to import more gas - we don't have control over that price.

""We're protecting our own energy security and protecting our bill payers as well.""

Charlotte Wood, commercial manager at Mainstay Marine Solutions which is based at Pembroke Dock, said the announcement was ""hugely welcome news"".

""It's the next big step in securing what we hope will be a strong pipeline of work for engineering companies like ours and hopefully it reinforces the future of Pembroke Port, and other south Wales ports as vibrant hubs of offshore renewables,"" she said.

Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: ""It is a massive vote of confidence in Wales' clean energy industry which is already delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future with the potential to bring thousands more.""

Wales' first minister Eluned Morgan added she was ""delighted"" by the news.

""This demonstrates how Wales is well placed to build on its existing capacity for renewable energy, to reap the benefits of these new projects bringing many high-quality jobs and wider economic benefits to our economy.""

How do wind farms work?

Offshore wind farms work on the same basic principle as traditional power stations - electricity is generated by rotating magnets inside a coil of conductive wire.

But, in offshore wind farms, that rotation comes from the wind rather than the steam produced by burning fossil fuels.

Strong sea winds turn the turbine blades, which spin a shaft inside the fixed box on top of the tower. This drives a generator, producing electricity without releasing carbon emissions.

Because a single turbine produces only a limited amount of power, many are grouped together in a wind farm.

Electricity is sent through underwater cables to an offshore substation, where the voltage is increased before being transmitted to land and fed into the national grid.

With a lifespan of 20-25 years, offshore wind farms are maintained by specialist crews who work from vessels stationed at sea.

The largest offshore wind farm in the UK - and the world - is currently the Dogger Bank Wind Farm, located in the North Sea off the east coast of Yorkshire.

Once fully built, it will have a capacity of around 3.6GW, capable of powering millions of homes.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1a18/live/2c000620-f142-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:00:34.964462

However, the larger scale and greater geographic concentration of the Cogentrix portfolio may extend regulatory review timelines.
Another Big Move for Cogentrix Cogentrix Energy, founded in 1983, is a leading independent power company that develops, acquires, and operates power generation assets across the U.S.
The company owns about 5.5 GW of natural gas generation capacity positioned throughout PJM, ISO New England, and ERCOT.","Vistra Corp. has executed definitive agreements to acquire Cogentrix Energy, a portfolio company of Quantum Capital Group, in a $4 billion transaction that will expand its generation footprint across the PJM Interconnection, ISO New England, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Announced on Jan. 5, 2026, the acquisition includes 10 modern natural gas generation facilities, with a combined capacity of 5,496 MW. It closely follows the Irving, Texas–based competitive power producer’s acquisition of seven gas plants—a combined 2,600 MW—from Lotus Infrastructure Partners in October 2025 for $1.9 billion.

A Major Gas-Fired Expansion

Combined, the two transactions could add more than 8.1 GW of modern gas generation to Vistra’s portfolio. According to Vistra’s November 2025 earnings report, the company operated approximately 43.7 GW of total capacity across its generation fleet, including 6,448 MW of nuclear generation (the second-largest competitive nuclear fleet in the U.S), about 26,000 MW of natural gas capacity across combined cycle, combustion turbine, and steam turbine configurations, 4,570 MW of coal generation, and 1,421 MW of solar and battery storage.

Under the Jan. 5 agreement, Vistra will acquire 10 natural gas–fired generation facilities, including five in the PJM Interconnection, four in ISO New England, and one in ERCOT. Under the transaction, Vistra could effectively acquire 90% of Cogentrix’s portfolio, though Cogentrix is slated to retain its ownership interest in Cedar Bayou 4, a 550-MW natural gas-fired plant in Baytown, Texas.

In PJM, the acquisition comprises a mix of combined-cycle and combustion turbine assets, including the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty combined-cycle plants in Pennsylvania, each rated at 881 MW, and the Lakewood combined-cycle facility in New Jersey (286 MW). The PJM portfolio also includes two combustion turbine plants: Rock Springs in Maryland (740 MW) and Ocean in New Jersey (375 MW).

The ISO New England assets—Newington in New Hampshire (624 MW), Bridgeport in Connecticut (558 MW), Tiverton in Rhode Island (297 MW), and Rumford in Maine (271 MW)—consist entirely of efficient combined-cycle facilities. In ERCOT, Vistra is poised to acquire Altura Cogeneration (583 MW), which supplies both electricity and thermal energy to the rapidly growing Texas market.

Vistra said it is acquiring 100% ownership of all plants in the portfolio, including the remaining 25% interest in the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty facilities that Cogentrix did not previously own. The “Cogentrix portfolio is composed of a modern and efficient set of gas assets that adds baseload-weighted capacity, complements Vistra’s fleet, and enhances Vistra’s efficient generation capabilities,” the company noted. “The portfolio has an average heat rate of approximately 7,800 Btu / kWh and features the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty plants, which are 2016 COD facilities with sub 7,000 Btu / kWh heat rates.”

The company also cited a geographic strategy, noting that the acquisition will expand Vistra’s footprint across some of the U.S.’s most capacity-constrained and fastest-growing power regions. Following the transaction, Vistra said its total generation portfolio will hover at 50 GW of capacity nationwide.

Last week, Vistra also said the transaction aligns with its disciplined capital allocation framework. The Cogentrix portfolio is expected to contribute mid-single-digit accretion to Ongoing Operations Adjusted Free Cash Flow before Growth per share in 2027, and high-single-digit average accretion over the 2027–2029 period, and it will be supported by cash flow from operations and transaction-related tax benefits. Vistra said it expects the deal to exceed its mid-teens levered return target.

“Successfully integrating and operating generation assets is a major undertaking, and our talented team continues to demonstrate that it is a core competency of our company,” noted Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke.

“Our diversified fleet, anchored on natural gas and nuclear generation, will play a critical role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids,” Burke added. “The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we’ve completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate. Vistra continues to look for opportunities that allow us to meet the growing demand of customers and meet our disciplined investment thresholds. We look forward to closing the transaction and welcoming new team members to the Vistra family.”

Vistra Spearheading Growth Across Multiple Fuel Types

Vistra’s Cogentrix transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and certain state regulatory authorities, but the company anticipates the transaction will close in mid-to-late 2026.

FERC’s review under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act will examine competitive impacts, particularly in PJM and ISO New England, where the combined Vistra-Cogentrix fleet will hold significant generation capacity. The commission will also assess whether the transaction adversely affects competition, rates, or regulation, and whether it involves cross-subsidization of non-utility activities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as Vistra’s exclusive financial advisor, with legal counsel provided by Latham & Watkins LLP, Sidley Austin LLP, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Evercore served as exclusive financial advisor to Cogentrix Energy, with King & Spalding LLP providing legal counsel.

As a reference for timing, Vistra’s acquisition of the Lotus Infrastructure portfolio—announced in May 2025 and closed in October 2025—took approximately five months from signing to completion. However, the larger scale and greater geographic concentration of the Cogentrix portfolio may extend regulatory review timelines.

Beyond the Lotus acquisition completed in October 2025, Vistra in September 2025 announced plans to build new gas-fueled dispatchable generation in West Texas’s Permian Basin, an effort rooted in the next phase of its ERCOT capacity expansion to support grid reliability amid surging demand.

And in July 2025, the company received Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval to extend the operation of its Perry Nuclear Plant—a 1,268-MW boiling water reactor located on Lake Erie, about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland—through 2046, in a measure that completes license extensions across all six of its nuclear reactors spanning Ohio and Pennsylvania. During its November 2025 earnings call, the company also announced it secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with an undisclosed customer for up to 1,200 MW at its Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant site near Glen Rose in Central Texas. “We believe this 20-year agreement, which enables our customer to energize up to 1,200 MW of new load ensures the Comanche Peak nuclear plant will continue to deliver power to Texans at least through the middle of this century,” Burke said on Nov. 6, 2025.

Days after announcing the Cogentrix acquisition last week, notably, Vistra unveiled agreements with Meta Platforms to support 20-year power purchase agreements covering 2,609 MW of nuclear capacity from its Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley facility in Pennsylvania—including 433 MW of uprates across all three sites. The Meta partnership, which marks the largest corporate-backed nuclear uprate program in U.S. history, will provide financial certainty to pursue subsequent license renewals and extend operations at all three facilities for decades while adding more than 15% new capacity to the PJM grid.

To fund its expansion while preserving its investment-grade credit profile, Vistra has executed multiple capital markets transactions. The company in October 2025 priced $2 billion in senior secured notes—debt securities backed by pledged assets and ranked ahead of unsecured debt in repayment priority—across multiple maturity dates. In January 2026, concurrent with the Cogentrix announcement, Vistra priced an additional $2.25 billion in senior secured notes to support the transaction and general corporate purposes.

Another Big Move for Cogentrix

Cogentrix Energy, founded in 1983, is a leading independent power company that develops, acquires, and operates power generation assets across the U.S. The company owns about 5.5 GW of natural gas generation capacity positioned throughout PJM, ISO New England, and ERCOT.

However, since August 2024, Cogentrix has been owned by funds managed by Quantum Capital Group, a Houston-based private equity firm that has managed more than $32 billion in equity commitments since its founding in 1998. Quantum acquired the company from Carlyle Group for approximately $3 billion, citing rising demand for dispatchable power.

“We are at a critical juncture in the evolution of the domestic power market,” said Wil VanLoh, Founder and CEO of Quantum, when Quantum acquired Cogentrix in August 2024. “Electricity demand is rapidly increasing thanks to explosive growth in data centers and AI, the reshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification-of-everything. This growth is occurring at the same time our grid is becoming more unstable with additions of intermittent renewable power and continued retirements of coal-fired generation. Now more than ever, we need reliable and efficient power infrastructure. This is what the Cogentrix assets provide.”

Last week, VanLoh suggested the transaction reflected a similar strategy. “This highly successful partnership with Cogentrix highlights the scale and capabilities of the Quantum platform and our deep expertise across the gas-to-power space,” he said. “This transaction delivers a strong outcome for our investors and strategic partners in Cogentrix, including Williams, Trafigura Group, and Carnelian Energy Capital, and reinforces our long-standing belief in the critical importance of dependable power generation. We are pleased to become shareholders of Vistra and have strong confidence in Vistra’s ability to create long-term value through its industry-leading asset base and strategic execution.”

Jeff Ingraham, interim CEO of Cogentrix, said, “Our partnership with Quantum was instrumental in advancing the company and preparing Cogentrix for its next phase.”

A Race to Secure Gas Generation Assets

The Cogentrix acquisition, notably, follows significant consolidation activity in the competitive generation sector and a concerted industry-wide move to secure modern gas-fired generation assets. In January 2025,Constellation Energy—which operates the nation’s largest nuclear fleet—announced a $26.6 billion agreement to acquire Calpine Corp., the country’s largest natural gas fleet operator, creating a combined portfolio with about 55 GW. Constellation reported the deal was complete earlier this month.

In May 2025,NRG Energy announceda $12 billion agreement to acquire 18 natural gas-fired facilities (13 GW) from LS Power, roughly doubling NRG’s generation capacity across the Northeast and Texas. The transaction closed in early 2026 following regulatory approvals.​ Similarly, Talen Energy in July 2025 announceddefinitive agreements to acquire two combined-cycle gas plants in PJM—the 1,045-MW Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and the 1,836-MW Guernsey Power Station in Ohio—for a net $3.5 billion. Both transactions closed in in the fourth quarter of 2025.​

Meanwhile, municipal utility CPS Energy executed two major gas acquisitions in 2025: a$785 million purchase of Talen’s 1,710-MW Texas portfolio that closed in Q2 2024, and a$1.4 billion agreement to acquire four natural gas plants (1,632 MW) from PROENERGY that closed in September 2025.​

According to Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR), U.S. natural gas power sector merger and acquisition (M&A) valuations have doubled since 2024. Scott Wilmot, principal Analyst at EIR, in an October 2025 briefing, suggested that accelerating data center growth, grid electrification, and rising capital costs and supply chain issues are driving “premiums for operating natural gas power plants and transforming valuation methodologies in competitive markets,” particularly in PJM and ERCOT.

Enverus said capital costs for new-build natural gas generation now average $2,200 to $3,000/kW, which reinforces the appeal of existing, high-efficiency combined-cycle assets with established interconnections and capacity market exposure. The firm also noted that investment strategies are increasingly focused on portfolios capable of capturing capacity revenues and favorable spark spreads, a factor it suggests marks a shift in valuation frameworks across competitive wholesale markets.

For now, the valuation premium for natural gas assets appears to be reinforced by capacity market dynamics. PJM’s 2026/27 Base Residual Auction cleared at the federally mandated price cap of $329.17/MW-day, which represents a 22% increase from the prior auction. The organized wholesale market’s subsequent 2027/28 auction cleared at $333.44/MW-day, reflecting prices that would have reached approximately $530/MW-day without a temporary cap negotiated with Pennsylvania’s governor.

In the 2027/28 PJM auction, Vistra cleared 10,566 MW of generation capacity, securing approximately $1.3 billion in annual capacity revenue. Natural gas generation accounted for 43% of total cleared capacity in PJM, underscoring its central role in maintaining grid reliability amid accelerating demand growth.

Likewise, ISO New England capacity markets have attracted robust investment, with 1,928 MW of new resources clearing Forward Capacity Auctions for delivery years 2025-2028. Grid operators across all three markets—PJM, ISO-NE, and ERCOT—project sustained load growth driven primarily by data center development.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/odessa-ector-powerplant-2017.png,N,,2026-01-14 11:01:13.093487

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022.
Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade.
Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.
From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution.","DEQ attributes the decline of air pollution emissions to efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, electric utilities, industry and the public to significantly address air quality concerns over the last 50 years. Statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide in particular reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

• 95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

• 74% for carbon monoxide (CO)

• 71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

• 48% for fine particles (PM5)

• 67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Not surprisingly, North Carolina’s outdoor air quality has improved as emissions have fallen. Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade. Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduced emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls. From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution. The state expects to see further reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles.",https://smokymountainnews.s3.amazonaws.com/media/k2/items/cache/89f71e57b4d5a65174f4d42e6fd86758_L.jpg?javer=2601141102,N,,2026-01-14 11:03:01.869206

That’s a larger increase than last year’s 3.5 million increase, which was also higher than the previous year, showing that EVs keep growing despite unprecedented attacks against them by governments, media and even by automakers themselves.

2025 was once again marked by ubiquitous falsehoods in the media regarding electric cars.

If you spent the year reading headlines, or listening to lobbying from automakers, or political statements by fossil shills squatting in government, you’d think the bottom was falling out of EV sales.

After all, for not just this past year, but over two years now, there have been stories all throughout media claiming that EV sales are slowing, cooling, falling, or any other number of inaccurate words.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Even automakers have reacted to these falsehoods and reduced their EV production plans – even ones which have increasing EV sales and declining gas car sales, and which know will lose billions due to their EV intransigence.

The mildly-informed person might see these headlines and these actions and think that doom and gloom is on the horizon, that the EV transition has fizzled out.

But anyone who bothered to look up one single sales number all year would perhaps see things differently.

Yes, once again, EV sales are up. By a lot.

It turns out, EV sales are actually up. Not only are they up, they’re up by a lot. Though that shouldn’t be a surprise, because they’ve never not been up.

And now, once again, we have more data to show it.

Rho Motion/Benchmark Minerals Intelligence released its annual tally of EV sales today, showing a big jump in global electric vehicle sales in 2025 as compared to 2024.

Globally, EV sales went up 20% to 20.7 million, setting yet another record (note: there has never been a year that a global record wasn’t set for EV sales, because EV sales have never gone down year over year). Any company, especially one in a long-term low-growth industry, would kill for a sales increase that large.

Not only were sales up globally, they were up in most regions. China saw a 17% rise to 12.9 million, Europe rose 33% to 4.3 million, and “Rest of World” sold 1.7 million EVs, a whopping 48% increase.

One region did go down though – North America, which saw a 4% decrease in EV sales year-over-year, with 1.8 million total EVs sold (only barely above the RoW number… a fairly pathetic showing for the market dominated by the richest country in the world).

The drop in North American EV sales shares similarities to what happened in Europe from ’23-’24. When Germany abruptly cancelled EV incentives in late 2023, EV sales dropped significantly in Europe’s most car-buying country.

This dragged down European EV sales totals for the next year or so, even though almost all other countries still experienced an increase in sales. And was accompanied by many thinkpieces about the end of the EV transition, or incorrect sentences suggesting that EV sales were dropping Europe-wide.

And yet, look at that new number for 2025 – European sales were up 33% year-over-year. It turns out, the EV transition is still going on quite well enough, after working through the hiccup from one country.

Does this sound familiar?

Indeed, in the US, republicans just inflated the price of EVs by $7,500, on the way to their goal of sending the US auto industry to China and in response to asked-for bribes from the fossil fuel industry. This led to a big boom in EV sales in Q3 before incentives expired, and a big drop in EV sales in Q4, after they were gone. And just like Germany, we expect depressed sales will remain for some period of time, after which sales will resume rising once again.

Not only are EV sales up, they’re up more than last year

Over the course of the last couple years of false headlines about EV sales, some have tried to suggest that the phrase “EV sales slow” doesn’t refer to the sales numbers themselves, but to growth of sales numbers.

But in fact, the 3.6 million unit increase in EV sales in 2025 is larger than the 3.5 million unit increase in 2024, which is larger again than the 3.2 million increase in 2023.

So, not only are sales up, but sales growth is up. If a unit sales increase gets larger every year, that’s accelerating growth, not decelerating.

And gas car sales are still down

Meanwhile, gas car sales are actually down long term.

Globally, sales of internal combustion vehicles are down about a quarter from their peak in 2017, and are expected to never reach that peak again. The combustion engine’s time in the sun is over, and it has been for a while.

So, to look at rising EV sales and claim a problem there while ignoring – or worse, re-committing – to the falling internal combustion market makes no sense whatsoever, especially in a business with long development timelines.

So of course, that’s what Western auto manufacturers have done.

Western automakers will fail if they commit to a falling market

Throughout the last couple years, automakers have played their standard tune – begging governments to let them poison everyone just a little bit more.

There’s even reason to believe that incorrect headlines about EV sales were an intentional effort by automakers to influence regulations, as argued by Union of Concerned Scientists’ David Reichmuth. By claiming that EV sales are softer than they are, and ignoring falling gas car sales, automakers were hoping to influence governments to soften targets, so that they could save a few pennies on regulatory costs.

Automakers did have some success in getting governments to soften their targets as a result of these falsehoods. The Biden EPA adopted softer exhaust rules as a result of automaker lobbying, and Europe recently softened its EV timeline for a second time, both in response to incorrect claims about EV demand. Expect the same behavior in the UK this year, even though that country is on track to meet timelines.

But those same automakers seem to have gotten too high on their own supply, adjusting their plans to incorporate the misinformation about EV sales that they themselves planted. Many have reduced their EV production plans and re-committed to outdated and unpopular gas cars going forward.

Yet despite their best efforts, EV sales still rise, and gas car sales still fall, as we’ve seen above.

Guess who isn’t doing that? China

This push against progress has at least been true for Western automakers, and for Japanese ones too (the Koreans, Hyundai/Kia, do participate in backwards industry lobbying organizations, but have mostly been clear that EVs are the way to go).

Not so for Chinese automakers. Chinese automakers are charging forward with EV production, committing to produce the more efficient vehicles that the world needs and is demanding. Instead of putting their effort into providing the outdated gassers that nobody wants, they’re making state-of-the-art EVs that are far more affordable to use.

And instead of competing, Western countries have thrown up unwise trade barriers that won’t work to get those countries back on track.

This is why China recently became the largest auto exporter in the world – it planned and competed, instead of playing the same stupid game of trying to stop progress that incumbent industry always plays.

We here at Electrek have been clear about this for years now – automakers should look forward, not backwards, and should stop pushing misinformation about their own sales numbers by claiming that up is down. We haven’t had any special insight here, just the simple ability to compare two numbers to see which one is bigger.

Two months after sticking it to South Carolina by locating its corporate headquarters in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, crony capitalist carmaker Scout Motors – a subsidiary of über-woke Volkswagen – is asking Palmetto State taxpayers for hundreds of millions more of their hard-earned money.

The corporate welfare recipient – which already got a whopping $1.3 billion in incentives three years ago – is reportedly dealing with “cost overruns” at its massive manufacturing facility near Blythewood, S.C.

This facility – which company leaders insist will create 4,600 jobs – has yet to produce a single vehicle. Now, sources familiar with the situation say Scout is petitioning governor Henry McMaster and leaders of the S.C. General Assembly to shell out another $200 million to address these cost overruns.

A massive taxpayer-funded bailout, in other words…

McMaster, ever Scout’s dutiful cheerleader, is pushing lawmakers hard to approve the request – although he is reportedly encountering stiff resistance across both the partisan and ideological spectrum.

“Not just ‘no,’ hell no!” one lawmaker familiar with Scout’s request emphatically told FITSNews.

Two months ago, Scout announced its intention to locate its new corporate headquarters in the Queen City – bringing an estimated 1,200 high-paying, corporate jobs and $200 million in capital investment to North Carolina. Scout chose Charlotte over Charleston, S.C., an abject humiliation for McMaster – who has breathlessly fellated Scout for years.

Last year, McMaster unsuccessfully championed legislation which would have given the woke EV automaker an undeserved leg-up on its competitors by ensconcing it as the only vehicle manufacturer permitted to bypass the Palmetto State’s established dealer marketplace. McMaster also unsuccessfully sought an additional $100 million in recurring annual funding for EV industry scholarships from the S.C. Education Lottery.

FITSNews has consistently opposed market-distorting crony capitalist subsidies – and specifically the Scout deal, which is looking more and more like previous failed boondoggles with each passing day.

***

“Scout got an insanely (and we mean insanely) good deal from South Carolina lawmakers, one no government in its right mind should have ever offered up based on prevailing market conditions,” I noted in a recent editorial.

Not only that, the deal was rushed through the legislature in just seven days – providing absolutely no opportunity for public scrutiny.

Which appears to have been the whole point…

South Carolina made its massive investment in Scout at a time when the EV market was already showing signs of collapse – which is probably why no other state seriously entertained the project (save Mississippi, which offered a comparatively small $150 million in total incentives to the company).

Needless to say, we encourage lawmakers to reject McMaster’s latest entreaties on behalf of this über-woke crony capitalist corporation…

What the change means

By removing the U.S. from the UNFCCC and related agencies — including scientific bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — the administration has effectively reduced Washington’s role in shaping global climate strategy, emissions reporting and cooperative climate finance mechanisms.

The shift builds on earlier actions by the Trump administration. In 2025, for example, Trump issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement — the landmark climate pact under the UNFCCC — for the second time since his first term, meaning the nation will again stand outside the global framework aimed at limiting global temperature rise.

Global leaders condemn the move

The withdrawal from the UNFCCC — the umbrella treaty that underpins nearly all multilateral climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement — has drawn sharp criticism from global officials and experts.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called it a “colossal own goal” that threatens both the U.S. economy and public welfare as climate-related risks grow.

European Union Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra described the U.S. retreat as “regrettable and unfortunate,” emphasizing that the UNFCCC “underpins global climate action” by bringing nations together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also expressed “regret” over the United States’ broader withdrawal from several U.N. and international entities tied to climate, labor and migration policy, while reminding member states of their ongoing funding obligations under the U.N. Charter.

Legal questions about the withdrawal

Some legal experts and critics argue the president may lack authority to unilaterally exit a treaty that was ratified by the Senate.

Harold Hongju Koh, former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department, said the move “may be illegal” because the Constitution requires Senate approval to enter treaties, suggesting — in his view — similar approval might be necessary to leave one.

Local voices and past reactions in Indianapolis

While national and international reactions have dominated headlines, local leaders in Indianapolis point to the potential domestic impacts of reducing federal climate engagement — particularly amid increasingly extreme weather and environmental health concerns.

In the past, when the U.S. exited the Paris agreement under Trump’s first term, then-Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said joining the pact was “about ensuring the future health and livability of our city” and pledged to pursue local climate action.

Balancing local priorities with global retreat

Some local business leaders argue that reducing federal climate commitments could free up resources for domestic economic growth, while others counter that embracing clean energy and sustainability offers long-term economic opportunities — especially in technology, construction and manufacturing sectors.

Indiana’s energy sector, historically reliant on coal and natural gas, sits in a transition toward more diversified energy sources. Under Braun, the state has taken steps to shape that transition, including the creation of a Strategic Energy Growth Task Force to address rising electricity demand and a push to expand nuclear energy, including support for small modular reactors. Indiana has also joined a multi-state initiative focused on advancing nuclear development and launched a federally funded energy efficiency program aimed at lowering utility costs for residents. How the federal withdrawal from international climate agreements will affect Indiana’s long-term energy planning, investment incentives and clean-energy partnerships remains unclear.

Economists and climate analysts in the region note that while U.S. withdrawal from international treaties does not directly dictate domestic energy policy, it sends a signal that could influence investor confidence, federal funding for climate research and interstate cooperation on emissions reduction.

Looking ahead

As the United States moves forward outside the UNFCCC framework, cities and states may increasingly take the lead on climate initiatives — a trend supporters of local action say could accelerate community-based solutions.

For Indianapolis, the latest federal posture underscores the tension between national policy and local climate realities — from heat waves and flooding concerns to long-term planning for sustainable growth.

As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.
“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice.
Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.
“REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.” The full petition is available here.","Hundreds of millions of dollars intended to cut energy costs have been funneled to costly manure digesters, benefitting industrial-scale livestock operations.

WASHINGTON — Today, a coalition of 34 organizations filed a rulemaking petition urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS) to deem anaerobic digesters that are located at industrial livestock operations or use livestock manure ineligible for grants and loans under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). At the same time, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit on behalf of petitioner Friends of the Earth, challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s violation of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for illegally withholding public records that detail the agency’s decisions to fund manure digesters using REAP dollars.

“REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” said Molly Armus, Animal Agriculture Policy Program Manager at Friends of the Earth. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

The petition urges RBCS to disqualify manure digesters from REAP funding because these projects undermine the very goals the program was created to advance. REAP was created to help farmers and rural small businesses cut energy costs and strengthen local economies; yet hundreds of millions of tax dollars have been funneled into expensive, polluting manure digesters. Manure digesters, which are meant to capture methane emissions and generate energy from large amounts of animal waste, overwhelmingly benefit industrial-scale livestock operations, fuel consolidation in rural areas, and contribute to air and water pollution that threatens nearby residents.

The petition also notes that over the last five years, new manure digesters received average loan guarantees of $18.7 million, almost three times more than the average loan guarantees for solar projects, all while delivering far less energy per taxpayer dollar than the solar projects. As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.

“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “Manure digesters do not offer cost-effective emissions reductions or energy generation, and supporting them keeps limited funds from going to practices that reduce emissions, support small farms, and mitigate air and water pollution.”

Petitioners include: Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment, Cape Fear River Watch, Center for Food Safety, CleanAIRE NC, Climate Action California, Environmental Justice Community Action Network, Farm Aid, Farm Forward, Food & Water Watch, Friends of Toppenish Creek, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Kansas Rural Center, Kissimmee Waterkeeper, Michiganders for a Just Farming System, Milwaukee Riverkeeper, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, National Family Farm Coalition, Nebraska Communities United, Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, Organic Farming Research Foundation, Potomac Riverkeeper, RE Sources, RedTailed Hawk Collective, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Shenandoah Riverkeeper, Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Sustain Rural Wisconsin Network, Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, and Waterkeeper Alliance.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed today challenges USDA’s unlawful use of the “deliberative process” exemption under FOIA to withhold 25 spreadsheets that show how the agency evaluated digester funding applications. These records reflect final decisions, not internal deliberations, and are critical for the public to understand why USDA uses its limited REAP funds to support these harmful and ineffective projects.

The petition outlines how funding for digesters is hurting–not helping–farmers and our environment, including:

Benefits go to the biggest polluters. Subsidies for anaerobic digesters primarily benefit the largest industrial animal operations, giving them another subsidized competitive advantage over smaller farms and accelerating the loss of independent farms and rural economic vitality.

Environmental harms. The petition documents numerous environmental harms associated with digesters, including spills and overflows releasing hundreds of thousands of gallons of waste into waterways as well as increased ammonia and nitrate pollution from the leftover byproduct, digestate. Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.

High costs and poor returns. Digesters often cost between $2–12 million, require enormous taxpayer subsidies, and rarely recoup their costs. They’re also inefficient, with the digesters that received loan guarantees generating 4.5 times less energy per dollar than solar loan guarantee recipients. Specifically, the digesters that received loan guarantees generate an average of 8,047 BTUs annually per REAP dollar, while the solar projects that received loan guarantees generate an average of 36,728 BTUs annually per REAP dollar. Data further shows that many digesters shut down prematurely, making them a risky investment of public dollars.

Better alternatives to build resiliency exist. REAP is consistently oversubscribed, so by making digesters ineligible, more funding could support projects like solar panels for small farms or energy-efficient refrigeration for rural grocery stores. These are the types of projects that lower costs and deliver lasting community benefits.

“There is no way to make factory farm gas sustainable,” said Sherri Dugger, Executive Director at Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “Rather than using already limited REAP funds to subsidize these toxic operations, USDA should support the independent farmers, small business owners, and rural residents who are working to build healthier outcomes in their home communities.”

“These enormously expensive digesters serve as a subsidy for factory farms, incentivizing them to get bigger to produce more waste as they push small and mid-sized farms out,” said Ben Lilliston, Director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “Digesters are an increasingly risky investment, when more stable and cost effective options for renewable energy are in high demand from farmers.”

“This petition is important to the people of south central Washington where farmers are struggling to survive after three straight years of drought,” said Jean Mendoza, Executive Director of Friends of Toppenish Creek. “The REAP program should endeavor to disperse funds as equitably as possible with a goal of maximizing environmental benefits for all farmers. REAP funding should not be siphoned off to benefit a segment that actively and brazenly pollutes the land.”

“The use of anaerobic digesters exacerbates the already heavy burden imposed by factory farming on communities and the environment,” said Patience Burke, Pure Farms, Pure Waters National Campaign Manager at Waterkeeper Alliance. “This petition removes the veil and is a powerful illustration of how factory farm biogas is not a clean source of energy. Limited REAP funding should be available to truly renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and not used in a way that perpetuates the abysmal manure management practices of factory farming.”

“It is important that the government takes steps to ensure that applicants selected for this funding are using the best available technology for the protection of the public’s health,” said Sherri White-Williamson, Executive Director of Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

“For too long, USDA has allowed factory farms and their Big Ag backers to syphon limited conservation funds toward expensive, ineffective, and dirty factory farm biogas projects,” said Tyler Lobdell, Senior Attorney at Food & Water Watch. “USDA must cut them off. It’s time these federal dollars were put back in the pockets of sustainable farmers who need them most.”

“REAP should help build the Michigan we all want to see by supporting truly clean energy, not subsidizing polluting manure digesters on factory farms.” said Val Schey with Michiganders for a Just Farming System. “Ending REAP funding for digesters would ensure the program works for Michigan’s rural communities, not against them.”

“In North Carolina, communities are living next to some of the nation’s largest hog operations, many of them owned by international corporations,” said Anne Harvey David, Chief Counsel for Environmental Justice at Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “That reality is a far cry from the small family farms REAP was meant to serve.”

“Factory farm gas is being sold as climate progress, but in reality, it locks in the very pollution and consolidation that rural communities are struggling to escape,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Executive Director of Farm Forward. “Taxpayer dollars spent on digesters prop up industrial animal operations while worsening air and water pollution. USDA should redirect these funds to farmers and ranchers who are producing food in ways that actually protect the climate, public health, and rural livelihoods.”

“Factory farm biogas production further enriches industrial animal agriculture and biogas developers at the expense of rural communities,” said Christine Ball-Blakely, Senior Staff Attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.”

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate.
“But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.” Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details.
“People respond to incentives.” Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.
While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.","“We need to see the details of the new program, but this is a policy that has worked in the past,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers and successfully lobbied congressional Republicans to kill California’s nation-leading EV sales mandate in June. “At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California — and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country.”

Yes, automakers overwhelmingly opposed California’s vehicle emissions rule, which had required them to sell an increasing proportion of EVs each year. But they also weren’t pleased with Trump’s dismantling of Biden-era incentives for car buyers and battery manufacturing. (See Bozzella’s reference to “current market conditions,” which also includes the administration’s ongoing tariff policy.)

That dynamic opens a window in forthcoming negotiations on the proposal, which finance officials left vague and said they plan to hash out by February, that could thaw Newsom’s relationship with car companies — and keep the state’s climate goals on track — as he terms out of the governor’s mansion and looks towards higher office.

While Newsom has reserved his most pointed criticism for General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he’s repeatedly said in recent months “sold out” California, he hasn’t been afraid to issue barbs to the industry as a whole.

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate. “But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.”

Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details. Among the unanswered questions are who would qualify for the incentive and if there will be a cap on the price of EV models that are rebate-eligible. Companies like Rivian and Hyundai already weighed in during a series of California Air Resources Board workshops last year, advocating for a simple-to-use rebate without an income requirement.

“In our view, every $1,000 leads to a bump in EV registrations in the state,” Tom Van Heeke, Rivian’s senior policy adviser, said in November. “People respond to incentives.”

Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the state should work closely with the automakers to design an incentive program that gets more EVs on the road — and bury the hatchet in the process.

“I think this is a real opportunity for partnership,” she said.

Not all enviros are thrilled with the idea of handing the keys over to automakers.

Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air, said he’s encouraged by the inclusion of EV funding in the budget, but that incentives need to target low-income drivers who are more likely to need help covering the cost. And he recoiled at the idea of car manufacturers taking the leading role in designing the program.

“Now that they have bitten the hands that fed them, are they really expecting a handout?” Magavern said. “The program design should be based on what’s good for Californians, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and not be based on what’s good for large auto companies.”

One thing that Newsom’s budget omits: Incentives for zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, which the state has also lost the authority to mandate and which have a disproportionate impact on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.

Trucking fleets and manufacturers argued during a November workshop that those incentives — which are typically snatched up the same day California opens applications — are the most important tool for transitioning to cleaner models.

“We need to make sure these trucks are at the same price as the diesel equivalent when they open their paychecks and they justify the purchase of that truck,” said Chris Brown, head of government affairs at Harbinger Motors, which builds electric delivery trucks in Orange County.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F74%2Fea%2Fa44be1b14da5a56522b9faf645f2%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1239417080,N,,2026-01-14 09:58:46.780802

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease – meaning their bills will be $44 lower when compared to January

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – Today, Duke Energy Florida announced that the storm cost recovery charge – the result of costs associated with the company’s approximately $1.1 billion response to hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton – will be removed from customers’ bills a month earlier than originally scheduled.

What this means

Because the full amount for all three storms was recovered ahead of schedule, beginning in February (instead of March):

Residential customers can expect an approximately $33 reduction on their monthly bills, when compared to January, for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity they use.

Commercial and industrial customers’ monthly bills will be lowered between 9.6% and 15.8%, also when compared to January, though the specific impact will vary depending on several factors.

Our view

“We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.”

More savings coming soon

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease (per 1,000 kWh) on their monthly bills, reflecting a seasonal decrease that Duke Energy Florida institutes annually (March-November) to help customers save money during times when energy use is typically higher.

This means, when compared to January, their March bills will be approximately $44 lower – again, per 1,000 kWh.

Even more savings

Recently, the company also:

Made efficiency improvements at many of its natural gas plants (see here), saving customers $340 million in fuel costs

This translates to $10 savings on customers’ monthly bills

Completed three new solar energy sites (see here and here), saving customers another $750 million from displaced fuel costs

Passed on $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to customers

This saves residential customers at least $2.50 per 1,000 kWh

Help is available

While Duke Energy Florida is focused on keeping its own costs in check, the company is committed to connecting customers with practical ways to save energy and manage their bills, including flexible payment plans. For more information, please visit duke-energy.com/SeasonalSavings.

The details: At a kickoff press event for the Detroit Auto Show, Barra said the elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit and rollback of fuel emissions standards have required GM to shift its product strategy but stressed that EVs are still key to the company’s long-term plan, reports Reuters.

GM will continue to develop plug-in hybrids and evaluate traditional hybrids while focusing on EVs because they are better products, said the CEO.

She also expects easier charging capabilities and lower pricing for electric vehicles will help grow adoption, even with policy rollbacks.

“It will take longer without the incentives, but I still think we’ll get there over time,” said Barra.

Why it matters: For GM dealers, Barra’s message is clear: Instead of going away completely, EVs are now on a slower, more complicated path. That means stores need to be ready to sell and service a mixed portfolio of ICE, hybrids, and EVs for years, while staying aligned with GM’s evolving incentives, product cadence, and charging solutions as policy winds shift.

Even amid the challenges, electric vehicles will continue to be a priority for GM, as the U.S. volume leader focuses on maintaining flexibility to be able to adjust to regulations imposed by other administrations down the road, explained Barra.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what will be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” added the CEO.

In Great Britain’s most competitive auction for renewable subsidies to date, energy companies vied for contracts that guarantee the price for each unit of clean electricity they generate.

Contracts were awarded to eight new offshore farms after ministers doubled the amount of funding available to developers to help them produce projects worth £22bn.

The government expects the investment to support 7,000 skilled jobs, and has promised that its clean energy agenda would help to lower energy bills for good.

The funding was awarded to offshore windfarms with a total capacity of 8.4 gigawatts (GW), or enough to generate clean electricity for more than 12m British homes by the end of the decade.

These included standard windfarms fixed to the seafloor and a new generation of floating windfarms that could help the UK to build projects in far deeper areas of the North Sea.

The standard windfarms were awarded a contract price of £89.49 a megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2024 prices for those in Scotland, and £91.20/MWh for those in England and Wales. The two floating windfarms were granted a contract that will earn £216.49/MWh.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “We’ve secured a record-breaking 8.4GW of offshore wind … This is the largest amount of offshore wind procured in any auction ever in Britain or indeed Europe.”

He called it “a significant step towards clean power by 2030”, adding: “The price secured in this auction is 40% lower than the alternative cost of building and operating a new gas plant. Clean, homegrown power is the right choice to bring down bills for good, and this auction will create thousands of jobs throughout Britain.”

The most successful energy company in the bidding was the German utility RWE, which secured contracts for almost 7GW of offshore wind projects out of the 8.4GW total, including its Dogger Bank South and Norfolk Vanguard windfarms. Shares in the €36bn company climbed by almost 1.5% on Wednesday morning.

SSE also won a contract for the first phase of its massive 4.1GW Berwick Bank project off the Scottish coast. The market value of the London-listed company surged in early trading before settling at 0.5% higher by midday.

Although the winning bids’ prices are higher than in previous years and above the typical price of electricity in the wholesale power market, which stands at about £81/MWh, experts say the growth of wind power in the UK energy system could still help to keep bills down because they would lower the market price by limiting the use of expensive gas plants.

The government said investing in locally generated renewable electricity would also help to reduce the UK’s exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets, which have contributed to record high energy debts and cost inflation across the UK economy.

The success of the auction was considered crucial if the government hoped to achieve its election pledge to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030 with the aim of creating a virtually zero-carbon electricity system by the end of the decade.

However, the government will need to repeat the results of its record-breaking auction by securing another 8GW of offshore wind power at similar prices at next year’s allocation round if it hopes to meet its goal of committing to between 43GW to 50GW of offshore wind by 2030.

Andy Prendergast, the national secretary of the GMB trade union, said “the real litmus test” of the auction’s success would be “if it delivers the jobs so often promised and so often fail to materialise”.

“This is a golden opportunity to on-shore supply chains and create genuine employment opportunities across the UK. It’s imperative that we take it,” Prendergast said.

The UK government has faced criticism for accelerating its investment in offshore wind at a time when the technology faces higher costs. Supporters of the industry have argued that speedy investment is key to replacing Britain’s ageing nuclear and gas plants, about half of which are due to close before 2035.

“Investment in renewables is also crucial to keep pace with the UK’s need for more energy,” said Ana Musat, a policy director at RenewableUK. “Electricity demand is set to increase significantly in the years ahead as existing nuclear and gas capacity retires, so the 8.4GW awarded contracts today will be crucial for economic growth.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7bfcaf2e88dfadc29df99a99adb89dd45eef7b7/87_0_4606_3685/master/4606.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93ad2a5b0d0f71cb2ae7d6b6a4a278d8",N,,2026-01-14 11:00:44.255985

A major reason for this is an extensive backlog of clean energy projects.
A report jointly published by Clean and Prosperous and the nonpartisan research firm Greenline Insights finds that more than 250 clean energy projects have stalled due to permitting and other delays.
According to the report, Washington has the right ingredients for success: a pipeline of projects, strong policies and goals, industry, and abundant resources.
“The part that now we're struggling with really exists outside the Climate Commitment Act, and outside our state's 100% clean energy law.","“I hope that after this panel, you're all comfortable saying ‘build sh**,’ knowing what we mean behind it. It’s a genuine intent,” joked Isaac Kastama, the government relations director for the nonprofit Clean and Prosperous Washington.

Kastama was wrapping up a panel discussion about a new report with a cheeky acronym: the Build Sustainable High Impact Infrastructure Together, or ""‘Build SHIIT’"" Report, at the eighth annual Carbon Policy Forum in Seattle. He was joined by the state directors of commerce and ecology, and the chair of the state council to evaluate energy facility sites.

The humor is meant to call attention to a serious issue. Despite leading the nation in climate policy, Washington has fallen far behind in renewable energy growth.

Recent reporting from ProPublica and OPB showed Washington ranking dead last among U.S. states in renewable energy growth. A major reason for this is an extensive backlog of clean energy projects.

A report jointly published by Clean and Prosperous and the nonpartisan research firm Greenline Insights finds that more than 250 clean energy projects have stalled due to permitting and other delays. It says those projects add up to $149 billion in economic activity and 580,000 jobs.

Their findings include a map showing project specifics. Tiny colored dots represent everything from large-scale solar developments to a green hydrogen biomass refinery, wind farms and pumped storage proposals scattered all over the state.

According to the report, Washington has the right ingredients for success: a pipeline of projects, strong policies and goals, industry, and abundant resources. But the state continues to miss emissions reduction goals and to fall behind others.

Speaking to KNKX after the panel discussion, Kastama said this backlog is not all negative. Rather, it's a strong indication that Washington’s climate policies are “working really well to motivate the interest” of the sector.

“The part that now we're struggling with really exists outside the Climate Commitment Act, and outside our state's 100% clean energy law. That is, how do we manage other processes to get these facilities permitted?” he said.

Kastama said they need a stronger consensus that these projects are necessary and beneficial, especially with tribes and other local governments in rural areas.

More transmission lines are needed as well. One bill Kastama is working on this session seeks to create a new state entity to examine bottlenecks and facilitate new construction of transmission lines.

Officials on the panel agreed that meeting the mandates of state climate policies is challenging.

“When you look at a lot of work that's being done now, this is the first time it's ever been done,” Commerce Director Joe Nguyen said.

Nguyen said these challenges are often extremely complex, but that leaders need to step up.

“That is what leadership looks like, and that is why Washington state is able to build sh**, is because we are not scared of doing hard things,” he said.

Nguyen estimated that in the last four months alone, the state had lost out on ""probably 15,000 jobs,"" potentially because companies that wanted to come to Washington could not get enough energy to bring their project.

“They wanted to be here. Their clients were here. The workforce was here. Everything's great here, but they couldn't get the 10, 20, 50 megawatts that they wanted to be able to build,” he said.

Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said Gov. Bob Ferguson has given clear direction on these issues.

“We are incredibly motivated to prove that we can get things built in this state. And I think the report highlights that there's huge opportunity,” he said, adding that the state has a long history of maintaining strong environmental protections while growing the economy.

Sixkiller said the state needs to use more of a customer-service approach to permitting. And officials need to demystify what that permitting looks like.

“We need to do more to encourage people to come into a room and work together to deliver a project,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/191030b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+91/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F68%2F37fae915404f8cf10814722000ac%2Fap23140144489106.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:00:50.889445

“Sierra Club and our partners intervened in this case to defend Oregon’s clean energy law and to ensure that customers are not stuck paying more for a dirtier, less reliable energy system,” said Rose Monahan, Senior Attorney, Sierra Club.
The court reaffirmed that the PUC regulates monopoly utilities and has broad authority to hold them accountable,” said Claire Valentine-Fossum, General Counsel, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board.
This is a win for clean energy, regulation’s necessary role, and all Oregonians,” said Mike Goetz, Regulatory Affairs Director, Renewable Northwest.
PacifiCorp serves more than 600,000 Oregon customers and remains the state’s largest emitter of power-sector greenhouse gases.","MARION COUNTY, Ore. — Today, the Circuit Court for Marion County dismissed PacifiCorp’s appeal of the Oregon Public Utility Commission’s (PUC) determination that the utility failed to demonstrate “continual progress” toward meeting the emissions-reduction mandates of Oregon's clean energy bill, HB 2021. The law requires electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 100% by 2040.

PacifiCorp had argued in court that it could not be held accountable for failing to meet the standard because, in its view, the Commission had not clearly defined what “continual progress” required. The Court rejected that claim and sided with the PUC and environmental, clean energy, and consumer advocates—including Sierra Club, Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, and Renewable Northwest—affirming that under any reasonable interpretation of the statute, PacifiCorp’s plan plainly failed to comply.

Advocates stressed throughout the case that PacifiCorp’s 2023 Clean Energy Plan could not show continual progress because the company:

Never forecasted meeting any of HB 2021’s emission reduction targets,

Presented a plan that included significant backsliding compared to its prior clean-energy plans, and

Offered no coherent path for returning to compliance

Advocates emphasized that the lawsuit was a transparent effort to delay implementation of HB 2021 and avoid any consequences of failing to comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law. With the appeal now dismissed, the PUC’s decision stands, and PacifiCorp must take immediate steps to align its resource planning with state law—most critically by procuring affordable clean energy resources before federal tax incentives expire this year.

“Sierra Club and our partners intervened in this case to defend Oregon’s clean energy law and to ensure that customers are not stuck paying more for a dirtier, less reliable energy system,” said Rose Monahan, Senior Attorney, Sierra Club. “The court’s decision confirms what the record made clear: PacifiCorp has been moving backward, not forward, on reducing emissions and planning for the clean energy transition required by Oregon law.”

“This is an important victory for customers. The court reaffirmed that the PUC regulates monopoly utilities and has broad authority to hold them accountable,” said Claire Valentine-Fossum, General Counsel, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board.

“This ruling underscores that Oregon’s energy laws are not optional and that utilities must plan responsibly for a cleaner, more resilient grid—and when they fail to do so, regulators will step in to protect customers and the public interest,” said Alex Houston, Staff Attorney, Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.

“The Court’s decision upheld the PUC’s broad authority to implement and ensure the sanctity of Oregon’s clean energy mandates and made clear that Oregon utilities must bring forth actionable plans to comply with the law, or be held accountable. This is a win for clean energy, regulation’s necessary role, and all Oregonians,” said Mike Goetz, Regulatory Affairs Director, Renewable Northwest.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.
Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.
Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.
Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.","Ambitious electric service affordability legislation faced dozens of recommendations for improvement Tuesday — from lawmakers and lobbyists alike — across a two-hour hearing.

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

State explores multiyear rate setting, performance incentives for utilities

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1135812-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:03:11.599335

Of the approximately 60,000 Venezuelans living in the city’s metropolitan area, “at least a third have some connection to the oil industry,” Monaldi says.
“By 2016, before the sanctions, PDVSA was producing far less oil, something like 600,000 or 700,000 barrels.
It was a brutal collapse.” When the oil sanctions arrived in 2019, PDVSA was still producing 1.3 million barrels.
Last week, the Republican stated that the world’s largest oil companies had committed to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry.","At 53, Arturo lost the job where he had spent half his life. It was January 2003, and Hugo Chávez had begun mass layoffs at PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company. More than 18,000 people were left jobless overnight. Arturo, who was the executive manager of the company’s exploration unit and head of the technical team, learned about it from the press. “They fired us and took away all our benefits,” he recalls from his home in Houston, where he lives at 76. Two decades later, the same city that took him in after his dismissal is receiving the oil tankers that the United States is seizing from Venezuela. The same city that is ready to receive even more crude once — as Trump has promised — it begins to flow again in Venezuela as it did in the boom years.

The first of the ships, the Skipper, was intercepted last December while transporting 1.8 million barrels of heavy crude. It was taken to the coast of Galveston, about 50 miles from Houston, where it remains in custody. At over 300 meters in length, it cannot enter the port, so it is anchored offshore.

Since then, other vessels have been targeted by the Trump administration in its efforts to block tankers carrying sanctioned Venezuelan crude. The Centuries was intercepted on December 20 in the Caribbean. The Bella was pursued for weeks in the North Atlantic and finally captured in January, after futilely claiming Russian protection, as part of the ghost fleet evading international economic sanctions on the high seas.

Arturo, who asked that his last name be withheld, is one of nearly 20,000 Venezuelans working in Houston’s energy sector, according to Dr. Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute. Of the approximately 60,000 Venezuelans living in the city’s metropolitan area, “at least a third have some connection to the oil industry,” Monaldi says. He adds that hundreds of Venezuelans work at companies like Chevron, Shell, and Exxon, “many of them in high-level positions.”

The same professionals who helped build one of the world’s most successful oil industries now work in Houston, watching as confiscated ships arrive at the same place they fled to.

This is the case of Arturo, a geological engineer who worked for PDVSA for 32 years. He recounts that his workdays were “12 to 14 hours a day, including Saturdays and Sundays.” After being laid off, he founded his own company with other professionals in the sector. It operated in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. But traveling from Venezuela became increasingly difficult. “They wouldn’t allow us to work with any company in Venezuela,” he says. That’s why, in 2008, he decided to open an office in Texas, where he emigrated with his family.

The collapse of the industry

“What destroyed the Venezuelan oil industry was the lack of strong institutional frameworks, corruption, inappropriate expropriations, and the dismissal of thousands of workers,” says Dr. Luis A. Pacheco, former executive director of corporate planning at PDVSA. “The Venezuelan hydrocarbon industry has been the victim of bad policies for two decades,” he adds.

Pacheco, 75, was also CEO of BITOR, the Orinoco Belt’s extra-heavy crude subsidiary. He is now a research fellow at the Baker Institute. Both Pacheco and Monaldi agree that U.S. sanctions were not the primary cause of the collapse. “PDVSA was producing three million barrels when Chávez came to power,” Monaldi points out. “By 2016, before the sanctions, PDVSA was producing far less oil, something like 600,000 or 700,000 barrels. It was a brutal collapse.”

When the oil sanctions arrived in 2019, PDVSA was still producing 1.3 million barrels. Today it produces around one million. “Only 300,000 barrels less than when the oil sanctions began,” explains Monaldi.

“If you look at how much Iran or Russia produce, which have also been under sanctions for a long time, you’ll see they have a powerful oil industry. That’s your best answer,” Pacheco states. According to him, to revive the Venezuelan industry, an investment of “$100 billion over 10 years would be needed to reach 3.5 million barrels per day, plus recovering part of the refining infrastructure, the petrochemical industry, carrying out environmental remediation, and restoring the necessary electricity generation capacity.”

That very figure was recently mentioned by President Trump. Last week, the Republican stated that the world’s largest oil companies had committed to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry. “They are going to go in. They are going to rebuild the whole oil infrastructure. They are going to spend at least $100 billion,” he said.

“It’s unrealistic in the short term to think that this money will arrive without very substantial changes to the institutional framework, without political stability, and without a political consensus on opening up the sector,” warns Monaldi. Pacheco, for his part, believes that “under the current regime, it’s not possible to achieve the necessary changes. If you ask me tomorrow if there will be a political change, it might begin, but I don’t see it happening today.”

What could happen in the short term, according to Monaldi, is what he calls “low-hanging fruit.” Chevron, which already has signed projects and its own cash flow, could increase production. Repsol “might too.” And several small Texas producers, the so-called “wildcatters,” could also invest in conventional oil fields “from which PDVSA is barely extracting any barrels.” “The sum of Chevron, Repsol, and these small projects could add a maximum of 400,000 or 500,000 barrels over the next two years,” Monaldi estimates.

Meanwhile, the major Houston oil companies are proceeding cautiously. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, both expropriated by Chávez, are demanding guarantees before returning. “We’ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said last Friday.

Chevron, for its part, is the only U.S. oil company that never left the South American nation. Following the arrest of president Nicolás Maduro, the company issued a statement supporting “a peaceful, lawful transition that promotes stability and economic recovery.”

Clear rules, security and transparency

Miguel Morales, a 59-year-old Cuban who has worked in Texas refineries for eight years, says that “the majority of oil workers are Latino. They’re mostly Mexican because of the proximity, but there are also many Cubans and Venezuelans.” Regarding the arrival of the confiscated ships, he says that “it was quite shocking, given the United States’ capacity to carry out operations of that kind and to stop fuel shipments to Cuba and other countries.”

The operations have been methodical. The Skipper was sailing toward Cuba under a false Guyanese flag when the Coast Guard intercepted it off the Venezuelan coast on December 10. Days later, they did the same with the Centuries in the Caribbean, while it was sailing under a Panamanian flag. The Bella 1, which was renamed Marinera under a Russian flag, managed to escape, but was pursued for weeks until its capture. Another vessel, the Sophia, was seized in Caribbean waters last week.

Currently, only Chevron’s ships, which have a special license from Washington, continue to operate normally.

For Venezuelans like Arturo, the situation is emotionally complex. “Seeing those ships arriving here doesn’t evoke any feelings in me,” he says. “I see it as a transition process. There hasn’t been any real change yet. Now, with Maduro’s arrest, we’ll have to see if there’s a real change in how the country is run, from a political and democratic standpoint, in the oil industry, and in other areas.”

Arturo is a member of the Venezuelan American Petroleum Association, an organization with nearly 200 members. “Its goal is to preserve knowledge, maintain professional development, and support Venezuela in rebuilding its industry,” he explains. “Those of us Venezuelans who have been abroad for many years have been preparing to return to the industry if there is a change,” Arturo adds. When asked if he would return to contribute his experience to this effort, he says he is “willing to collaborate, but I don’t see myself returning to Venezuela to work in operations.”

“There are many Venezuelan professionals who are willing and of the right age to go,” Pacheco points out. “But it depends on their age, how well-established their families are, and how attractive the financial opportunity is.”

In that sense, Monaldi believes that with the right conditions, “a good percentage would return temporarily if the opportunity is attractive.” But without conditions, “they wouldn’t even want to leave as expatriates.”

For Miguel, the situation in Venezuela is a mirror of what could happen in Cuba. “With everything that’s happening now and with the expectation of possible change, I’ve considered the idea of moving back to my country,” he says. However, he wouldn’t leave Texas permanently. “I’ll maintain both nationalities as long as possible.”

“The United States has historically bought Venezuelan oil at market price, and I don’t see why it would be any different now,” Arturo says. “It’s a business, after all. It’s not like the oil is just hanging from trees for people to come and take. Foreign companies have to invest money.” For that investment to happen, everyone agrees that “clear rules of the game, legal certainty, and transparency in the processes” are needed.

“I envision a country where there is investment from North American companies and possibly also from Asian companies,” says Arturo. “Oil is a good business as long as it is managed with clear and transparent rules.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/2KZMJNXAJ5ON3PP5GURYLGCMFI.jpg?auth=351001271903272247dc0fee2f25dbf58e9344e1762815bbe82abb9da4d88d9a&width=1200,N,,2026-01-14 11:02:38.029306

In a decision that “has not been taken lightly but is necessary during the current situation”, Novo’s plans have been put on pause while Volvo Cars continues its search for an external battery technology partner.

As part of its ambition to produce batteries for its electric cars in Gothenburg, Sweden, Volvo founded Novo Energy as a joint venture with European battery company Northvolt to develop sustainable battery solutions.

When Northvolt filed for bankruptcy, Volvo took on full ownership of Novo. Novo was due to begin production of battery cells at the Gothenburg facility this year, which was planned to produce up to 50GWh annually.

According to an announcement from the battery company, until a new technology partner is secured, Novo can no longer proceed with its operations as previously planned. While Volvo continues the search, all positions in Novo (a total of 75 staff) have been laid off.

The company said that it is currently not possible to share details of when battery production could start, or under what ownership structure that might happen.

When Novo was founded, it was intended to produce cells for Volvo vehicles and potentially others in the Chinese-owned Geely group (of which Volvo is a part) at the Gothenburg facility, which was pegged to created 3,000 jobs.

Despite its findings taking an overall optimistic outlook, a report by transport research and data firm NewAutomotive noted Northvolt’s insolvency as evidence of “the financial and execution risks inherent in this capital-intensive sector”.

Europe remains heavily reliant on imports in the midstream refining and precursor/anode material production, while securing reliable sources of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite is of the utmost importance.

While China has long had a competitive advantage in battery manufacturing for EVs and energy storage applications due to strong national supply chains, global trade tensions have seen it restrict export of some of the components critical to battery production.

Those tensions have also impacted the stationary battery energy storage market, however the technology has benefitted from huge private and government investment in Western regions as its value has been proven both economically and logistically in achieving net zero.

The quick ROI that energy storage deployment offers has seen many formerly EV-focused initiatives switch to storage.

It could be that Volvo’s difficulty recruiting a technology partner is the result of an increasingly common reluctance to invest in the EV sector, reacting to legislative backtracking on the transition away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. All European-founded battery companies have struggled in the past few years in light of softened EV demand, competition from China and the US, and a lack of expertise in battery cell manufacturing.

Perhaps not unrelated, it may well be that many battery tech firms are otherwise occupied, or looking to be, by cell manufacturing supply deals with the storage sector, which at the moment can offer more certain long-term investment.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blte06b480a5882d293/69677d8e10eee8d949e987ec/Volvo_Novo_Energy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-14 07:58:20.075163

A hefty tax break for businesses included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” won’t be applied to state taxes under legislation advancing in the state Senate.

Republican fiscal leaders, however, haven’t said which of the dozens of other new federal tax cuts — including the temporary deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages — will be extended to state taxes.

An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.

The Senate Tax and Fiscal Committee last week endorsed Senate Bill 212 adopting a few of the federal tax breaks.

Committee Chair Sen. Travis Holdman, however, specified that the bill would not include a federal tax cut on some production property because of its cost.

“It’s just got a hefty price tag. It was $60-some million the first year, and it grew to like $300 million over four or five years,” Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “So it’s just just too hefty for us to do that.”

Sam Charron, a vice president of the Indiana Manufacturers Association, argued for adoption of that tax break, saying it “incentivizes manufacturers to increase their production capacity in the U.S. and, therefore, here in the state of Indiana.”

Uncertainty on other tax breaks

Holdman said his committee would take up a separate bill next week addressing whether to conform state tax law with 37 other provisions in the federal legislation.

He said the first bill focused on federal tax changes that would take effect for the 2025 tax year, with the aim of getting that bill to Braun’s desk by the end of January. It is set for a full Senate vote on Thursday.

Holdman hasn’t specified what will be adopted from the longer list, which includes the temporary federal deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S.

The state analysis projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages.

The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million.

The state tax code generally conforms with federal law for the simplicity of determining taxable income.

Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan.

Whatever tax measures the state Senate endorses will then go to the Indiana House for its consideration.

House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jeff Thompson, the chamber’s leader on tax matters, said he was in “ongoing discussions” on provisions such as the exemptions for overtime and tips income.

Securing vital battery minerals The scale of this commitment reflects growing confidence in domestic lithium production.
A planned Phase 2 expansion aims to bring total capacity to 20,000 tpa of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE).","The global push toward electrification continues to reshape international supply chains and manufacturing priorities. For executive leaders across the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and mining sectors, the evolution of procurement strategies is a primary concern.

The industry seeks to secure the critical minerals required for battery production. A new partnership between Lilac Solutions and Traxys North America highlights this transition. The two firms have formalised a binding 10-year offtake agreement for lithium carbonate.

Produced at the Great Salt Lake facility in Utah, this move signals a significant change in how critical minerals flow through North American supply networks. Under the terms of the agreement, Traxys will buy 50,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate over a decade.

This volume represents 100% of the planned Phase 1 production capacity. The agreement uses a ""take-or-pay"" structure, which provided Lilac the financial certainty required for a Final Investment Decision (FID). For the wider EV market, it secures a reliable supply of battery-grade material.

Securing vital battery minerals

The scale of this commitment reflects growing confidence in domestic lithium production. By locking in the entire Phase 1 output, Traxys underwrites the commercial viability of the project while securing its position in a competitive market.

This is particularly relevant for EV manufacturers, which require stable mineral flows to maintain production schedules. Lilac Solutions specialises in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology, which offers an alternative to conventional methods.

Its proprietary Gen 5 ion exchange technology could improve supply chain speed. Reports indicate the technology delivered an 87% recovery rate during pilot operations. Unlike evaporation ponds, which can take 24 months to yield results, this process works in hours.

For supply chain managers, the speed of DLE could mean shorter lead times and more responsive production cycles. Traditional lithium extraction requires extensive infrastructure and long processing times that create bottlenecks.

Enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity

The Great Salt Lake Phase 1 facility is designed to produce 5,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. This facility is expected to nearly double current US production, aiding companies seeking to diversify their supplier base.

A planned Phase 2 expansion aims to bring total capacity to 20,000 tpa of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE). This growth is essential for meeting the rising demand of the automotive sector as it transitions away from internal combustion engines.

Raef Sully, CEO of Lilac Solutions, explains: ""Securing offtake for 100% of planned output moves us closer to construction of a significant new source of domestic lithium."" This project provides essential support to battery manufacturing facilities.

For EV manufacturers, the primary challenge to mass adoption has been a fragile and geographically concentrated supply chain. Domestic projects like the Great Salt Lake facility help mitigate these risks by providing a localised source of high-quality materials.

Navigating global supply requirements

In US and European markets, tax credits are frequently tied to the provenance of minerals. Sourcing minerals domestically helps manufacturers meet these requirements while reducing transportation costs and the associated carbon footprint.

The 10-year structure offers a buffer against spot market volatility. This allows for better long-term financial planning and more predictable overheads for companies involved in the production of electric vehicle batteries.

Lilac has completed FEL-3 engineering and is collaborating with Utah regulators to finalise permits. The ion exchange media will be manufactured in Fernley, Nevada, creating a domestic supply chain that benefits the regional economy directly.

This integrated approach reduces dependency on international equipment suppliers. Successful implementation of these technologies could provide a blueprint for how the global EV market manages critical mineral shortages in the future.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/757e82107998a4e66f28b72e79b5a76d:1bbbb51d6ec79bf82485a648bb8b87f1/1737221472440.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 06:59:47.948855

CCI's advocacy against a liability shield for Big Oil follows last year's plea by nearly 200 nonprofit organizations to Democratic leaders in Congress asking them to oppose such legislation.","As Big Oil and its Republican defenders vow to fight a flurry of state and local lawsuits seeking to hold the industry accountable for its role causing catastrophic global heating and lying to the public about it, one climate defender on Monday urged congressional lawmakers to reject a so-called ""liability shield"" aimed at protecting fossil fuel companies from litigation.

With more than two dozen state and local climate lawsuits against Big Oil ongoing from Maine to Hawaii—and a successful outcome for youth litigants in Montana in 2023—Republicans from President Donald Trump down to state lawmakers are scrambling to find ways to stem the tide of legal action against one of their biggest sources of financial support.

In June, Republican attorneys general in 16 states asked the Trump administration for protections from climate lawsuits. The AGs suggested modeling such policy on a 2005 law protecting gun manufacturers from litigation when their products are used in crimes. As a result, no gun company accused of negligence has ever been brought to trial. Gun control advocates have been trying to repeal the law for years.

The CCI statement came in response to an announcement by the American Petroleum Institute—the nation's biggest oil lobby—that fighting state climate lawsuits is one of its top priorities for 2026. API has been named as a defendant in several state climate accountability and deception lawsuits.

As CCI explained earlier:

Communities across the country are paying nearly $1 trillion per year for damages from extreme heat, floods, wildfires, and rising seas and other extreme weather events that fossil fuel-driven climate change is making more intense, deadly, and destructive. Major oil and gas companies knew decades ago that their products would fuel these climate damages, but they orchestrated a Big Tobacco-style campaign of deception to mislead the public and protect their profits. More than 1 in 4 Americans now live in a state or community taking Big Oil companies to court to hold them accountable for this deception and make polluters pay for the harm they have caused.

""A legal shield for Big Oil could forever shut the courthouse doors for all Americans, forcing the rising bill for climate change onto taxpayers, and setting a harmful legal precedent that protects corporations instead of communities,"" CCI added. ""No industry should be above the law—especially one with a documented history of deceiving the public. Congress must oppose the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying efforts and keep the courthouse doors open for communities seeking accountability.""

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant.
At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning.
When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan.
Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana?","Let’s say you hired a landscaper to work on your backyard. But they left their trash and broken tools scattered around your property and made you clean it all up. Would you hire that same company to work on your front yard?

The Trump administration would, apparently.

The administration’s proposed five-year program calls for new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and, for the first time in decades, off the coast of California. But the same industry that will benefit from Trump’s plan already turned the Louisiana coast into a dumping ground, leaving infrastructure behind to decay and pollute our waters.

We can’t afford more of this. Much of Louisiana’s marine ecosystem has already been sacrificed for profit, and Trump’s plan would be devastating for the Gulf’s remaining manatees, sea turtles, gulf sturgeon and Rice’s whale — one of the world’s most endangered baleen whales, with an estimated population of just 51 animals.

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant. It should be a cautionary tale for other states.

There are currently more idle wells than producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning. Hundreds of these wells have sat idle for more than a decade, some far longer. These wells have proven to be dangerous, leaking oil into the water and spewing methane into the atmosphere. In April, Well 59 — an 82-year-old idle well — broke loose and spewed tens of thousands of gallons of pollutants into Louisiana state waters and wetlands.

For decades, operators have also avoided their cleanup obligations, selling off their low-producing wells to smaller companies, leaving their infrastructure to sit idle for some purported future use, or going bankrupt and deserting their platforms. Even though many of these companies raked in enormous profits while their wells were active, their attempts to evade cleanup obligations lead to persistent safety and environmental hazards.

This is California and Alaska’s future if Trump’s five-year plan moves forward. Louisiana can serve as their crystal ball, and the plan deepens the decommissioning crisis in the Gulf.

Long after operators pack up and leave, the underwater world off our coasts will be permanently scarred by rusting platforms and unplugged wells that leak harmful gases and toxins. The fishing industry that helps drive the Gulf Coast and Alaska’s economy could be in peril; so will California’s robust tourism industry and iconic beaches.

This danger is not lost on most coastal politicians, regardless of political party. When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan. Several top Florida politicians, all Republican, are still working to stop the expansion in the Gulf of Mexico, worried more drilling will harm the state’s tourism industry.

Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana? Once these wells are no longer profitable, the industry will follow its trusted playbook — pack up the equipment that still works and leave the rusting remnants behind for us to deal with.

These companies should be paying to clean up the disaster they created in Louisiana. Instead, they’re bidding on the next marine environment to pollute.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/main-pass-oil-spill-2023-1024x7461768409637.jpg?h=bc62b519&itok=IbIMseaO,N,,2026-01-14 12:01:40.641105

Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country’s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.
The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought.
In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people.
“Water is a basic human right,” said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources.","“How can we be living in the United States of America … one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?” asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation’s largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

A report published in March identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome’s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology — all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.

“What we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,” said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. “In spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.”

CLIMATE IMPACTS AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people’s access to water. In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system.

In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.

Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country’s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.

An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don’t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.

Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report “comes at a very depressing moment where we’re not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn’t seem, for the next four years.”

SOLUTIONS COME WITH CHALLENGES

The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.

The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.

The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida’s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.

The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BUT SOME ARE BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. “Our innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,” he said. “And that’s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.”

Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.

We have to take that into consideration.” In November, the Wyoming Outdoor Council released a white paper about data center policy in Wyoming that recommends regulations for permitting, site selection and community assistance.","Wyoming is poised to become an artificial-intelligence powerhouse after Laramie County commissioners last week unanimously voted to move forward with the construction of a 1.8 gigawatt data center designed to eventually scale up to 10 gigawatts, which would be the largest single AI campus in the U.S.

The facility will include the Project Jade data center campus built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe and the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub built next door by Tallgrass Energy Partners to provide it with electricity. BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub will provide on-site power from natural gas turbines. Matt Field, chief real estate officer for Crusoe, told the Laramie County commissioners during last week’s hearing that the first phase of the project will leverage natural gas with a potential pathway for CO2 sequestration in the future.

Crusoe and Tallgrass announced in July that the center’s close proximity to Tallgrass’ existing CO2 sequestration hub will “provide long-term carbon capture solutions” for the gas turbines powering the data center. “Future renewable energy developments” touted by the companies in their joint statement could include solar power to augment the gas turbines in later stages of the project, according to Wyoming Energy Authority.

The companies have yet to announce the specific tech firms to benefit from the Jade data center, but the project is expected to meet the extreme power and infrastructure demands of hyperscale cloud providers and AI industry leaders, said Crusoe spokesperson Andrew Schmitt.

Both of the interconnected projects are now proceeding to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne. With the site plans approved by the county, Crusoe and Tallgrass energy expect construction to be completed on the first buildings in 2027.

Prior to the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community adjacent to the project, wrote a letter to the county commissioners requesting that the site plan adhere to certain considerations. The letter details residents’ concerns with deep wells drilled into the aquifer, increased traffic and noise, light pollution, gas turbine emissions, noxious odors and the location of wastewater ponds. Additionally, the letter urged the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to ensure compliance with requirements to minimize the impacts to wildlife migration routes and sensitive habitat inside the project area.

The Associated Press reported that electricity needed to power the first phase of the center is predicted to double the entire state of Wyoming’s current energy generation. Compared to a report listing the 15 largest data centers in the world by the information technology provider Brightlio, the Jade Project could set a global record in energy use by a single center if the planned expansion reaches 10 gigawatts. Jones Lang LaSalle’s 2026 Global Data Center Outlook projects total global data center energy capacity to rise from 103 gigawatts to about 200 gigawatts by 2030.

“Building an American AI factory that can scale to 10 gigawatts of capacity illustrates Crusoe’s commitment to delivering infrastructure at the scale needed for the U.S. to win the global AI race,” Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller stated in a July press release announcing the project.

Jumping Into the AI Race

Wyoming developers and state officials have touted the projected benefits of becoming a hub for AI and high-performance computing, which they say will include job creation, economic diversification, increased tax revenue and demand for natural gas and renewable energy. The project’s construction phase is expected to employ approximately 5,000 workers at its peak, per the site plan. Field said the data center will have approximately 400 permanent jobs, ranging from janitorial positions to engineers.

“Wyoming is pro-business and pro-growth,” U.S. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said in a press release. “Our commitment to innovation and investment is what makes our state great. New, state-of-the-art data centers like this will bring high-paying jobs and a skilled workforce to southeast Wyoming.”

The state is also looking to nuclear energy to meet the increasing demands of the AI industry. TerraPower, the advanced nuclear reactor company founded by Bill Gates, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced Friday that Cheyenne is one of the sites being considered for a dual-unit Natrium power plant that could be completed as soon as 2032 to fuel the Meta AI data center already under construction there. TerraPower is building the world’s first Natrium reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming.

The proposals for AI are exciting for the state’s fossil fuel industry as well.

In a statement last year when the Jade data center was announced, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon wrote that the news was exciting for “Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers.” Gordon had previously called Wyoming an optimal location for AI expansion, partly due to its energy infrastructure and cooler climate.

Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told Inside Climate News that the state needs to keep up with the world’s growing demand for AI. Creager said that the AI platform ChatGPT will eventually become as mainstream as a Google search.

“I’ve heard it as an arms race before,” Creager said. “We can’t lose track of the fact that we’re in a competition with folk in China. It is really crucial to national security that we lead on AI and that we have those technologies.”

But Johanna Fornberg, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, has urged local and state governments to rein in huge AI investments. Legislators should instead focus on what directly benefits people’s lives, such as transitioning to renewable energy, Fornberg said.

“The industry has been using a lot of these big hypothetical promises about the benefits of AI,” Fornberg said. “They’re selling it for healthcare and curing cancer, accelerating climate action, improving well-being, even in your day-to-day life and in your job. And that’s all sort of a tactic to create demand and support for the data center buildout that’s happening.”

Fornberg noted that the Crusoe and Tallgrass project, which will use “an unprecedented amount of power in a relatively short amount of time,” is an example of charging ahead without fully investigating the potential risks involved.

“This data center, at 10 gigawatts, is huge,” Fornberg said. “I mean, a large nuclear power plant provides about 1 gigawatt of energy. So, at the top end, we’re talking about the same energy output as 10 big nuclear power plants, which is a lot.”

AI’s Opportunities and Challenges for Wyoming Energy

Wyoming’s energy resources position the state to capitalize on AI, Creager said.

“Everybody knows that there is plenty sitting in the ground that can help fuel this,” Creager said, noting that Crusoe’s plan to augment its electricity supply with solar should bring down the demand for gas. “I think it’s doable. I think as we do this … we’ll figure out how to do it more efficiently.”

Some AI data centers, including Microsoft’s facility in Cheyenne, power their servers with a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy, and learning how to power and manage data centers efficiently is a work in progress, Creager said.

Neither Crusoe nor Tallgrass made representatives available for comment, but Crusoe’s website stated that the center would source energy from natural gas rigs outfitted with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to limit their emissions of climate-warming gases.

But Fornberg believes using CCS for data center energy generation is counterproductive.

“Carbon capture is sort of one of these techno solutions that is very energy intensive, expensive and often just increases net emissions and pollution overall,” she said. “Especially when compared to just replacing those energy sources with clean energy sources. It’s a way that we are really providing a longer lifespan for existing fossil fuel infrastructure. And in some cases, even justifying new fossil fuels.”

An August analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from U.S. data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing carbon emissions through 2030 by approximately 220 million tons. Those increased emissions could also impact human health, Fornberg added.

“Part of the nature of working with gas as an energy source is that you have these leaks and in some cases, intentional flares or releases of gas,” Fornberg said. “That is a major climate impact but can also cause well-documented health impacts for the communities that live locally to those gas generation facilities.”

Crusoe and Tallgrass have yet to state the amount of solar power that will be paired with natural gas or at what stage in the project solar power would be included in the energy mix.

Thirsty Technology in a Water-Stressed State

A single data center’s cooling towers can consume millions of gallons of water annually to prevent the computing infrastructure from overheating, according to Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions, which is particularly problematic for a facility as large as Project Jade in an arid state like Wyoming.

To reduce that demand, Crusoe announced plans in its 2024 Impact Report to combat significant water loss at its data centers by implementing closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids.

Still, there are always system losses, said Jonathan Brant, a University of Wyoming environmental engineering professor.

“Even if it’s a quote-unquote closed loop, you’re going to have losses because of the nature of heat exchange,” Brant said. “Those computers generate an incredible amount of heat.”

To remove the most heat from computers, water must transform from a liquid into a vapor, Brant explained, and a portion of that evaporates, much like the billowing clouds that rise from the cooling towers at power plants. How much new freshwater will be needed to replace what evaporates from the cooling system is a critical question, he said.

“It’s scary when you think about the power and the water that’s going to be consumed by these facilities,” Brant said. “That’s why they keep it secret.”

Many AI centers in Wyoming tap into brackish or alkaline groundwater, as opposed to using freshwater, Brant said, but even if the cooling water is sourced from an aquifer with water too low quality for other uses, it could potentially impact a connected aquifer with a potable supply, so industry engineers must study how aquifers are connected before tapping into them. And safely disposing of increasingly salty water after it has undergone many cycles of heat exchange also poses a challenge, Brant said.

“Some say they’re going to reinject it, like they do in the oil and gas field,” Brant said. “That may work. But if that’s not something that can be done, are they just going to use surface impoundments? Evaporation ponds can be an environmental hazard just like they are in the gas sector.”

If waste water is expelled during the cooling process, it could be contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. PFAS are used to prevent the corrosion of AI electronics, which would pose other health concerns, Fornberg cautioned. Studies have linked long-term exposure to even low levels of some PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” for their persistence in the environment, with serious health problems, including cancer and damage to reproductive and immune systems.

A Lack of Regulation

During the hearing to review the Jade project’s site plan, several Laramie County residents voiced concerns with lack of water regulations.

The plan states that engineers plan to drill deep wells underneath the shale and sandstone Lance Formation to access industrial water beneath the Ogallala Aquifer’s potable water. But Randy Fox, president of Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, questioned whether the geologic survey of the region that will guide the drilling of the wells adequately maps the varying size and depth of the aquifer to protect the drinking-water supply.

“You don’t know until you punch a hole in it what you’re dealing with,” Fox said. “Does the state have the data to support drilling deep wells into the Lance Formation without compromising the Ogallala Formation’s [drinking water] above it?”

Resident Thomas White, who lives near the site of the Jade data center, is also concerned about water contamination.

“They say that they’re going to drill deeper,” White said. “What happens when they punch a hole and there’s leaks that contaminate the aquifer? How much water will they be taking out of the ground? We have to take that into consideration.”

In November, the Wyoming Outdoor Council released a white paper about data center policy in Wyoming that recommends regulations for permitting, site selection and community assistance.

Among them: mandating public energy and water use reporting “to allow regulators and communities to assess impacts of data centers and track progress toward efficiency or sustainability goals.” The report pointed to Illinois’ Data Center Energy and Water Reporting Act as a regulatory guide.

Wyoming has yet to establish laws to track the environmental and economic impacts of AI centers, and state legislators are not expected to discuss the growth of the industry during the upcoming budget session in February.

In December, Greenpeace USA, along with over 230 environmental groups, signed an open letter to Congress demanding a national moratorium on new data-center construction until regulations address environmental and economic concerns. State and local governments, which negotiate deals with data developers, need comprehensive rules, Fornberg said—protecting consumers from utility rate hikes, requiring renewable energy and more.

“There has to be strong regulations in place in order for these companies to do the right thing,” Fornberg said. “I think the issue is not whether or not we should value innovation, it’s how we are valuing innovation.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cruso-_Abilene-Data-Center-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 07:00:03.150161

The ONS economic data is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which does not always align with or capture the full detail of ‘frontier industries’ (subsectors, for example, artificial intelligence) within the IS-8. As a result, coverage varies across sectors.

The SIC system is hierarchical, ranging from broad sections to detailed 5-digit subclasses. To improve accuracy, we map IS-8 sectors using 4-digit SIC codes wherever possible, as higher-level SIC categories are too broad. This approach allows us to extract more precise economic metrics for each sector.

Table 1 summarises how well each IS-8 sector is represented by the SIC framework. View SIC definitions for the IS-8.

Table 1: SIC-based definition coverage across the IS-8

Clean Energy Industries cannot be proxied at all under the SIC system so is not captured in the business investment, GVA, employment, or productivity metrics. Defence and Life Sciences only have partial coverage.

Thus, overall IS-8 estimates for the economic indicators will not fully reflect all 8 sectors. Estimates are at the IS-8 sector rather than the frontier industry level for all frontier industries outlined in the Industrial Strategy.

The IS-8 sectors are not mutually exclusive, businesses can belong to more than one IS-8 sector. Therefore, we use a unique list of SIC codes rather than summing the totals for each sector.

Data sources and methodology

We use a combination of official datasets and estimation techniques, depending on how well each sector aligns with the SIC system.

1. Direct use of official data

For sectors such as Financial Services and Professional and Business Services, which can be directly mapped at the 2-digit SIC level, figures are taken directly from official data.

2. Apportionment for other sectors

For other sectors, it is necessary to produce estimates for lower-level SIC breakdowns than are published in timelier official data.

We apply apportionment fractions to the latest 2-digit SIC data to estimate data for low-level SIC industries. This approach combines 2 objectives:

timeliness – using the most up-to-date data available ensuring consistency with quarterly national accounts data

granularity – ensuring data reflects detailed sector structures

These fractions are derived from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) and Annual Business Survey (ABS), both of which provide granular SIC-level data. While the IDBR is timelier, it does not cover GVA or investment. For these measures, the ABS is used as it collects comprehensive sector-level financial information.

All apportioned values use the same price deflator as the 2-digit SIC level.

3. Data sources by metric

Table 2 summarises the main data sources for each economic metric.

Table 2: Data underpinning each economic metric

Metric Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors Business investment • ONS datasets on investment by industry (data is assembled from several published ONS spreadsheets on investment: Industry-level data taken from ONS Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by Industry and Asset (released 22 December 2025), Volume Index Capital Services (VICS) (released 7 November 2025) Supply and Use tables (released 31 October 2025), Business investment by industry and asset (released 22 December 2025)

• apportioned using the Annual Business Survey GVA • ONS GDP low-level aggregates (released 22 December 2025)

• apportioned using the Annual Business Survey Employment • payrolled employees from HMRC’s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) data (released 16 December 2025). Monthly figures are averaged to produce quarterly data

• apportioned using the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), breakdowns taken by Department for Business and Trade (DBT) from the IDBR dataset Productivity (output per job) • ONS GDP low-level aggregates (released 22 December 2025) divided by ONS productivity jobs figures (released 13 November 2025)

• apportioned using the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), breakdowns taken by DBT from the IDBR dataset

We use 2023 prices for GVA, business investment, and output per worker, consistent with the national accounts.

These metrics will be updated in future quarters to incorporate historic actuals and revised sector mixes when more accurate or recent data is published by ONS. Each new quarterly update supersedes all previous figures, so users should always refer to the latest release.

Approach for exports

Official ONS and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) trade data is not readily available at the IS-8 sector level, so a bespoke IS-8 trade definition has been created. This can be found in the accompanying exports definition list

Services exports are classified using the Extended Balance of Payments Classification (EBOPS) system, and goods exports using Harmonised System (HS) codes. Individual IS-8 sectors can export both goods and services – for example, Digital and Technology exports both use semi-conductors (goods) and cyber-security (service).

Estimates of trade in services and trade in goods are presented as separate values because they are not comparable on any basis so should not be added together. They use different data sources and different classification systems, and measure different concepts of trade.

The IS-8 sectors do not fully align with these classification systems (tables 3 and 4 for coverage). EBOPS uses broad categories making it difficult to isolate specific IS-8 components, while HS codes classify products, rather than industries or technologies, which limits coverage of emerging sectors.

For example, Clean Energy Industries exports are likely underestimated when using an HS-based approach compared to the ONS Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy survey (LCREE) as HS code inputs do not cover the entire sector. However, the latest ONS LCREE exports data is for 2023 so cannot be used to track Clean Energy exports in the quarterly update.

An HS-based approach for Defence differs from the UK Defence Export Statistics publication, which relies on an annual survey of defence orders won by known UK companies operating in the sector. The latest available data is for 2023, so it cannot be used to track Defence exports in the quarterly update.

An EBOPS-based approach for Creative Industries differs from the Department for Culture, Media, and Sports’ Trade in Services Economic Estimates publication, which is classified by the business involved in the trade and not the type of service provided. The latest available data is for 2023, so it cannot be used to track Creative Industries exports in the quarterly update.

The EBOPS and HS IS-8 mapping is subject to change as further analysis is undertaken.

Services and goods definitions for the IS-8 can be found in the accompanying exports definition list.

ONS Trade in Services is used to measure services exports. The data was extracted from UK Trade in Services: service type by partner country, non-seasonally adjusted Q2 2025 released by the ONS in October 2025 for the period of Q1 2024 to Q2 2025.

Services export data is collected via a survey and measures the value of transactions of UK businesses by industry. The data is calculated on the ‘change of ownership’ principle of trade, meaning trade is recorded when ownership of the service transfers between UK and non-UK entities.

HMRC Trade in Goods data is used to measure goods exports. The data was extracted from the Overseas Trade Data table from January 2024 to September 2025 for all exports; this was the November 2025 release. HMRC trade in goods data is based on a ‘cross-border’ or ‘physical movement’ principle where goods entering and leaving an economic territory are recorded as imports and exports respectively.

Approach for new large ‘home-grown’ businesses

For a business to be included as part of the metric, it must satisfy all of the following criteria:

the company must be founded in the UK – it originated in the UK and is not a subsidiary or branch of a foreign firm

it is headquartered in the UK, meaning it is incorporated in the UK and registered with Companies House

there is no foreign parent company – it is not majority owned or controlled by a foreign entity

the company has a significant economic footprint in the UK – this means a significant proportion of its workforce, operations, or supply chain is based in the UK

the company must have a valuation benchmark of over £10 billion

To ascertain a valuation benchmark of £10 billion, market capitalisation and post-money valuations will be used. These measures will capture both listed and private companies in the UK. Data is collected from Companies House and the Stock Market to calculate company valuations.

Based on the definition, as of 16 December 2025, there are currently 27 businesses in scope. This number represents a baseline of existing businesses, rather than exclusively new large firms. The number is subject to revision as further analysis is undertaken.

Major new investments made in IS-8 sectors

The quarterly update summarises the major investments in the IS-8 between October and December 2025 and their related job numbers. These are listed in the accompanying investment totals spreadsheet. We have recorded investment projects where government has been involved in the process or where they stem from policy decisions made as part of the Industrial Strategy.

The figures represent the nominal value over the lifetime of each investment and reflect the position at the point of announcement, rather than when the investment occurs or jobs are created. Therefore, they do not represent completed investment to date. The data is not subsequently updated or tracked in the table, so the actual amount invested may change after the original announcement.

Where announcements are updates from commitments made in previous quarters, we record only the net increase and exclude the previously committed value.

Major new export announcements in IS-8 sectors

The quarterly update summarises major export announcements relating to the IS-8 between October and December 2025 and their related jobs numbers, as listed in the accompanying export totals spreadsheet.

These figures reflect the nominal value of trade deals, export deals, contracts, sales, or other agreements that have resulted from support provided by UK government. This is separate from DBT’s reporting on export wins, which only refers to support provided by DBT only and is compiled via internal reporting rather than public announcements.

As with investment announcements, figures reflect the position at the point of announcement and are not subsequently updated or tracked. The amount of money that materialises in the economy may change after the original announcement.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales globally reached 20.7 million last year, up 20%, hitting record high, London based research firm Benchmark announced on Wednesday.

EV sales totaled 12.9 million units in China, up 17%, 4.3 million in Europe, up 33%, 1.8 million in North America, down 4%, and 1.7 million in the rest of the world, up 48%.

20.7 million units, globally, were sold in the passenger car and light-duty vehicle segment, Benchmark's press release read.

In Europe, the EV market grew by 33%, with 31% growth coming from Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 38% from Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) over the same period.

The press release recalled that the European electric vehicle market was marked by a year of legislative change, as EU tailpipe emissions targets were softened throughout the year.

Over 2025, EV sales accelerated in several major markets; large-volume countries such as Germany and the UK grew by 48% and 27%, respectively.

It said: ""2025 was a turbulent year for the North American EV market. In the US, the elimination of federal tax credits on 30 September 2025, alongside the reduction of

CAFE standards fines to zero and the introduction of protectionist policies aimed at onshoring vehicle production and supply chains, significantly weakened market

momentum.

""As a result, US EV sales grew by just 1% in 2025. Amid these changes, the Canadian market performed poorly following the removal of subsidies early in 2025, causing EV sales to fall by 41% over the year.""

In contrast, EV sales in Mexico grew by 29%, with the majority of this growth driven by imports of Chinese EVs.

In China, the EV market grew by 17% in 2025 compared with 2024, with BEVs increasing by 26% and PHEVs by 6% over the same period.

Year‑on‑year growth slowed markedly in the final quarter of 2025, reaching just 4% compared with the last quarter of 2024.

In contrast, EV sales in the first half of 2025 grew by 33% year on year.

In the rest of the world, a significant number of regions had a strong presence of Chinese EV imports, including Southeast Asia that almost doubled year-on-year and in the final three months of the 2025 average over 55,000 EVs sold per month compared with an average of 32,000 per month in the final three months of 2024.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/14/thumbs_b_c_8f552fbdd0e518c0ed86ee321400b0d1.jpg?v=115652,N,,2026-01-14 07:58:26.830746

This milestone certification follows a detailed review by a panel of independent experts confirming the physics and engineering basis of the Helios design, and its feasibility to put fusion energy on the grid

KEARNY, N.J., Jan. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thea Energy, Inc., a fusion technology company advancing the stellarator for the commercialization of a carbon-free and abundant source of energy, today announced the certification of its preconceptual “Helios” pilot plant design by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) following a detailed review by a panel of independent fusion experts. This preconceptual design review marks the completion of the final major milestone in the DOE’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program (“the Milestone Program”) and Thea Energy is the first awardee company to receive certification of its pilot plant design.

The Milestone Program launched with $46 million in funding across eight private fusion companies to support progress on the path to commercial power plants. Modeled after the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, essential in launching the private space industry, the Milestone Program supports companies focused on grid-scale power through non-dilutive capital and external validation, where funds are only paid when key milestones that de-risk fusion technologies are completed and approved by a review panel.

The U.S. DOE approved completion of the Helios preconceptual design following a detailed report review by independent experts from national laboratories, research institutions, and universities focused on fusion. Members of the DOE review team visited Thea Energy’s headquarters in Kearny, NJ as part of the certification. Reviewers focused on comprehensively validating that the Company has a system architecture and a robust path towards deploying a fusion power plant. Other disclosed milestones completed by Thea Energy since selection in 2023 include successful performance of the world’s first superconducting planar coil magnet array and the down selection to a family of stellarator plasma configurations.

“This final design milestone, now certified by the DOE, substantiates the validity of the planar coil stellarator and shows a clear pathway to a deployable power plant,” said Brian Berzin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Thea Energy. “Practicality, conservatism, and engineering margins are emphasized in Helios, and the DOE has recognized those differentiators in this design. The Helios preconceptual design reflects decades of specialized expertise, now vetted and confirmed by fusion leaders and foremost technical authorities. This significant approval allows us to definitively communicate confidence in this design to the interested power offtakers and hyperscalers that we are in conversations with. Working with the DOE across this milestone, and eight prior, ensured team Thea approached each cornerstone with rigor, scrutiny, and thoroughness. Now is the time to prioritize fusion and the teams driving meaningful progress, and we strongly support the expansion of the Milestone Program to align with the industry’s commercialization goals.”

“Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant” outlines how the Helios preconceptual design meets all requirements for a commercial fusion plant while detailing several world’s firsts for fusion: a system that combines software-controlled magnet coils that are adaptable to real-world conditions; a stellarator ‘divertor’ exhaust system capable of fusion power operations; and a stellarator sector-based maintenance scheme enabling long-term plant viability. This preprint is available on the Company’s website under “Presentations & Publications” and via arXiv. This paper was submitted to a peer-reviewed journal alongside additional manuscripts on specific system components further detailed in the Milestone Program report to the DOE.

Jean Paul Allain, Ph.D., associate director for fusion energy sciences in the DOE Office of Science, added, “The inaugural period of the Milestone Program’s goal is to see companies demonstrate critical underlying technologies while on the path to a preconceptual fusion pilot plant design. Thea Energy tackled key milestones swiftly and enthusiastically leading to this in-depth design for a modernized stellarator system – summarized in a 200-page report to the DOE. The Milestone Program mandates a heightened level of accountability from awardees and we look forward to seeing Thea Energy’s continued momentum.”

Felix Parra-Diaz, Ph.D., head of the theory department at the U.S. DOE’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and professor of astrophysical science at Princeton University, added, “As a member of the expert review committee, I had the chance to dive deep into Thea Energy’s Helios plant and verify that the Company had executed on this design with a remarkable degree of technical detail and high standards. Helios represents a new era for the stellarator where this magnet array and plant design pushes fusion towards a commercial format. I look forward to seeing the Company continue to work towards building a fusion power plant.”

Thea Energy is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s following “Eos”, its large-scale demonstration system which will create power-plant-relevant, steady-state fusion. Eos will directly benefit from the breakthroughs highlighted in the Company’s Helios design and is scheduled to be online by 2030. Thea Energy is currently in conversations with five states for the siting of Eos and expects to select and announce a location for the integrated system in 2026.

""Delays to nuclear power stations are bureaucratic and managerial,"" he writes, and ""it's not beyond our wit to make them cheaper by building them faster.""","Nuclear power construction projects in England and France, years late and billions over budget, reached milestones in recent weeks. In January, a project in Somerset, U.K. took delivery of its second reactor. In December the other project, in Normandy, France, powered up fully for the first time.

Instead of being examples of a bad trend, a prominent British supporter of atomic energy says, those projects are outliers and nuclear power developers and contractors are building new power plants faster than in the 1970s and 1980s.

""We're actually faster now,"" writes Tim Gregory, a nuclear chemist and author of ""Going Nuclear: How Atomic Energy Will Change the World"" (Pegasus Books, 2025).

The French state-controlled utility, Electricité de France (EdF), is developing both the English and French projects as European pressurized water-type power plants.

The completion of the U.K. project, Hinkley Point C, will likely stretch from an estimated seven years to 12 to complete, Gregory writes.

The first reactor arrived in 2023 and is already installed and welded in place, EdF reported. Work is proceeding faster on this later phase of work due to experience with the first reactor, the company wrote.

In Feb. 2024, following recent news of additional delays and cost hikes on the 3,260-MW power plant, EdF forecast completion to between 2029 and 2031, with costs rising to a range of $39 to 43 billion. The previous completion target set in May 2022 was June 2027.

At the Normandy project, EdF announced that it had reached full power in a test before operation of its EPR reactor, called Flamanville-3.

The ramp-up followed the approval by the French nuclear safety and radiation protection authority to go beyond the 80% power threshold, EdF stated. The plant was scheduled to be connected to the grid Dec. 30, EdF told NucNet.

Gregory notes in his book that the project will be finished at a cost many times what was first estimated in 2004.

Nuclear power's role as a carbon-free source of energy is likely to grow, he writes, but cost and schedule woes have plagued many recent projects.

Hinkley Point C and Flamanville-3 ""are outliers,"" argues Gregory, and ""we're actually faster now than we were in the 1970s and 1980s.""

Citing an International Atomic Energy Agency report from 2024, Gregory writes that Europe in those decades built nuclear power plants at a median time of 7 years and 2 months. France actually built numerous nuclear power plants slightly faster because it had picked a standardized pressurized water reactor design and built it over and over.

Slower Post-Chernobyl Build Times a Localized Issue

But since the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, Europe's median build time reached 13 years as the continent ""forgot how to build quickly,"" Gregory writes.

China, he says, has built 51 nuclear reactors since 1990, with a median build time of under six years. South Korea, too, has built 27 nuclear reactors since the 1970s. Although that country's three newest reactors took more than eight years to build, South Korea built 27 nuclear reactors since the 1970s in a ""decade-on-decade"" build time of under six years, says Gregory.

Cutting construction time will lead to savings, Gregory states. ""Delays to nuclear power stations are bureaucratic and managerial,"" he writes, and ""it's not beyond our wit to make them cheaper by building them faster.""

While nuclear reactors are built on time and budget in some parts of the world, says Gregory, ""We need the motivation to do it again in Europe and the USA.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2026/01/13/Hinkley-Point-C-nuclear-project.jpg?height=635&t=1768330060&width=1200,N,,2026-01-14 06:59:59.909442

Monthly registrations of electric vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrids, dropped further in North America after the end in October of an EV tax credit scheme in the United States, consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) said.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Radical policy shifts, including U.S. President Donald Trump's U-turn on electrification and a relaxation of emission standards in the European Union, shook the global EV market in 2025 into a ""virtually unrecognisable landscape"", according to BMI data manager Charles Lester.

Rising competition in Europe and cooling demand in China are likely to intensify the debate between electrification proponents who emphasise the need to curb planet-warming CO2 emissions, and carmakers who say a quick transition threatens jobs and profit.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global EV registrations, a proxy for sales, rose by 6% to almost 2.1 million units in December, reaching 20.7 million vehicles in 2025, the data showed.

They were up by 2% in China to more than 1.3 million, the lowest year-on-year increase since February 2024, leading to a 17% increase to 12.9 million units in 2025. The country produced 71% of EVs sold worldwide.

North American registrations fell by 39% to just over 100,000 cars sold, following similar declines in October and November at the end of U.S. tax credits. They were down 4% for the entire 2025.

Europe was up by 34% in December to over 450,000 registrations and by 33% in the year, while in the rest of the world sales were up by 41% to over 160,000 units in December, and by 48% in 2025.

WHAT'S NEXT

BMI expects 23.9 million EVs will be sold globally this year, a 15.7% increase, with growth sharply accelerating in China to 21% and slowing in Europe and the rest of the world to 15% and 26%, respectively. It forecasts a sharper decrease of 23% in North America due to a 29% slump in the U.S.

By Eric Starkman

General Motors disclosed in a late-2024 regulatory filing that it was facing litigation and other risks so severe that an adverse outcome could result in “significant” damages and even “interruptions of businesses.” It was a remarkable admission for a company already reeling from strategic whiplash. Yet the disclosure passed almost unnoticed, except by one veteran auto reporter, Phoebe Wall Howard.

That silence helps explain why GM CEO Mary Barra now speaks less like a corporate leader and more like a lawyer constructing a class-action defense in the wake of GM’s still-unfolding EV debacle.

On Monday, Barra told members of the Automotive Press Association that she has “no regrets” about GM’s electric-vehicle strategy, despite the company recording more than $7 billion in charges tied to abandoned EV plans and eliminating thousands of jobs because of a massive strategic misjudgment.

Same Decision

“Everything that we knew at that point in time we would have made the same decision,” Barra said, leaning on her familiar EV loyalty talking points. That’s the kind of statement one expects in litigation defense, not from an executive overseeing one of the most expensive strategic reversals in modern automotive history.

If there was any serious pushback to Barra’s claims, it did not appear in the coverage that followed. None of the reporting explained why GM committed to an all-electric future before it could profitably manufacture EVs, or why Toyota, long mocked for its EV restraint, correctly determined that American consumers were not ready to fully embrace electric vehicles.

It’s hard to imagine Japan’s auto writers asking Toyota’s leaders whether they have regrets about embracing hybrids, which are selling briskly, generating profits, and reducing emissions by as much as 30 percent. That Barra is paid roughly 80 percent more than Toyota’s CEO only makes her EV miscalculation more damning, a compensation disparity the auto press almost never notes when reporting on Barra.

Barra’s defenders will point to GM’s surging stock price as proof that her strategy has worked, even though part of that runup reflects the $25 billion in stock buybacks GM authorized over the past three years. A rising share price, however, does not negate a $7 billion EV write-down, thousands of lost jobs, or the decision to bury bad news in regulatory filings. Nor does it excuse a press corps that treats market approval as a substitute for scrutiny.

Barra also claimed that some GM gas-powered vehicles are more fuel-efficient than hybrids, a statement the Detroit Free Press reported without offering examples, perhaps because no one in the room pressed her for any. The claim was especially galling given that a climate-activist group ranked four GM vehicles, including the electric Hummer, among the 12 most environmentally harmful vehicles on the road. Toyota and its Lexus brand accounted for half of the greenest vehicles. GM did not place a single model on that list.

Toyota's Hybrids

Although Toyota’s fleet is already about 50 percent hybrid and Ford has announced a similar goal, Barra reportedly said GM is still “working on” its hybrid and plug-in strategy. That’s remarkable given that GM introduced the plug-in Chevy Volt in 2011, a pioneering vehicle that arrived well before the market was ready for it.

Developed under legendary GM executive Bob Lutz, the Volt was designed to drive primarily as an electric car, with a gasoline engine acting mainly as a generator once the battery was depleted. That architecture was novel at the time and gave early credibility to the idea that most daily driving could be electric years before charging infrastructure or consumer psychology caught up.

With about 40 miles of electric range, the Volt covered the daily commute for many Americans, allowing owners to go weeks or months without buying gas. In my West Los Angeles neighborhood, I see more Chevy Volts than any other GM vehicle, which makes sense given that every owner I’ve spoken with praises its reliability.

Barra killed the Volt in 2019 to focus on GM’s all-electric future. While she now insists EVs remain GM’s “North Star,” the company’s stock has surged largely because Barra has reassured Wall Street that GM will resume its focus selling highly profitable trucks and SUVs with enthusiasm.

One might have expected the auto media to arrive at Barra’s press conference prepared for tough questioning, especially after GM disclosed a $7.1 billion fourth-quarter loss tied largely to diminished EV and battery investments. Unlike Ford, which announced its $19.5 billion write-down in a separate release and whose CEO Jim Farley candidly acknowledged on Bloomberg Television that it “didn’t make sense to keep plowing billions into products that we knew would not make money,” GM disclosed its loss in a regulatory filing.

Available For Good News

Barra remains readily available to the media when GM has good news to share. When the company stumbles, she is far harder to find, a pattern that has gone largely unremarked upon despite how frequently those stumbles have occurred in recent years.

The pattern helps explain why the same auto press that failed to challenge Barra’s “no regrets” performance readily accepted the claim that the four floors GM has rented in Dan Gilbert’s Hudson’s Detroit office tower constitute the company’s headquarters.

A careful reading of the coverage of the official opening only reinforced my skepticism that the office is largely window dressing meant to create the impression that GM still maintains a meaningful Detroit presence.

For starters, of roughly a dozen executive offices, only four are permanently assigned — to Barra, President Mark Reuss, CFO Paul Jacobson, and Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton. I can find no confirmation that any of those executives will work from the Detroit office on a full-time basis and pay Detroit’s nonresident income tax.

GM has 16 corporate officers. That means 12 are not expected to spend enough time at “headquarters” to warrant an assigned office. That reality was absent from the media’s coverage.

Instead, GM’s senior leadership is scattered across the country. Sterling Anderson, who oversees product development, is based in the Bay Area, as is Lin-Hua Wu, who runs marketing and public relations. Chief People Officer Arden Hoffman lives in Montana and has conducted company calls from her ranch

Improve Collaboration?

Ed Nightingale, who oversees digital products and infrastructure, is based in Seattle. Zach Kirkman, GM’s recently appointed vice president of strategy and corporate development, is based in Austin.

Yet the claim that the Detroit office will improve collaboration was repeated by the auto press without scrutiny or context.

The contrast with GM’s West Coast priorities is hard to ignore. Barra attended the May 2024 opening of GM’s Mountain View Technical Center, where she declared, “This is going to be a very central hub for us.” Coverage of the Detroit office media tour, by contrast, made no mention of Barra’s presence.

At the Mountain View event, GM showcased executives it had recruited from Silicon Valley. One of them was Baris Cetinok, then vice president of product software and services, who proclaimed that “Detroit is the original Silicon Valley of the world.”

Cetinok left GM last November, one of four senior Silicon Valley-based executives whose tenures lasted two years or less.

Another speaker at the Mountain View opening was Marissa West, GM’s president of North America, who reiterated the company’s all-electric vision. West, a roughly 25-year GM veteran, left the company about eight months after being promoted to oversee North American operations.

Hudson’s Detroit reportedly cost $1.5 billion to develop. GM is occupying about 200,000 square feet — space that includes 14 conference rooms, 52 huddle rooms, 63 phone rooms, and three common areas. While Barra promotes GM as a technology company, its supposed headquarters is four floors of leased commercial office building space — a far cry from the kind of purpose-built environments associated with companies that actually operate like tech firms.

Ford's HQ

By contrast, Ford spent more than $1 billion on its new Dearborn headquarters, a 2.1-million-square-foot campus designed to accommodate 4,000 employees, with plans that will eventually place roughly 14,000 employees within a 15-minute walk.

Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, CEO Jim Farley, and former CEO Jim Hackett attended the official opening. Ford also spent more than $500 million restoring Michigan Central Station, a civic project for which it did not seek naming rights.

GM, by contrast, was previously obligated to maintain 4,000 headquarters jobs in Detroit as part of the $3.5 billion it received in state incentives. Governor Gretchen Whitmer relieved GM of that obligation in exchange for the company building electric trucks and SUVs at Factory Zero.

Tellingly, GM will not disclose how many employees will work at Hudson’s Detroit or how many will pay Detroit’s nonresident income tax. Factory Zero, the facility GM cited in exchange for being relieved of its headquarters job obligations, has already seen 1,100 workers laid off as the company retrenches from its electric-vehicle ambitions.

Gilbert received substantial tax breaks for Hudson’s Detroit, justified in part by promises that the development would attract new companies and jobs to the city. Meanwhile, the Detroit Regional CEO Group has named Barra and Reuss as co-chairs, despite GM’s continued downsizing of its Michigan workforce.

A headquarters without disclosed staffing, without full-time executive presence, and without accountability to the city that subsidized it is not a headquarters in any meaningful sense. It is a carefully branded installation — and the willingness of the auto press to treat it otherwise says far more about the state of automotive journalism than it does about GM’s supposed commitment to Detroit.

CASH FOR CARS: California’s relationship with Detroit is still frosty after automakers helped kill the state’s electric vehicle rules — but Gov. Gavin Newsom is betting that some cold, hard cash will help warm them up.

Newsom’s plan to balance the budget, released Friday, sets aside $200 million to prop up a new incentive program for electric vehicle buyers to help replace the $7,500 federal tax credit that the Trump administration eliminated last year.

It could help bolster the EV market, which industry analysts anticipate will soon start to flag in the face of rising car prices. But it could also help get automakers back to the negotiating table.

“We need to see the details of the new program, but this is a policy that has worked in the past,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers and successfully lobbied congressional Republicans to kill California’s nation-leading EV sales mandate in June. “At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California — and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country.”

Yes, automakers overwhelmingly opposed California’s vehicle emissions rule, which had required them to sell an increasing proportion of EVs each year. But they also weren’t pleased with President Donald Trump’s dismantling of Biden-era incentives for car buyers and battery manufacturing. (See Bozzella’s reference to “current market conditions,” which also includes the administration’s ongoing tariff policy.)

That dynamic opens a window in forthcoming negotiations on the proposal, which finance officials left vague and said they plan to hash out by February, that could thaw Newsom’s relationship with car companies — and keep the state’s climate goals on track — as he terms out of the governor’s mansion and looks towards higher office.

While Newsom has reserved his most pointed criticism for General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he’s repeatedly said in recent months “sold out” California, he hasn’t been afraid to issue barbs to the industry as a whole.

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate. “But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.”

Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details. Among the unanswered questions are who would qualify for the incentive and if there will be a cap on the price of EV models that are rebate-eligible. Companies like Rivian and Hyundai already weighed in during a series of California Air Resources Board workshops last year, advocating for a simple-to-use rebate without an income requirement.

“In our view, every $1,000 leads to a bump in EV registrations in the state,” Tom Van Heeke, Rivian’s senior policy adviser, said in November. “People respond to incentives.”

Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the state should work closely with the automakers to design an incentive program that gets more EVs on the road — and bury the hatchet in the process.

“I think this is a real opportunity for partnership,” she said.

Not all enviros are thrilled with the idea of handing the keys over to automakers.

Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air, said he’s encouraged by the inclusion of EV funding in the budget, but that incentives need to target low-income drivers who are more likely to need help covering the cost. And he recoiled at the idea of car manufacturers taking the leading role in designing the program.

“Now that they have bitten the hands that fed them, are they really expecting a handout?” Magavern said. “The program design should be based on what’s good for Californians, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and not be based on what’s good for large auto companies.”

One thing that Newsom’s budget omits: incentives for zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, which the state has also lost the authority to mandate and which have a disproportionate impact on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.

Trucking fleets and manufacturers argued during a November workshop that those incentives — which are typically snatched up the same day California opens applications — are the most important tool for transitioning to cleaner models.

FROM TRADE TO INVEST: It was Newsom’s big legislative lift last year, and now it’s regulators’ turn.

The California Air Resources Board on Tuesday released new draft rules for the state’s flagship cap-and-trade market (renamed cap-and-invest following its extension in a state law last year.) They’re proposing removing a third of the pollution permits they sell to industry through 2045, to get closer to meeting increasingly ambitious climate goals.

Environmentalists didn’t love it, arguing that CARB should have gone further in cutting emissions and raising more money for the state (fewer permits means each one is more valuable).

But affordability looms large. CARB staff said cost concerns ultimately drove the decision to aim for a 40 percent emissions cut by 2030, rather than the 48 percent regulators had previously considered.

“We are in a very different place politically and economically than we were two years ago,” CARB spokesperson Lindsay Buckley said, pointing in part to federal rollbacks under the Trump administration that have weakened incentives for climate projects.

But they’re still hoping to dramatically steepen the curve over time. From 2030 to 2045, CARB would remove another 899 million metric tons under the draft rules. They would also gradually lower the number of free permits given to natural gas suppliers and let utilities pass on the value of the allowances to customers based on actual energy use, rather than as a fixed bill credit.

Another part of the new rules aim to promote industrial decarbonization, including new categories for low-carbon cement production and a special incentive for manufacturers that lower emissions on-site.

The release of the draft rules sets up a period of back-and-forth with environmental advocates and industry before a planned vote by the board in the second quarter of 2026. — CvK

DRILL AWAY: The feds may open up more of California to oil and gas drilling.

The Bureau of Land Management published draft environmental analyses Monday concluding that new drilling on vast swaths of public land would not significantly harm public health or the environment, reports Ian Stevenson for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The analysis from the Bakersfield Field Office, which oversees 400,000 acres of federal land, predicts as many as 400 new wells per year. The Central Coast Field Office predicts up to 37 new wells in its area over 20 years; the office manages 250,000 acres of public land, as well as the mineral rights for more than 500,000 acres.

BLM is considering various leasing options after years of litigation over drilling in the region. Environmental groups sued over environmental impact statements released in 2019, during the first Trump administration, arguing BLM did not adequately consider environmental harms. That led to 2022 settlements in which BLM agreed to conduct further analyses — including of drilling techniques like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — while suspending new oil and gas leasing in the area.

The draft supplemental environmental impact statements will be open for public comment until early March. The program areas range from the San Francisco Bay Area south to the Los Angeles suburbs and east to Fresno and Bakersfield. — IS, NB

PAY YOUR WAY: Trump announced Monday that he’s teaming up with tech companies to keep data centers from driving up utility bills. Microsoft is first up.

The company pledged in a blog post to pay more for the electricity going to its data centers, reports Jason Plautz for POLITICO’s E&E News. Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that the company would ask utilities and regulators to set rates for the company’s data centers high enough to cover the costs of adding and using the electricity infrastructure needed. The company will also pay for new generation as well as improvements in transmission and distribution capabilities as needed.

“Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers,” Smith wrote.

As it so happens, the California Public Utilities Commission is poised to green-light during its Thursday meeting agreements between Microsoft and Pacific Gas & Electric to energize a new 90-megawatt data center in San Jose. Under the agreements, Microsoft will pay the upfront costs of connecting to the electricity grid. If the company follows through with getting the facility operational and purchasing energy from PG&E, then the utility would have 15 years to pay Microsoft back using ratepayer funds. — NB

BACKING THE BUS: Bay Area lawmakers are throwing their weight behind the region’s transit operators as negotiations with Newsom’s office over how to avert drastic service cuts drag on.

Fourteen state senators and assemblymembers, including Bay Area Caucus Chair Sen. Josh Becker, penned a Monday letter to Newsom in which they offered support for a plan that would use a piece of annual statewide transit dollars — funded by diesel fuel taxes — to issue loans for operating expenses. Bay Area transit operators made that counterproposal to the Department of Finance late last month, after Newsom’s administration suggested tapping into existing grants for long-term construction projects.

“We are concerned that, absent a clear commitment from the state to fully honor existing grant awards, the January 9th proposal from the Department of Finance could have unintended consequences for project schedules and matching funds, including approximately $6 billion in federal funding,” the lawmakers wrote.

DOF hasn’t laid out a timeline for approving a transit loan, but operators say a deal is needed well ahead of the July 1 start to the new budget year. BART has warned that it could reduce train service by 65 to 85 percent, while Muni projects a 50 percent cut. — AN

By Trilby MacDonald, Ecology Center Writer

Over many decades, Michigan nurtured talent, invested in R&D, and built the advanced manufacturing capabilities that launched the global auto industry. Today, the state is winding the mainsprings of its industrial legacy to spring into high-growth industries, such as renewable energy, semiconductors, autonomous driving, and electric vehicles. Strategic investments in workforce development and public-private partnerships are helping strong companies reach new heights.

These investments are paying off. According to Fast Company, jobs in clean energy and electric vehicles are growing nearly four times faster than the state’s economy as a whole — with employment in EV manufacturing up 13% in 2025, smart-grid modernization up 6.9%, and solar energy up 5.6%. Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the U.S., and is in third place for semiconductor jobs.

Why are Michigan’s labor force and population declining?

Many of these good jobs are going unfilled because we don’t have enough qualified workers. Meanwhile, workers and young people move to other states in search of jobs they can fill. The policy imperative is clear: prepare our workforce to fill open jobs or lose opportunity to other states. The state is not sitting on its heels. Key agencies have matched Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding to upskill its workforce through over a dozen programs.

In the first year of the Statewide Workforce Plan, launched in early 2024, The Economic Development Corporation’s Talent Action Team connected 1,748 people directly to good-paying high-tech roles and trained an additional 1,291 workers. Labor and Economic Development (LEO) served more than 9,500 businesses across the state, helping them recruit talent and increase their competitiveness, and served more than 336,000 Michiganders with workforce development support, the most of any state in the Midwest. Further, millages have been passed in many areas to educate K-12 students in careers in technical education, including Washtenaw County.

How did we fall behind?

The energy crisis of the 1970s spurred massive federal investment in the research and development of alternative energy, including solar, wind, and natural gas. It led to the creation of the Department of Energy and a raft of tax incentives and supportive policies that allowed the sector to flourish. President Jimmy Carter even put solar panels on the roof of the White House. America was leading the world in the development of green technologies our scientists invented, including solar panels and electric vehicles.

All of that momentum came to an end when Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office after a successful campaign paid for in large part by the fossil fuel industry. In the name of limited government and free market capitalism, he dismantled the policies and programs that nurtured the growing industries, including the symbolic removal of President Carter’s solar panels from the White House roof. Renewable energy and EV development came to a grinding halt. But where Reagan-era conservatives saw costly government programs, countries like Germany and China saw economic opportunity, and now our industries are eating their dust.

We are experiencing the same cycle of investment, disinvestment, and missed opportunity again.

The Biden Administration made the largest investment in renewable energy and technology innovation in the nation’s history with the Inflation Reduction Act, investing hundreds of billions of dollars to jump start the industry. It gave rise to new companies, expansions of existing industries, and major infrastructure projects across all 50 states.

And now the Trump Administration is attempting to reverse that progress. Not only was the U.S. absent from the UN Climate Change Conference in November, we are seeing a freeze in new R&D funding for clean energy technology and the illegal clawback of billions in federal dollars approved by Congress for climate-related projects. Tariffs on products connected with renewable energy and electric vehicles create more economic uncertainty, further discouraging businesses from pursuing clean energy and technology projects. According to Climate Power, 158,000 clean energy jobs have been lost across the U.S. since Trump took office for his second term, 6,000 of them in Michigan.

Not surprisingly, the oil and gas industries were among Trump’s top campaign contributors.

States like Michigan are running hard to stay in the lead of the clean energy transition. Part of our strategy to stay competitive are strong cross-sectoral collaborations between state, corporate, and nonprofit partners to create the workforce we need to keep industries and talent here. We need to keep this momentum going so that young people will see their future in Michigan.

Disconnect between workers and jobs

Roughly 26,000 new clean energy and clean vehicle jobs have been created since 2022, part of over 127,000 in the state, according to The Clean Jobs Midwest Report. This growth is partly the result of major federal policies like the 2022 IRA that incentivized private sector initiatives and a raft of supportive state legislation. Michigan lawmakers created the 2022 MI Healthy Climate Plan, which built a policy framework to pursue a clean energy transition, and the 2023 clean energy legislation including workforce development. However, the number of new jobs created falls short of the Whitmer administration’s projections—and it’s nowhere near enough to offset Michigan’s shrinking labor force, which lost 45,000 workers between March and September of 2025, according to the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget.

The gap between projected and actual job growth is due to a few factors, including automation, project cancellations caused by tariffs and unfavorable policies, and lack of qualified candidates.

With so many people out of work, it’s hard to believe that 88% percent of clean energy employers in Michigan report at least some difficulty hiring workers, according to a 2023 report by Clean Jobs Midwest. Michigan is facing shortages in several types of jobs, including EV manufacturing and maintenance technicians, battery engineers, energy efficiency specialists, solar and wind power installers, HVAC and building automation techs, and skilled trades tied to clean infrastructure. The Michigan Growth Office and Make Michigan Home program are working to attract people with those skills to live in the state. But rather than import qualified workers, wouldn’t it be better to train local workers for these positions?

Closing the employment gap: when opportunity meets preparation

The cost to replace an employee can range from half to twice the position’s annual salary, according to Gallup. As industries change to meet shifting market demands, corporations that invest in their talent pool save money, have higher retention, and are more nimble in a shifting market. Transitioning a workforce requires an upfront investment, and that’s where state leadership is key. Government agencies including the Michigan Infrastructure Office, Office of Labor and Economic Development, and Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) are partnering with corporations, nonprofits, and higher education to deliver apprenticeships and training programs that allow the workers of today to qualify for jobs in construction, energy efficiency, and cutting edge industries that would otherwise go to workers outside of the state.

The private, nonprofit, and government sectors each bring unique tools and expertise to close the employment gap:

Private Sector

Innovates to meet emerging market demands

Develops curricula and technical training

Offers on-the-job training and career pathways

Provides paid apprenticeships

Community-Based Organizations, Labor Unions & Higher Education

Identify and recruit prospective participants

Provide training and credentialing

Offer wraparound services (transportation vouchers, stipends, childcare) that make training accessible

Offer coaching and case management to help workers navigate barriers

Track participant progress and outcomes to refine programs

Government Agencies

Establish policies and regulatory frameworks

Provide funding for workforce development

Incentivise collaboration by high-road companies, including mandates and contracting preferences

Build connections between sectors to support coordinated transitions

Align training investments with statewide climate, energy, and economic transition goals

The Continuous Partner Collaboration Cycle model is one method to coordinate the public, private, and nonprofit sectors by fostering just transitions through social dialogue and refinement of training programs to keep up with advancements in green technologies and labor market conditions. The Midwest Air Source Heat Pump Collaborative uses the CPCC model, aligning training with market demands and policy goals, preparing workers for emerging green tech and energy sectors through shared tools, data, and feedback loops.

Predictive workforce planning can better align training programs with climate action plans by using data to forecast the supply and demand of skills and workers needed for emerging green sectors. Tracking labor markets and creating feedback loops between employers, educational institutions, and training providers allows collaborators to adjust workforce development strategies proactively.

Germany’s dual system is an example of a national strategy that runs apprenticeships and vocational training programs within a strong public, private, union partnership dating back to the Middle Ages. Companies have found that the best way to recruit highly skilled personnel that fit their cultures is to provide apprenticeships and on the job training. Meanwhile, state-sponsored vocational schools provide the classroom education and theoretical framework to support hands-on learning. The system works so well that 50% of high school graduates that don’t go to college enter the trades through this program.

I want to thank the Pride of The Orange marching band. The best marching band in the country as far as I’m concerned. I want to acknowledge the leader of the Senate, Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie — two extraordinary leaders I consider incredible partners as we chart the path forward for New York.

Our protector, Attorney General Tish James. Keeper of the coffers, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. From Buffalo, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes. Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt. Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay. Judges of the New York Court of Appeals. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. And Mayors and County Executives from across the State.

Representatives from labor and distinguished guests. Members of my Cabinet. Secretary Karen Persichilli Keogh and the Executive Chamber senior team.

And I’m very proud to acknowledge New York’s very first ever First Gentleman, my husband, William Hochul.

Today, on this 13th day of 2026, we will embark on a journey together. A State of the State address is a chance to look to the future. But this year calls for us to reflect on something bigger than this moment:

The origins of our nation, founded 250 years ago this year, and how that history shapes where we are and where we must go from here.

From the very beginning, New Yorkers have always been a rather rebellious lot, willing to take on forces larger than ourselves in the cause of liberty and freedom.

That resilience, that strength, that spirit, that willingness to fight for a better future was born in secret meetings in the taverns of Albany and New York CIty — charting a path forward under the weight of an oppressive power.

And later, with New York as our country’s first capital, our bold revolutionary leaders became the governing leaders of a New Nation with unlimited possibilities.

Over my four years as your Governor listening to your stories, feeling the pulse of this great state, I have seen that same strength, the resilience, the optimism that defined New Yorkers 250 years ago.

As I shaped our agenda for 2026 and beyond, I kept returning to my conversations with New Yorkers from every corner of the state — people who refuse to back down on their dreams.

People like Theresa Durham, a Syracuse grandmother I was lucky enough to meet last May.

Thanks to our housing policies, Theresa just fulfilled her lifelong dream of owning a home.

People like Deborah Koenigsberger who owns a clothing boutique in the Flatiron District.

Her business is getting hit so hard by Trump’s tariffs. And somehow, she’s making it work while leading a nonprofit that supports homeless women and children.

I think of people like 14-year-old Joziah Morales, who found the courage to seek help when he was struggling with his mental health. Today, he’s out there sharing his inspiring story, reminding his peers it’s okay to accept a helping hand.

So when I say your family is my fight, these are the people I’m talking about.

I carry their stories and those of countless others with me, because I’ve lived my own version of them. Growing up in a cramped home just outside Buffalo, sharing a drafty attic bedroom with my brothers, doing homework late at night by a space heater after finishing a shift at the local pizzeria not knowing where my path would lead. But I learned when people work hard, and when someone has their back, it can change the course of their entire life.

That’s why I believe with my whole heart that government can and must be a force for good. And over the last four years, we’ve proven it. We took our State emerging from a crisis and powered a comeback that few believed was possible.

Crime is down in the places New Yorkers feel it most. Our streets, our subways, our communities are safer than they’ve been in years.

We also know people need a safe place to live. That’s why we secured the most significant housing deal in half a century so young families can put down roots.

We expanded child care, capped the cost of insulin and launched the nation’s very first paid prenatal leave program.

We also made historic investments in clean energy, chips manufacturing and advanced technology, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. And the impact is undeniable.

Retail is surging. More college graduates are moving to New York than anywhere else in the country. We’re leading the nation in return-to-office. From Babylon to Buffalo, New York is rising.

If you’re betting on the future, you need to bet on New York. If you’re searching for talent, you find it in New York. If you’re looking for the epicenter of culture, innovation, opportunity, it has always been and remains New York.

My friends, I am proud to say: The State of our State is strong! And we’re just getting started.

But I need to level with you: This moment carries real threats from Donald Trump and his enablers in Congress. Driving up costs on everything from groceries to farm equipment through these reckless tariffs. Killing major infrastructure projects that put union members to work. Tearing nursing immigrant mothers from their babies and calling it public safety.

And just last week, the world watched as an immigration operation in Minneapolis that never should have happened — left a child without a mother, and a community, and indeed a nation, shattered.

It’s all part of an agenda that only makes our lives harder.

Well, here’s the thing about New Yorkers: We don’t back down. We rise up.

When they tried to take away funding for first responders and law enforcement, we made them restore it. When they tried to kill congestion pricing, we beat them in court again and again. The President even made another threatening post less than 24 hours ago. But my message to the wannabe king remains the same: We will not bow.

Yes, this is a year of real uncertainty driven by reckless federal policies. Washington’s chaos is hitting our bottom line. But we’ve built the boat to withstand the storm. Because we’ve managed our money responsibly. We’re able to make transformative investments in our future. Without raising taxes. Without saddling the next generation with mounds of debt.

Four years ago, we laid out a bold vision. I took responsibility for making it real.

And in 2026, we’re seeing the results.

Clean hydropower flowing in from Quebec to power more than a million New York City homes.

Long-stalled housing projects rising from the ground.

A new stadium bringing pride and investment to Western New York. Go Bills!

The brand new Belmont Park carrying racing into the future.

The World Cup, drawing soccer fans from across the globe.

Critical infrastructure being rebuilt, from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to our bridges and tunnels.

Expanding the Second Avenue Subway even further.

And with the Interborough Express, we’ll connect Queens and Brooklyn like never before.

Even the renovations at Penn Station long dreamed of are on a path forward.

Families will get more breathing room.

Another minimum wage hike.

Better paid family leave. A child tax credit up to $1,000 and the lowest middle class tax rates in 70 years. Let me repeat, the lowest in 70 years! And we lifted a major burden for businesses, paying off billions in unemployment insurance debt while increasing benefits by 70 percent.

That’s a critical safety net for anyone who finds themselves out of work.

What else can we look forward to in 2026?

World-renowned companies reinvigorating communities long overlooked: Micron in Onondaga County shovels in the ground not 3 years from now, but 3 days from now! GlobalFoundries in Saratoga County. Fairlife in Monroe County. Chobani in Oneida County.

These wins are the results of fights we took on investments we made and a future we chose together. And when I say “together,” that includes my great partners in state government who are with us today. And it also means the local leaders who work around the clock keeping our towns and cities running.

Let’s hear from some of them.

As your Governor, I am proud to lead the fight to protect communities and build an economy that works for all! And today I’m here to tell you how we continue that fight, and it starts with making life more affordable.

Whether we’re talking about child care, groceries or utility bills, one thing is clear: Parents, veterans and seniors need relief. That’s why, last year alone working with the Legislature, we put $5,000 back in the pockets of hardworking families.

But now, Washington Republicans are waging an all-out war on the middle class: Driving up costs and leaving states to pick up the pieces. So this year, while Washington takes a machete to our safety net, I’m doubling down on the fight for a more affordable New York starting with child care.

For working parents, no cost is more overwhelming. I know how urgent this is because I’ve lived it.

When my husband Bill and I were starting out, child care was one of our greatest obstacles. I was fresh out of law school working my dream job on Capitol Hill with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But when our babies arrived, I had to give that career up simply because we could not find affordable child care.

It was heartbreaking.

It was tough then. And for too many families today, it’s almost impossible.

Get this: In New York City, child care costs between $26,000 and $40,000 a year. For that price, your toddler should be fluent in three languages and doing your taxes.

One year ago, I stood on this very stage and placed our state on the path to Universal Child care. Today, I stand before you with a clear roadmap to show how we’ll get there. Building on over $8 billion in child care investments that my Administration has made since 2022, this plan will ultimately deliver Universal Child care for every single family in New York.

Full stop.

The work has already begun. Five days ago, I stood with Mayor Mamdani to announce the State will fully fund the first two years of his Universal 2-Care program while also helping New York City realize the full promise of Universal 3-K.

Statewide, we’re taking a different, but equally ambitious approach:

Universal Pre-K for every single 4 year old by 2028!

This year, we’ll also pilot community-wide child care to provide year-round, full-day, affordable care for newborns to 3 year olds.

And we’ll build on the proven success of our State Child Care Assistance Program and our voucher system so tens of thousands more families can access high-quality care for no more than $15 per week.

Thanks to our strong economy, we have the revenue to get these initiatives off the ground.

But to keep our momentum going, we need partnership from the private sector.

So we’ll work with employers and improve tax incentives for those who invest in child care benefits. We want New York to be the number one place for anyone about to start a family and build their future.

When that happens, we all win.

Our classrooms are fuller.

Our economy is stronger.

And our communities are richer in every sense of the word.

But affordability doesn’t stop at child care. Right now, the average New York household pays nearly $1,700 per year just to keep the lights on and the heat running. And Donald Trump’s stop-work order on offshore wind will only make it worse in the long run.

I’m fighting it every step of the way.

But while that battle continues we’re taking action now streamlining utility assistance helping homeowners make energy efficient upgrades and protecting New Yorkers from being blindsided by exorbitant rate hikes.

We can make energy more affordable and reliable today while still leading the nation in sustainable investments, leaving this state stronger for our children and grandchildren.

And there’s another affordability issue that’s been apparent for years: The sky-high cost of auto insurance.

Because in many parts of our state, owning an automobile is not a luxury, it’s essential. Yet, New Yorkers pay the highest auto insurance rates in the nation, averaging $4,000 a year — $1,500 more than the national average. Not because New Yorkers are doing anything wrong, but because rampant fraud and runaway litigation costs are jacking up prices.

Let’s be clear about how that happens. When the system allows out-of-control payouts. Those costs get passed on to you in the form of higher monthly bills.

New Yorkers should not pay more for the same coverage. And this is the year, we’re going to do something about it.

We’re putting the brakes on fraud and ending a system that rewards illegal behavior. If you were driving drunk, driving without a license, or committing a felony at the time of a crash, you should not get a payday.

This is about finally standing up for millions of New York drivers who deserve a break.

And this year, we’ll continue cracking down on criminals of all kinds.

When I came into office, New York was facing a crisis of crime and disorder.

In the two years before I arrived, shootings had nearly doubled. Repeat offenders were cycling in and out of the criminal justice system. And too many people felt unsafe.

I promised New Yorkers to do everything in my power to restore safety and security.

We backed that promise with action. We made unprecedented investments in police and public safety over $3 billion. We enacted the strongest gun laws in the nation along with common sense reforms to keep serial lawbreakers off the streets and stop criminals from walking free on technicalities.

We equipped police with the best technology, deployed more officers in our subway, formed specialized units to crack down on retail theft and domestic violence.

Four years later, crime is hitting record lows. Shootings, homicides and subway crime all down

But we will never be satisfied. This year, we’re building on what works using data, coordination and smart enforcement to stay ahead of criminals.

We’ll expand our successful network of Crime Analysis Centers statewide. On our subways, we’ll maintain enhanced police patrols, install platform barriers at 85 additional stations and expand our elite mental health units that get people in crisis off the train and into care.

We’ve stemmed the tide of firearms flowing into our state along the iron pipeline. And now, we’re taking aim at the plastic pipeline.

Illegal 3-D printed ghost guns are homemade killing machines assembled with pieces you can easily purchase. To fight back, I’m proposing a first-in-the-nation law requiring ALL 3-D printers sold in the State of New York to include software that blocks the printer from creating a gun.

And we’re putting gun manufacturers on notice: You will no longer sell handguns that can be converted into automatic machine guns — that are able to fire 1,200 rounds per minute.

Not here. Not in New York. That’s how we save lives and fight crime.

As we reflect on freedoms fought for 250 years ago, among them is the freedom to practice your religion without interference.

In 2026, we’ll take new steps to protect our houses of worship against the rising tide of Antisemitism and Islamophobia. New York has already invested $131 million to better secure these sacred places. But clearly, more must be done.

Just last week, protestors led pro-Hamas chants outside a Synagogue in Kew Gardens Hills. That’s not free expression. That’s harassment. And targeting a Jewish community in this way is antisemitism.

That’s why I’m proposing a ban on protests within 25 feet of the property line at houses of worship. So those who simply want to pray can do so without fear or harassment.

My responsibility for keeping New Yorkers safe extends to protecting our children as well.

We’ve taken on Big Tech and passed nation-leading laws. So kids will no longer be subjected to addictive algorithms that manipulate their minds.

They will no longer be targets for mega- corporations monetizing their mental health. And now when the school day begins, their phones are tucked away under our bell-to-bell ban.

In just four months, the transformation has been extraordinary.

Classrooms are alive with discussion. Laughter fills our lunchrooms. And Frankie Focus haunts our childrens’ dreams.

Building on our success, I say we enact new requirements to protect all social media users under 18: Let’s block direct messages from would-be child predators with automatic privacy settings. Let’s disable A-I chatbots that can cause serious mental health problems.

Let’s block location-sharing and let’s do more to cut off access to online sports gambling so our kids are not ensnared by addiction at a young age.

You’ve heard me say that our communities cannot reach their full potential without an abundant supply of safe, affordable housing.

For too long, over-burdensome regulations made it too hard not just to build homes but the places people work and the infrastructure our future depends upon.

That’s why four years ago I made a commitment: To challenge the status quo, cut red tape and clear the way to build, build, build!

Working with the Legislature, we took on a system that was failing our families and passed the most significant housing deal in 50 years!

We made it clear: Standing still is no longer an option. The result? We saved over 71,000 homes that were at risk of being scrapped.

And we opened the door for another 800,000 over the next decade!

We’ve funded shovel-ready projects, strengthened tenant protections, turned vacant properties into homes and protected rent-regulated housing.

Local governments are stepping up, too. Over 400 pro-housing communities have agreed to build more homes because we lead with carrots. not sticks.

Under my approach, communities that say yes to housing get access to $750 million in state funding.

We’re changing the culture around building brick by brick.

This year we'll invest an additional $250 million for affordable housing and $100 million to scale innovative, manufactured housing that lowers costs and speeds construction.

And we’ll update tax incentives to help owners of rent-regulated buildings in New York City make repairs and investments.

Meanwhile, we'll crack down on the worst landlords with increased penalties and strengthen rent relief for seniors and New Yorkers with disabilities.

But as far as we’ve come, too many projects still get stuck.

Not because they’re bad ideas but because the system itself has become the obstacle.

Even projects everyone agrees we need affordable housing, clean energy. Critical infrastructure can spend years trapped in red tape pushing up costs and pushing opportunity further out of reach.

So this year, we’re taking a hard look at environmental review processes that haven’t been updated in literally half a century.

Right now, they slow down the very projects that help us fight climate change, create housing and strengthen our communities.

That’s why, in this budget, I’m proposing a simple, common-sense update: When communities say yes to housing, infrastructure, or clean energy, we’re going to LET THEM BUILD!

When a town or city decides to move forward they shouldn’t get stuck in regulatory hell.

Cutting red tape doesn’t end at the construction site, it extends to government as well.

This year, we’ll also eliminate outdated and onerous regulations and leverage cutting-edge technology to make government work better.

But we’ll also do it the old-fashioned way, talking to small business owners and other impacted New Yorkers about the bureaucratic barriers that are holding them back.

People deserve to know their tax dollars are being spent wisely and their government is operating efficiently.

And we’re bringing that same productivity as we build the jobs of the future.

Today the Empire State is home to over 8.5 million private sector jobs, almost a million more than when I took office.

And now we’re forging ahead tapping into the creativity that has always defined our state.

200 years ago the Erie Canal made New York an industrial powerhouse. It sustained generations of manufacturing jobs and entire communities.

But when those jobs were shipped overseas in the ‘70s, communities like mine paid the price.

I remember the year the steel plant shut down in Buffalo and the toll it took. I saw it in the bustling businesses gone dark. In the drawn faces I passed on the sidewalk drained of hope.

None of my siblings could find a job.

They couldn’t stay in Western New York.

That taught me a lesson I’ve never forgotten: New York should never be left at the mercy of decisions made far away with no regard for people here at home.

So we’re ushering in a rebirth of manufacturing one that’s built to last. In 2022, we enacted the nation’s largest semiconductor incentive program ensuring the defining technology of our time would be built in New York by New Yorkers.

We’re already landing the world’s largest chipmakers.

But we must ensure these fantastic opportunities are within reach for all not reserved for a select few.

That’s why we’re investing over half a billion dollars to help New Yorkers gain the skills they need to succeed.

It starts with the fundamentals.

That’s why two years ago I took on entrenched interests and insisted that we go back to basics teaching kids how to read and doing away with ineffective methods.

We took on that fight and we won.

This year we’ll take the same approach with math preparing the next generation for the jobs of tomorrow.

And for those who want to embark on a new career, we launched free community college for adult learners pursuing high-demand careers from health care to advanced manufacturing.

Since last summer, more than 11,000 people have enrolled.

This year let’s expand that opportunity even further adding new fields like logistics, air traffic control and emergency management.

And speaking of preparing for the future, we must plan for the energy that industries require.

Last summer, I took the bold step of greenlighting the first nuclear power project in a generation, a vital part of our all-of-the-above approach to energy.

At the time we set a goal of building one gigawatt of nuclear power.

But if there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home.

So I’ve decided to raise the bar to five gigawatts.

That’s more nuclear energy than has been built anywhere in the United States in the last 30 years!

And to make sure New Yorkers are ready, we’ll launch a nuclear workforce development program so we can forge our clean energy future together.

Let me be clear: our energy system exists to serve New Yorkers first.

Data centers are vital for an innovative future. But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill.

So if they want to build in New York, they’ll have to pay their fair share for the power they use and ultimately generate their own power independently.

Because we will not allow technology to undermine our infrastructure, and we won’t let it undermine our democracy, either.

People deserve to trust what they see and hear during election season. So this year we’ll require disclosures on all AI-generated images and videos so New Yorkers know what’s real and what’s not.

And we’ll strengthen our existing laws to prohibit deepfakes that impersonate candidates, deceive voters and manipulate elections.

So take a good look at these guns cause it’s the last time you’re gonna see them.

All jokes aside, New York has always been a place where fundamental rights are vigorously defended.

And at a moment when those rights are under direct attack, New York is doing what we’ve always done: We’re standing firm.

When Roe v. Wade was overturned, we acted immediately protecting abortion access and shielding patients and providers from political persecution.

We enshrined the Equal Rights Amendment in the State Constitution and strengthened one of the nation’s oldest Human Rights laws.

But over the last year, that record has come under siege by the Trump administration.

One of the clearest examples of what’s at stake is the right to health care. Republicans in Washington want to drive up premiums, deny coverage, and force families to choose between seeing a doctor and paying their rent.

Here in New York we are fighting like hell to stop them. This year, we’ll protect affordable health care for more than 1.3 million New Yorkers. And we’re also protecting access to lifesaving vaccines.

Last year, when pharmacies began turning people away I declared an emergency and expanded who can prescribe and administer vaccines so no New Yorker is left unprotected.

This year, I’ll go further ensuring New York’s immunization standards are set by trusted medical experts, not conspiracy theorists!

And protecting New Yorkers also means standing up to ICE agents who abuse their power.

New York is a state that was built by immigrants, people like my own grandparents from Ireland who fled great poverty.

And we don’t forget where we came from.

Over the past year, communities across New York from farms in Sacketts Harbor to factories in Cayuga County to high schools on Long Island have been shaken by aggressive federal immigration actions that go too far.

Just yesterday they arrested an analyst at New York City Hall. An analyst with legal work authorization.

Is this person really one of the baddest of the bad? Is this person really a threat?

I will do whatever it takes to protect New Yorkers from criminals, but people of all political beliefs are saying the same thing about what we’ve seen lately: enough is enough.

New York will not allow the use of State resources to assist in federal immigration raids on people who have not committed serious crimes.

Public safety will always come first, but it must be pursued lawfully and with humanity.

We will not allow masked federal ICE agents to storm into our schools, daycares, hospitals, and houses of worship for civil immigration raids unless they have a judicial warrant, meaning signed by a judge.

And when boundaries are crossed, accountability matters. No one from the president on down is above the law.

Let me repeat: No one.

That’s why I will move to allow New Yorkers to hold ICE agents accountable in court when they act outside the scope of their duties.

This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety.

It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.

And if someone’s constitutional rights are violated here in the state of New York, I say they deserve their day in court.

And no matter what happens in Washington, no matter who’s in the White House, rest assured: Your family and your future are my fight.

History has proven when freedom is on the line New York shows up.

Beginning with the ordinary people who stood up and fought when their freedoms and values were under attack over 250 years ago.

We are the patriots (no, not those Patriots) who forged a new nation.

We are the people who shed blood at Saratoga, blazed a trail from Seneca Falls, demanded dignity at Stonewall.

When the American experiment is put to the test, when the path ahead is dark, it is New Yorkers who light the way forward.

Some of the challenges before us today are very similar to those New Yorkers faced 250 years ago.

Others are new. The battles may look different, but there’s one thing that never changes: And that is the unbreakable spirit and toughness of the people of this state.

You see it every single day. The police officer from Pelham Bay patrolling the streets through the night allowing the rest of us to sleep safely.

Teachers encouraging students to pursue their dreams like my 8th grade social studies teacher Mr. James back at Hamburg Middle School.

The nurse from the North Country who puts her kids to bed before heading to the hospital for the overnight shift.

The fifth generation dairy farmer from Wyoming County up before dawn knowing that people are depending on him for their daily existence.

Different callings, one shared purpose. Showing up, standing guard, doing the work day after day. That’s the legacy we must uphold.

And I believe 250 years from now people will look back on this moment and ask: Did we fight for and uphold our most fundamental values? Did we protect New York as a beacon of opportunity for people all over the world, a place where you can have a family without being crushed by bills, where you can afford a home, where you can start a business or work a farm without being destroyed by tariffs?

Did we properly invest in education, knowing that an educated populace may be our best defense against tyranny?

And when long cherished rights were stripped away and our very democracy was threatened, did we stand up and protect them?

To each of these questions, I know that New Yorkers will accept no answer other than a resounding YES.

That is the essence of my 2026 State of the State.

In the weeks ahead, working with Leader Stewart Cousins and Speaker Heastie we’ll find even more ways to deliver for New Yorkers just as we’ve done these past five years.

Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that when New Yorkers move forward with strength and compassion side by side there is no challenge we cannot meet, no tyrant we cannot beat and no future we cannot build.

So let’s build that future together with enthusiasm, optimism, and fearlessness.

And to conclude, I say this: let’s go Bills!

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies

We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.

HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration’s goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states’ power. President Donald Trump’s first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what’s called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,” said Jess Kramer, EPA’s assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren’t sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump’s first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes’ authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate” the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government’s power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Congress has said that when federally backed projects like oil pipelines or nickel mines affect water quality, fishing and drinking water, states and tribes get to review them and reject proposals that will do too much damage, according to Moneen Nasmith, director of national climate, fossil fuel infrastructure at the nonprofit Earthjustice.

“EPA’s claims that states and tribes are overreaching are baseless,” she said. “This proposed rule is trying to solve for a problem that does not exist.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars” like restoring America’s energy dominance — Trump’s shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

We applaud Senator Merkley and Representative Levin for introducing these bills and urge Congress to pass this legislation that helps to protect taxpayer dollars from funding Big Polluters.”

The demonstration facility is set to begin production in mid-2028 and could pave the way for an eventual $850 million plant.","Private equity companies and the federal government are planning to make a $450 million investment in the Atlantic Alumina plant near Gramercy, a move officials say will allow the facility to boost production and clean up longstanding environmental issues.

Concord Resource Holdings and its majority shareholder, Pinnacle Asset Management, will put up more than $300 million for the plant and the Department of Defense will invest $150 million, said David LaPlante, a consultant working on the project.

The money will allow Atalco to bring alumina production up to the 1 million pounds it is capable of delivering. Right now, the plant is producing below that level due to attrition of equipment, LaPlante said.

Founded in 1959 by Kaiser Aluminum, the refinery extracts alumina from red bauxite ore. Alumina is smelted and used to make aluminum and it also has a number of uses in the defense, aerospace and automotive supply chain.

Over the years, alumina production has shifted to China because of what chemical industry officials have labeled as unfair trade practices. The Gramercy facility is the last alumina refinery in the U.S.

The investment will allow the plant to keep its current 500 jobs and will lead to some additional hiring, when a gallium production facility opens at the plant. It will be the first large-scale gallium production facility in the U.S., capable of producing up to 50 million metric tons a year. Gallium is used to make semiconductors.

The exact number of new jobs that will be created by the gallium production facility has not been determined and the timetable for construction is not known yet.

In a joint statement, Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois praised the investment as advancing national security while supporting advanced manufacturing.

""This announcement marks a significant win for Louisiana and for the nation. Atalco’s $450 million strategic partnership with the United States government will revitalize a critical industrial facility, retain skilled jobs and position America to produce essential materials domestically at a time when supply chain security has never been more important,"" the statement says.

The investment will also allow Atalco to address environmental issues that have plagued the facility. Massive waste piles, which are as tall as buildings, lie in hundreds of acres along the Mississippi River. The piles have been a source of dust complaints and caustic liquid leaks.

A Southeastern Louisiana University researcher said runoff from the red mud is a potential source of heavy metal and other pollutants in Lake Maurepas and leaks may also be reaching the Blind River. Atalco has rejected those suggestions.

“This facility has been in survival mode and staying alive under pressure,” LaPlante said, which means it hasn’t been able to invest in environmental and health and safety issues like it wants to.

Already some effects from the investment are being seen at the facility. Instead of staking up piles of red mud, water is now being squeezed out of the waste, creating a hard dry material, much like pavement. That allows flat, compacted layers of waste to be stacked up on one another “like a Doberge cake”, said Renwick Deville, another consultant on the project. That eliminates issues with dust and liquid runoff.

The new investment would be the second at Atalco in the past month that supporters said will reduce the waste at the plant. ElementUSA said it will build a demonstration plant that will extract ""gallium, scandium, iron and other critical minerals"" from the piles of red mud. The demonstration facility is set to begin production in mid-2028 and could pave the way for an eventual $850 million plant.

The Atalco upgrades and ElementUSA's demonstration plant will complement each other, LaPlante and Deveille said.

But MaryLee Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, which filed a lawsuit in federal court late last year over the ponds of red mud waste at Atalco, said questions remain about the expansion, given the plant's troubling track record.

""Of course, it is a positive to remove a hazardous material from their waste stream and put it to good and needed use. But will it be done in a way that is protective of the workers, the community, and the environment,"" she said in a statement.

Pollution, health, and long-term impacts

While the facility would replace an older coal plant, opponents argue that natural gas still produces pollution and could affect air quality and health across the Lowcountry. Activists say once built, the plant could operate for 30 to 40 years — further locking South Carolina into fossil fuels and slowing the transition to cleaner energy sources.

“That community already dealt with increased rates of asthma and cancer,” said Belvin Olasov, director of the Charleston Climate Coalition. “Now we have more fossil fuel polluting industry trying to move into the exact same spot to further deepen those health wounds.”

Opponents also say the plant’s proximity to the Edisto River raises concerns beyond Colleton County, including potential impacts to downstream drinking water supplies used by the Charleston region.

Questions about data centers and energy demand

Some protesters are questioning whether the proposed plant is being built in part to support growing electricity demand from data centers.

“The reason we’re being told we need this energy isn’t just organic growth from people moving here,” Olasov said. “The reason is primarily data centers.”

Dominion Energy disputes that claim, saying it has not attributed the need for the new power plant to data centers and that a proposed data center in Colleton County is not located within its service area.

Dominion Energy response

In a statement, Dominion Energy said the Canadys Station is critical in meeting increased customer demand for electricity and supporting economic prosperity in South Carolina, which it notes is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation. The company said the facility would use proven technology and state-of-the-art environmental protections, calling the natural gas plant a reliable and highly efficient source of energy that will help secure South Carolina’s energy future.

Dominion Energy said the Canadys site was selected because of its established footprint, which would eliminate the need to acquire and clear large areas of new land. The site is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Charleston in Colleton County and is positioned at what the company described as the energy intersection of the Lowcountry, with strong electric transmission connectivity to major load centers and proximity to existing and planned Santee Cooper transmission lines.

The company also emphasized that the facility would incorporate advanced air-cooling technology, resulting in exceptionally efficient use of water resources and minimal impacts to the Edisto River or groundwater. According to Dominion Energy, the Canadys Station would use about 90 percent less water than the retired coal-fired generating plant that previously operated at the site.

What happens next

Environmental groups say Tuesday’s protest is only the beginning and are calling on regulators to reject the proposal and explore alternative energy solutions.

“Our ask to Dominion is to go back to the drawing board,” Olasov said. “We think Dominion needs to commission a real study into the feasibility of investing in other fuels instead of pushing a massive gas plant through too fast.”

The final decision now rests with the South Carolina Public Service Commission, which is expected to determine whether the project will move forward on April 14.",https://abcnews4.com/resources/media2/16x9/800/1320/0x75/90/a98346f0-5037-4380-a0d9-4c80149b9371-Image.jfif,N,,2026-01-13 22:12:35.294147

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency says it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs and preventable deaths avoided from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants.

The change means the EPA will focus rules for fine particulate matter and ozone only on the cost to industry, part of a broader realignment under President Donald Trump toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

The agency said in a statement late Monday that it “absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment"" but “will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The EPA will continue to estimate costs to businesses to comply with the rules and will continue “ongoing work to refine its economic methodologies” of pollution rules, spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.

“The EPA’s mandate is to protect public health, not to ignore the science in order to eliminate clean air safeguards that save lives,'' said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He called the change in how public health benefits are calculated “reckless, dangerous, and illegal,'' adding: “By pretending real health benefits do not count, EPA wants to open the door for industry to foul the air, while communities and families pay the price in asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.”

The change in how the EPA calculates health benefits was first reported by The New York Times.

The move is part of the EPA's broader change in approach

The move comes as the Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

In a court filing in November, the EPA said the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

The EPA said it continues to recognize the “clear and well-documented benefits” of reducing fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, and ozone.

“Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact,” Hirsch said in an emailed statement, saying the agency remains committee to human health.

Since the EPA’s creation more than 50 years ago, Republican and Democratic administrations have used different estimates to assign monetary value to a human life in cost-benefit analyses.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated that its proposed rule on PM2.5 would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays by 2032. For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading. By failing to include ranges or other qualifying statements, EPA’s use of specific estimate “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality,” the agency said in an economic impact analysis for the new NOx rule.

“Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

The United States has made substantial progress in reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations since 2000, the agency said.

Critics warn the change poses risks to human health

But critics said a new EPA rule that revises emission limits for dangerous nitrogen oxide pollution from new gas-burning turbines used in power plants demonstrates the risks of the new approach.

Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases. EPA’s final NOx rule, issued Monday, is substantially less restrictive than a proposal under the Biden administration. For some gas plants, the rule weakens protections in place for two decades.

The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act. Critics said the change means EPA will ignore the economic value of lives saved, hospital visits avoided and lost work and school days prevented.

Under Trump, the EPA ""recklessly refuses to place any value on protecting the health of millions of Americans from nitrogen oxides pollution in the face of mountains of medical science finding that this pollution contributes to asthma attacks, heart disease and other serious health problems.” said Noha Haggag, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, another environmental group.

“EPA is leaving millions of people in harm’s way when common sense solutions are at hand for modern national limits on nitrogen oxides pollution,'' Haggag said.

“The Trump EPA is unequivocally committed to following the Clean Air Act, and EPA legally cannot approve Colorado’s SIP revision,” the agency wrote.
“Colorado submitted a highly protective, innovative plan that met all state and federal requirements to reduce regional haze,” Ogletree said.
Either process would require the state to craft a new long-term strategy consistent with Clean Air Act requirements and the agency’s updated regional haze rule.
The decision also arrives as the EPA has formally delayed the next planning phase of the regional haze program.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday rejected Colorado’s latest air-quality plan aimed at improving visibility in the state’s national parks and wilderness areas, saying the measure violated federal law by forcing the closure of coal-fired power plants without the consent of plant operators.

The EPA’s full disapproval of Colorado’s 2022 Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, wrote the agency, was necessary to prevent “the premature closure of power plants” and to uphold the Clean Air Act.

“The Trump administration chose dirtier air and higher costs … and rejected Colorado’s and utilities’ careful plans to save people money and increase energy availability and reliability,” the office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a Tuesday statement to the newspaper. “Keeping old coal plants online will increase costs to ratepayers, worsen air quality, and make it harder to bring lower cost and cleaner generation online.”

The Regional Haze Program , adopted in 1999, requires states to reduce airborne pollutants that impair views at national parks and wilderness areas.

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” wrote EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in the statement. “EPA is ready and willing to work full-heartedly with Colorado to revise its SIP, ensuring full compliance with the Clean Air Act as written.”

The agency said Colorado’s inclusion of non-consensual retirement dates — in particular, the proposed 2028 closure of Colorado Springs Utilities’ Nixon Unit 1 — lacked the legal assurances required under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, noting that the plan failed to show that such retirements would not constitute an unlawful taking of private property.

The EPA also cited concerns regarding the plan’s harmful impacts to “grid reliability,” referencing the Department of Energy’s Dec. 30 emergency order requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 to continue operating until at least March 30, 2026 due to an energy “emergency” in the West.

“The Trump EPA is unequivocally committed to following the Clean Air Act, and EPA legally cannot approve Colorado’s SIP revision,” the agency wrote. “Shutting down these power plants is not necessary to meet regional haze requirements, and including forced closure deadlines for facilities that want to stay open would have been a misuse of the CAA.”

According to the statement, Colorado has two years to submit a “revised, approvable” plan — otherwise the EPA will complete a “federal implementation plan.”

Federal rejection sets off political and policy backlash

Colorado leaders swiftly criticized the move as a setback for both climate goals and consumer savings.

The governor’s office called the decision “out of touch with the realities of the electric grid in Colorado,” arguing that the state’s utilities have already planned — and in many cases begun — to retire aging coal plants based on cost, not politics.

In the case of Craig Station, Tri-State confirmed to the newspaper last month that the plant, as a result of the Department of Energy’s emergency order, “will likely require additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply, all factors increasing costs.”

While the agency’s disapproval does dictate that state coal plant closures are not federally enforceable, the closures are included in state regulation, meaning they remain enforceable through state law.

“President Trump’s so-called ‘energy emergency’ is being used to justify tying the hands of utilities, forcing them to keep aging, outdated power plants open,” said U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet in a statement.

“It’s unacceptable to burden ratepayers with unnecessary costs,” he continued. “Federal intervention like this makes long-term planning impossible — this is not how you operate a business, plan an electric grid, or help a community stay prosperous.”

Bennet accused the White House of using federal energy policy to retaliate against states like Colorado that have adopted more aggressive clean-energy goals, adding that “President Trump continues to take out his personal and political grievances on Coloradans who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in a statement the EPA’s decision undermines progress under the very program it was meant to advance.

“Colorado submitted a highly protective, innovative plan that met all state and federal requirements to reduce regional haze,” Ogletree said.

“EPA’s action is not based on a failure to meet visibility protections, which Colorado continues to meet,” he continued. “The decision reflects a disagreement over our inclusion of coal-fired power plant retirement dates — a provision that signals the state’s commitment to a cleaner energy future and aligns with existing law and market realities.”

“Regardless of EPA’s decision, Colorado will continue to lead,” he added, noting that the state has shown “that it is possible to protect public health, reduce pollution, and maintain a reliable energy system at the same time.”

Ogletree said the department is continuing to review the EPA’s disapproval and is “considering taking next steps.”

Tri-State weighs in

In a Tuesday statement to the newspaper, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which co-owns Craig Station, said it was evaluating the implications of EPA’s decision.

“Tri-State is reviewing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s disapproval of plant closure dates included in Colorado’s revised 2022 Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, particularly as it relates to Craig Generating Station,” wrote Tri-State Public Relations Specialist Mark Stutz.

“Tri-State appreciates the federal government’s focus on grid reliability and rising energy demand in the West, as they remain our members’ top priorities,” he added. “Regardless of market conditions and regulatory landscape, we are committed to meet our members’ needs in the most reliable, affordable and responsible way possible.”

In Northwest Colorado, the ruling could keep coal generation at the Craig Station operating longer than expected.

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

Those plans remain in effect under state law, but will no longer be federally enforceable pending a new plan proposed by the state or federal implementation plan through the EPA.

What happens next

Under federal law, Colorado must now resubmit a revised SIP that meets EPA’s conditions or face a federally imposed implementation plan within two years. Either process would require the state to craft a new long-term strategy consistent with Clean Air Act requirements and the agency’s updated regional haze rule.

The decision also arrives as the EPA has formally delayed the next planning phase of the regional haze program.

The same day the federal Department of Energy ordered Craig Station’s Unit 1 to remain open, Zeldin extended the deadline for states to submit the next round of state plans from 2028 to 2031, citing the need for additional time to align state plans with the agency’s forthcoming regulatory overhaul of the haze program.

The EPA initially proposed a partial approval of the plan in July 2025, citing general alignment with visibility objectives but warning that certain provisions raised legal questions.

After a 60-day public comment period, the agency pivoted to full disapproval following energy supply concerns and the DOE’s emergency directive to keep the Craig unit online.

In the Friday statement, EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western said the final ruling is “fully compliant with the Clean Air Act while simultaneously providing for clean air for all Americans,” emphasizing that the agency “is ready and willing to work full-heartedly with Colorado to revise its SIP, ensuring full compliance with the Clean Air Act as written.”

The disapproval underscores a familiar tension between state ambition and federal authority, and raises new questions about the limits of state-driven climate action under an administration prioritizing fossil fuel use for reliability.

For now, the EPA says its “line of communication” with Colorado is open, and the agency “looks forward to working hand in hand” with the state on a new plan.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2025/12/31105222/Station-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:00:27.918567

The proposed rule would revise a 2023 rule by former President Joe Biden’s administration on Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that gave states and tribes authority to protect waterways in their reviews of projects like pipelines and power plants requiring federal permits. Biden’s rule replaced a rule from President Donald Trump’s first administration that limited the ability of states and tribes to block or force changes in the projects.

Jess Kramer, the EPA assistant administrator for water, told reporters the 2023 revision was “fundamentally flawed and it’s inefficient and ineffective.” Kramer said Biden’s revision led to lengthy certification timelines. The proposed rule, Kramer said, will lead to predictable permitting that would “unleash American energy dominance” and support emerging artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Biden’s rule had been praised by conservationists and environmental justice groups concerned about pollution effects on waterways and communities depending on them.

Kramer said the proposed rule will ensure that section 401 is “not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes.” It would set timelines and standardize approaches that states and tribes use in water quality certifications that are required before the federal government issues project permits, the EPA said.

It was the latest move by Trump’s environmental agency to roll back Biden-era environmental rules while supporting development of energy including fossil fuels. The Biden administration had already narrowed the rule in August 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 to limit the regulatory reach of the EPA on the rule, after many farmers and landowners had slammed the agency for what they called regulatory overreach.

The proposed rule will undergo a 30-day comment period and the EPA hopes to finalize the rule in the spring, Kramer said.

Aquatech further processed lithium produced at Adionics’ facility to validate the conversion and refining to battery-grade lithium carbonate. In additional testing, Aquatech converted the lithium-rich brine to a ≥99.5% lithium carbonate product, meeting key specifications for battery manufacturing.

Following the testing results, the parties will continue to move forward under their joint development agreement to evaluate the construction of a lithium facility in Wendover.

The companies have agreed to complete comprehensive feasibility studies and detailed engineering of a 5,000 metric tonne lithium extraction facility and plan to reach a final investment decision in 2026. They also intend to advance project design and development of the project and negotiate definitive agreements to enable construction and operation of the proposed project.

The lithium processing facility is expected to use some of Intrepid’s existing infrastructure in Wendover, Aquatech’s expertise to design, develop and operate the site and Adionics’ direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology to convert Intrepid’s post-process brine to lithium carbonate.

Adionics acquired the technology from Koch Technology Solutions in September 2025.

“Advancements in direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies have come at the perfect time, as the United States has reprioritized increasing its production of critical minerals,” said Kevin Crutchfield, Intrepid’s CEO. “We believe the existing infrastructure at our Wendover potash operation and the presence of lithium in our post-process brine differentiates this opportunity from other lithium development projects and we’re hopeful our Wendover lithium project will be among the first domestic projects to enter the market.”

“We are excited about this project for many reasons, including the advantage we have by working with Intrepid to be able to access brine from Intrepid’s existing potash production site. Coupled with the naturally high lithium concentration in the resource, we expect our integrated flowsheet will operate at an attractive marginal cost, allowing us to produce domestic lithium at a pace and cost point that can compete with global benchmarks,” added Devesh Sharma, CEO of Aquatech.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/intrepid-potash-utah.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:58:49.330615

The EV tax credit was added in 2022 by the Biden administration.
What happened after the federal EV tax credit went away?","California is gearing up to plug a major hole in the nation’s electric-vehicle landscape. With the federal $7,500 EV tax credit wiped out by President Donald Trump and Congress late last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom is moving to deploy state dollars to keep electric car sales from losing momentum.

On Friday, Jan. 9, Newsom unveiled a $200 million plan to offer a new “on‑the‑hood” rebate—an instant discount at the dealership aimed at softening the blow for California drivers and preserving the state’s status as the country’s EV stronghold. While Newsom didn’t specify how large the rebate will be, he cast the effort as California once again stepping in where Washington won’t.

Here's what to know about the California EV rebate program.

Why is California stepping in to offer EV tax credits?

California has the highest percentage of car buyers who choose electric cars.

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies in Washington for most major automakers, EVs and hybrids accounted for 22.9 percent of new light-duty vehicle registrations in California in the second quarter of 2025, the most recent data the group has made publicly available. Colorado was the only others state above 20 percent market share in the second quarter of 2025.

Carmakers have lamented the loss of the federal incentive for EVs, and several have slashed plans to build future electric models in light of the shift in the federal government's support for the technology.

California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Lauren Sanchez said in an exclusive interview with USA Today that her state is stepping up to offer EV tax credits because ""the rest of the global market is moving toward' Zero Emission Vehicles, despite the backsliding in the level of federal support under Trump.

Sanchez said embracing EVs is ""a point of pride in California"" because ""a third of EV sales are in California.""

Under California's previous EV tax credit program, which ran from 2013-2024, the state spent $1.49 billion to cover credits for 586,000 vehicles, according to CARB.

Do used EVs qualify for tax credits?

Under the old federal tax credit, used EVs qualified for up to $4,000 in tax credits. The EV tax credit was added in 2022 by the Biden administration. Prior to that, only new EVs qualified for any tax credits.

Sanchez said California is still sorting out whether it will be able to offer a used EV tax credit under Newsom's plan.

""The team is taking a hard look at how we can a used incentive work, given how important used EVs are in California,"" she said.

How Californians can get the tax credit rebate

California officials say the program will function as an “on‑the‑hood” discount, meaning buyers receive the rebate instantly at the dealership rather than waiting for tax season. Here’s what to expect based on how similar state programs have operated:

Point‑of‑sale enrollment: Buyers will likely sign a short form at participating dealerships, which will apply the discount directly to the purchase price.

Income and vehicle requirements (pending): CARB says it is still finalizing details, but past programs included income limits and price caps to prioritize middle‑income buyers and affordable EV models.

New vs. used EVs: California hasn’t confirmed whether used EVs will qualify, but officials say they are evaluating options due to the state’s large used‑EV market.

Launch timeline: Newsom’s office has not announced a launch date, but the administration says it aims to offer rebates “soon,” with CARB expected to publish full eligibility rules once finalized.

What happened after the federal EV tax credit went away?

Several of the most popular electric car models experienced steep sales drops in the fourth quarter of 2025, after setting records in the third quarter as car buyers rushed to take advantage of the $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired at the end of September 2025.

Here's how some of the top-selling U.S. EVs fared in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter:

Tesla Model 3 and Model Y | Q3 2025: 481,166 | Q4 2025: 406,585

Ford Mustang Mach-E | Q3 2025: 20,177 | Q4 2025: 9,658

Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Q3 2025: 8,408 | Q4 2025: 2,279

Honda Prologue | Q3 2025: 20,236 | Q4 2025: 2,641

Volkwagen ID.4 | Q3 2025: 4,518 | Q4 2025: 248

What people are saying about California's move to backfill EV tax credits?

Automakers cheered California's move to step in and offer tax credits for EV buyers in the nation's most populous state, saying incentivizing EV sales has worked in the past.

""At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California – and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country,” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement.","https://www.desertsun.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/30/PNAS/87961172007-tesla-charging.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 19:00:13.544237

Unlike Oklo, however, TerraPower has focused almost all of its attention on a single design: its Natrium reactor.
TerraPower, like Oklo, has its share of private partnerships to complement its federal collaborations.
The terms of Meta’s deal with TerraPower are, as of now, less developed than those with Oklo.","Oklo’s existing pipeline: Oklo enters this deal with Meta as it works through a complicated network of partnerships with the Department of Energy along with tentative commitments in the private sector.

In 2025 alone, Oklo announced a number of deals with companies like Vertiv, Liberty, Kiewit, Blykalla, and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power.

As for DOE programs, first, in August, Oklo was selected for the Reactor Pilot Program. The company’s selection was noteworthy, because three of its projects were chosen for the program, whereas other companies have only one project.

Oklo was also selected for the related Fuel Line Pilot Program, which focuses on fuel fabrication facilities rather than new reactor builds. Since then, the company has broken ground on the site of its first Aurora reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (dubbed Aurora-INL), has signed an other transaction agreement with the DOE, and has received approval for its Nuclear Safety Design Agreement for its Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility, also at INL.

New Auroras: Meta’s partnership with Oklo will center on a new facility in Pike County, Ohio. Targeted to come on line as early as 2030, the campus could feature as much as 1.2 GW of new nuclear capacity.

This capacity will come from the deployment of multiple Aurora reactors. Because of the reactor’s complicated history, however, some details are still up in the air. In 2016, Oklo entered into preapplication activities with the NRC for a 1.5-MW version of the Aurora. The eventual license application for that project was denied by the NRC in 2022. Since then, the planned capacity of the reactor has changed several times.

Aurora-INL is rated at 75 MWe. Assuming the Auroras deployed with Meta will mirror the design of Aurora-INL, the Ohio site could be home to as many as 16 reactors.

Oklo coming to Ohio makes good on plans that have been in the making since 2023, when it signed an agreement with the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative to deploy two 15-MWe Auroras on land near the site of the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

More deals for TerraPower: Like Oklo, TerraPower is entering into this new collaboration with Meta boosted by tailwinds of DOE support. Unlike Oklo, however, TerraPower has focused almost all of its attention on a single design: its Natrium reactor.

The first deployment of the Natrium reactor will be in Kemmerer, Wyo., where the company broke ground on nonnuclear construction in June 2024. This project was first selected for fast-tracking under the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program in 2020.

On that front, TerraPower has made persistent progress. Most recently, the NRC completed its final safety evaluation for the project’s construction permit application in December 2025. The company expects to complete the project in 2030. TerraPower is also supported by the DOE’s HALEU Availability Program and was allocated HALEU in 2025.

TerraPower, like Oklo, has its share of private partnerships to complement its federal collaborations. In 2025 alone, the company signed an MOU with the Utah Office of Energy Development to potentially site a Natrium reactor in the state; signed an MOU with engineering company KBR to conduct joint studies on deploying a Natrium reactor in the U.K., building on its broader engagement in the U.K. regulatory process; and signed an MOU with Evergy and the Kansas Department of Commerce to potentially site a Natrium reactor in that state as well.

The terms of Meta’s deal with TerraPower are, as of now, less developed than those with Oklo. The locations of the eight potential reactors that the partnership could involve are currently undecided. TerraPower said in a statement that the companies “will target identification of a specific site for the initial dual reactor unit in the coming months.”

TerraPower is aiming for the first units in this new project to come on line as early as 2032. The terms of the deal state that Meta will support early development activity for the first two new units, and hold rights for energy from up to six additional units.",https://www.ans.org/file/23147/l/OkloTerraPowerLogos.png,N,,2026-01-13 18:13:45.137208

This comprehensive document is a win for Texans and all Americans alike. It is a bold roadmap for House Republicans’ next reconciliation bill that aims to tackle the affordability crisis created by former President Biden’s administration.

The plan lays out a clear, actionable strategy to restore the American Dream of homeownership, reduce health care premiums, cut energy prices, rebuild the American family, and slash wasteful government spending while codifying President Trump's America First agenda that puts American families, not Washington bureaucrats, first.

“Texans are tired of excuses from Washington. They want lower prices, less government, and real results,” said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11). “It’s no secret that families across the nation are paying more for gas, housing, and health care because of failed Biden-era policies. This plan takes a sledgehammer to that unaffordable agenda, cutting waste, unleashing American energy, and making it easier for Texans to own a home, afford high-quality health care, and keep more of their hard-earned paycheck. We have 11 months of guaranteed majorities. We're not wasting a single day.”

For years, hardworking Texans have been stretched thin from skyrocketing prices for groceries, gas, rent, and health care. The RSC's Reconciliation 2.0 framework flips the script.

A Plan Built Around Affordability

The RSC’s Reconciliation 2.0 Framework centers on three pillars rooted in building off the success of the Working Families Tax Cuts to deliver lasting affordability:

· Housing: restoring the American Dream of homeownership by expanding supply, lowering mortgage barriers, eliminating marriage penalties, and stopping policies that crowd Americans out of the housing market.

· Health Care: putting patients back in control, lowering drug prices, increasing transparency, and ensuring taxpayer-funded benefits serve American citizens—not bureaucrats or special interests.

· Energy: unleashing American energy dominance by cutting red tape, accelerating permitting, and driving down energy bills and prices at the pump.

The framework also achieves over$1 trillion in net deficit reduction, and permanently codifies more of President Trump’s historic executive actions so future administrations cannot reverse them.

""this is a politically framed announcement about weakening how states and tribes can block federally permitted projects using water quality rules, dressed up as “streamlining” and “efficiency.”

Here is what it actually means in plain English.

What is Clean Water Act Section 401?

Section 401 gives states and authorized tribes the power to say yes, no, or yes-with-conditions to federally permitted projects that could affect their waters.

Examples: pipelines, dams, power plants, transmission lines.

They can block or condition a project if it would violate state or tribal water quality standards.

This is one of the strongest tools states and tribes have to protect local water.

What changed in 2023?

The Biden EPA rule:

Let states and tribes look broadly at water impacts

Allowed more time and back-and-forth to fully review projects

Let them deny projects not just for narrow pollution issues, but for wider water quality harms

Industry and Republican lawmakers said this gave states too much power to slow or stop projects they didn’t like.

What is the Trump EPA proposing now?

The proposed rule would:

Narrow what states and tribes are allowed to consider

Force faster decisions, even for complex projects

Limit denials only to very specific, narrowly defined water quality issues

Prevent states and tribes from using Section 401 to block projects for climate, land use, treaty rights, or cumulative impacts

In practice, it makes it much harder for states or tribes to say no.

What does “streamline permitting” really mean here?

Translated:

Fewer reasons states/tribes can deny a project

Less time to review

Less leverage to demand changes

More projects automatically move forward

This primarily benefits:

Energy projects (pipelines, LNG, coal, transmission)

Large infrastructure developers

What does “eliminating regulatory overreach” mean?

This is political language, not a neutral legal term.

It means:

“We think states and tribes were using their authority too aggressively”

“We want to reduce their power”

Why does this matter?

Because it:

Shifts power from states and tribes to federal agencies and developers

Weakens tribal sovereignty in water protection decisions

Increases the likelihood that projects get approved even over local objections

Makes environmental review faster but shallower

Supporters call this economic growth.

Critics call it rolling back environmental and tribal protections.

All wildlife species - particularly migratory waterfowl - that journey across multiple states know no geo-political or economic boundaries. Waterways within states or tribal territories - potholes and vernal pools, e.g. - serve as essential stopover sites for migrating wildlife to nourish and rest during their journeys across the states.

Furthermore, while some waterways whose surface area is within state or tribal boundaries, their aquifers and water tables often cross state and tribal boundaries.

It is a fool's errand, therefore, to allow water quality in such waterways to be compromised - also at the risk of human health and lives - by the acts of greedy industrial corporations and their billionaire executives who seek economic self-enrichment at the expense of the very natural resources upon which even their own lives depend.

If this is what's called ""making America great,"" then someone has an awfully warped sense of what ""great"" is.

Yes, I did.

And you've also held a number of positions in this term, including Chief of Staff to Energy Secretary Wright, correct?

I did, yes.

Great. I'm hoping that you could help me understand more about the agency's decision making process.

You know, we've talked about how there have been many clean energy projects that have been canceled over the last year. In fact, since January of last year, over 170,000 energy jobs across the country on clean energy projects have been lost or impacted due to the policy changes from your department.

One company canceled plans for a battery manufacturing facility in Buckeye, Arizona that cost 6,400 jobs to the local community. Glendale, Kentucky, has lost over 150,000 jobs due to another manufacturing facility closure.

As Chief of Staff to Secretary Wright and as acting Undersecretary, were there assessments done on how many jobs would be lost due to these decisions?

Well, my understanding is that when an applicant submits an application, there is a comprehensive assessment because we need to understand what the jobs-

I’m not speaking to applications. I'm talking about, you know, policy changes around tax credits, around other sorts of I mean, it can include applications as well, but did you do an assessment on how many American jobs would be lost prior to you making your policy conclusions?

I think we're always continuously assessing-

I think it's pretty simple. Did you do the assessments? Did you do the assessment on how many jobs would be lost before making a choice, or did you not do the assessment?

We review the applications as they come in, and part of that can be the jobs-

That sounds like a no to me, Undersecretary, that 170,000 Americans have lost their job due to the policy changes implemented by you and your department, and you didn't even think about it.

There was no assessment. 170,000 Americans out of a job, out of health insurance, out of any opportunity- battery manufacturing plants in Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky.

And you are telling me that there was not an assessment done on how many Americans were going to lose their job before you made your decisions and before this administration made decisions on revoking tax credits, manufacturing credits that were going to affect these facilities, that is what I'm being told today. Is that correct?

No. As I mentioned, we have a comprehensive review process for all applications-

And does that process include how many jobs would be lost?

Job numbers are typically-

That sounds like a no to me. That sounds like a no to me, Undersecretary Fitzsimmons.

Now I want to move forward. In Newnan, Georgia, a company planning a battery manufacturing facility walked back a $2.6 billion investment in the state of Georgia.

The company cited the clean energy tax credits that were critical to its decision to invest in the project, and the Trump administration's reversal and decimation of these tax credits ended a $2.6 billion energy investment in the state of Georgia alone. You must be aware that under President Trump, the United States, in just a year, has lost $53 billion in clean energy investment in our infrastructure.

So what I am trying to understand, since you have described yourself as “spearheading” the Department of Energy's dominance agenda, is why- and under President Trump's energy dominance executive order, it talks about good paying jobs. So how is this administration, and how are you, assessing these projects when we have resulted in a net loss of 170,000 jobs?

As I mentioned, we have a comprehensive review process. President Trump is focused on restoring American energy dominance after years, four years, of disastrous energy subtraction policies. And so we're investing in an affordable, reliable and secure-

So we’re doing that by cutting American jobs, and then trying to invade Venezuela to compensate?

Thank you. I yield back.”

The following is a reaction from Jon Devine, senior attorney and director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council): “The Clean Water Act empowers states and Tribes to stop or fix projects that would foul their waters.
Instead of sidelining experts, the Agency should abandon its latest attack on our waterways, follow the Clean Water Act, and let communities keep their rivers, lakes, and drinking water supplies safe.” Background: What does the proposal do?
This proposed rule would dramatically curtail state and Tribal authority under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
Certifying authorities can certify the project as proposed, impose conditions on the federal permit, deny certification, or waive it.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed rule today to restrict the authority of states and Tribes to ensure that federally permitted projects such as oil and gas pipelines and hydropower dams do not undermine water quality. The proposal would make it harder for states and Tribes to deny or modify projects that pollute or degrade rivers, wetlands, and drinking water sources.

The following is a reaction from Jon Devine, senior attorney and director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“The Clean Water Act empowers states and Tribes to stop or fix projects that would foul their waters. EPA's proposal would weaken the law to fast-track pipelines and other polluting projects, leaving it to people downstream to pay the price without input in the process. Instead of sidelining experts, the Agency should abandon its latest attack on our waterways, follow the Clean Water Act, and let communities keep their rivers, lakes, and drinking water supplies safe.”

Background:

What does the proposal do? This proposed rule would dramatically curtail state and Tribal authority under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

What Section 401 does: Before a federal license or permit is issued for a project that may discharge into protected waters, the project developer must obtain “certification” from the relevant state or authorized Tribe that the project will comply with water quality requirements. Certifying authorities can certify the project as proposed, impose conditions on the federal permit, deny certification, or waive it.

Practical effect: Among other things, the proposal would greatly limit the authority of states and Tribes to look at the whole proposed project and force them to ignore project‑related pollution risks that threaten downstream communities and ecosystems.

By September 2024, 15,000 young people had joined the American Climate Corps, according to the administration, working to restore landscapes and install solar panels around the country.
American Climate Corps jobs were in blue states and red states, in rural areas and cities, according to research published in November.
“You can cancel the Climate Corps, but … a lot of what communities need right now has to do with responding to and preparing for climate change-exacerbated extreme events,” Fisher said.
“In that, we are also building a broader coalition and showing that the Climate Corps Network is not maybe what everyone thinks it is,” Glazewski said.","Two long years ago, it appeared that the much-anticipated American Climate Corps was finally happening. President Joe Biden had promised to build a green jobs workforce inspired by the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s most popular New Deal programs, ever since he was on the campaign trail. By September 2024, 15,000 young people had joined the American Climate Corps, according to the administration, working to restore landscapes and install solar panels around the country.

It didn’t even last a year. The Biden administration wound down the program last January ahead of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, correctly anticipating that Trump would take a hammer to anything with “climate” in the name.

But even as climate change fell off the national agenda and the promise of federal funding vanished, some states have found ways to continue to support Climate Corps-style work over the past year. Their efforts show what’s still politically viable — and under what conditions these initiatives can still succeed — assuming local governments and nonprofits find the funds.

One of the survivors is, unsurprisingly, California, a state with many climate-friendly initiatives that have enough resources to survive a federal drought. “We’ve stayed the course and are moving forward full steam ahead, and our climate work hasn’t been impacted by the chaos at the federal level,” said Josh Fryday, who runs GO-Serve, Governor Gavin Newsom’s newly created office for service and civic engagement.

The “chaos” Fryday was referring to? Last spring, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency abruptly pulled 32,000 AmeriCorps members from their jobs tutoring children in low-income areas, working at food banks, and helping towns recover from weather disasters. It also put 85 percent of the federal service agency’s 500 staffers on leave. Though a court case eventually restored the $400 million in grant funding, much of the damage had already been done: Many programs had been disrupted, if not completely terminated, including some climate and conservation crews.

Thanks to its state funding, Fryday’s California Climate Action Corps was safe. The program now has roughly 400 members spread across the state working to make homes more fire-proof, divert food from landfills, and organize climate action days for the public. “Our hope is that over time, it continues to grow as there’s need and demand,” Fryday said.

Environmental service work has staying power in the state, with the 50-year-old California Conservation Corps still running strong with more than 1,500 members. But even with the state government’s support, other programs — environmental and otherwise — weren’t immune. After the cuts in April, AmeriCorps members helping residents of Los Angeles recover from the fires that had swept through the city were placed on leave, with many unable to finish their terms as they found other work or funding ran out.

It’s a story that played out across the country. Some service programs folded, while others steered clear of using the word “climate” to describe their work; many limped on despite uncertain funding. American Climate Corps jobs were in blue states and red states, in rural areas and cities, according to research published in November. “It speaks to the fact that this kind of work is needed everywhere,” said Dana Fisher, a professor at American University’s School of International Service whose team mapped the locations of Climate Corps positions.

“You can cancel the Climate Corps, but … a lot of what communities need right now has to do with responding to and preparing for climate change-exacerbated extreme events,” Fisher said.

These days, climate service work may be most likely to continue in response to very specific needs. In western North Carolina, AmeriCorps members are still helping with the recovery from Hurricane Helene, clearing storm debris and restoring access to trails and public lands, said Briles Johnson, the executive director of VolunteerNC, which oversees service programs in the state.

There may even be room for growth when local demands arise. In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, recently created a task force to deal with an outbreak of the mountain pine beetle that’s killing the state’s ponderosa pines. Warming temperatures and drought allowed the beetle populations to take off, and all the dead trees they leave behind increase the risk of wildfires. Conservation crews with Serve Colorado are supposed to help address the outbreak, backed by proposed state funding, according to a spokesperson for the state’s climate corps service work.

State-specific funding seems to be the safest way forward, but it can be hard to scrape together the money for it. One model comes from Washington state, which is fueling its new Climate Corps Network with profits from the state’s “cap-and-invest” program that requires polluters to lower their carbon emissions or to buy permits for them at auctions. The Washington Climate Corps Network announced almost $1.5 million in grants in 2025 to 11 different projects across the state, including restoring degraded estuaries to help them sequester carbon and helping communities prepare for extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

Matt Glazewski, director of the Washington Climate Corps Network, described it as a “small program, but with lofty goals” to develop a climate workforce and introduce people of all ages to potential climate-friendly careers.

While the American Climate Corps quickly became bogged down in a partisan fight after Biden proposed billions of dollars for it, Glazewski has found that it’s possible to get Republicans on board with his state’s program. Some grants are flowing to rural parts of Washington where terms like “climate action” may not resonate. “I’m not out there waving that flag in a way that people would expect it to look like,” Glazewski said. A $200,000 grant from the program is going to the Port of Pend Oreille in the northeast corner of Washington along the Idaho border, where workers are converting diesel locomotives to run on cleaner engines.

“You have a community here that is deeply conservative, that is keen on doing this because they know that it makes sense,” Glazewski said. “They know they have a business model — and once they have the opportunity to actually install the infrastructure, are invested in doing that.” He said that a few Republican members of the state legislature support the Washington Climate Corps Network, including state Senator Shelley Short, who represents Pend Oreille County.

“In that, we are also building a broader coalition and showing that the Climate Corps Network is not maybe what everyone thinks it is,” Glazewski said. “We can show them it can be just about anything — if it’s meaningful in your community, it’s mobilizing people to gain exposure to a job that is more climate-friendly and part of this new green or blue economy, that it can be for you.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/California-Conservation-Corps-firefighters.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-13 16:59:53.799297

Public Land Order 7917 banned mining across the Duluth Complex with no congressional input and no proper notification to Congress as required by law.
“Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply.
The Congressional Review Act offers a way to break that pattern.
“Congress can restore access to vital resources, provide the certainty needed for investment, and establish that major decisions about public lands require congressional accountability.","For the first time in history, a Public Land Order is being submitted to Congress for review. That seemingly technical milestone could reshape how the federal government manages hundreds of millions of acres of public land—and it starts with a mining ban in Minnesota.

In January 2023, the Biden administration locked away 225,504 acres of Minnesota’s Superior National Forest, home to the world’s largest untapped copper-nickel deposit. Public Land Order 7917 banned mining across the Duluth Complex with no congressional input and no proper notification to Congress as required by law. After the Trump administration transmitted the order to Congress on January 8, 2026, Rep. Pete Stauber announced plans to use a powerful tool for congressional oversight—the Congressional Review Act—to overturn the ban.

If successful, this effort would restore access to critical minerals in Northern Minnesota and establish precedent that Public Land Orders are subject to congressional oversight—fundamentally changing how future administrations can restrict resource development on federal lands.

Breaking new ground

Pacific Legal Foundation has long advocated that Public Land Orders constitute “rules” under the Congressional Review Act and must be submitted to Congress for review, but no previous administration has taken this important step. By transmitting PLO 7917, the Trump administration has opened the door for Congress to exercise oversight authority that should have existed all along.

“This constitutes a positive, major shift in policy and a potential breakthrough for miners, rural communities, and anyone affected by the regulatory ‘ping-pong’ on federal lands,” said Joe Luppino-Esposito, PLF’s Federal Policy director. “Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply. When executive actions can shut down lawful exploration overnight, it weakens investment, domestic production, and our ability to secure critical resources at home.”

That regulatory uncertainty has real costs. The Duluth Complex could supply critical minerals for generations, powering American technology and strengthening national security. Yet the Biden administration’s ban meant companies couldn’t plan, investors couldn’t commit, and communities couldn’t build around resources beneath their feet. One administration opens the door to development; the next slams it shut.

The Congressional Review Act offers a way to break that pattern. Congress can overturn agency rules with a majority vote in both chambers. If the president signs a resolution of disapproval, the rule is nullified and the agency cannot issue a substantially similar rule without new congressional authorization. That means once Congress overturns a Public Land Order, similar restrictions can be imposed only through legislation—not executive fiat.

A precedent that matters

The resolution targets one specific mining ban, but its implications extend far beyond Minnesota. Establishing that Public Land Orders are subject to CRA review means Congress can evaluate any executive land withdrawal, past or future.

“This isn’t just about overturning one land withdrawal,” said Paige Gilliard, an attorney in PLF’s Environment and Natural Resources legal practice. “It’s about establishing that the executive branch must follow proper procedures when making decisions that affect resource development and the livelihoods of American communities. This resolution can unlock the abundance that public lands provide while ensuring these decisions are made through the democratic process, not executive overreach.”

Rep. Stauber, who represents Northern Minnesota and is leading the CRA effort, understands what’s at stake for his constituents and the nation. Congress recently used the CRA to overturn the Biden EPA’s California emissions waiver—one of the highest-profile applications of the law in years. These back-to-back efforts signal renewed congressional appetite to reclaim authority over regulatory policy.

Congress should act quickly. The 60-session-day window for expedited CRA procedures means time is limited.

“The opportunity is historic,” Luppino-Esposito said. “Congress can restore access to vital resources, provide the certainty needed for investment, and establish that major decisions about public lands require congressional accountability. The precedent set here will protect resource access for generations—not just in Minnesota, but across the country.”",https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/congressional-review-act-plo-minn.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 16:59:59.010072

In light of this focus and recent DOJ activity, board members and in-house legal and compliance professionals should pay particular attention to the shipment of goods to and from East Asia, certifications made in connection with government contracts or grant or loan programs, and operations in Latin America. For energy and technology companies, we expect three areas to be of particular relevance to compliance efforts:

I. Continued Use of the False Claims Act for Administration Priorities

The DOJ made broad use of the civil False Claims Act (FCA) in 2025 and will continue to do so in 2026. The FCA imposes civil liability for obtaining money from, or avoiding payments to, the federal government through the making of false statements or certifications. The civil FCA does not provide for jail time, but the monetary penalties can be quite high because the government is allowed to collect treble damages for each false claim. FCA cases can be brought either by the DOJ directly or by a private citizen, known as a “qui tam relator,” who stands in the shoes of the government, unless and until the government decides to intervene in the case.

While, historically, the majority of FCA cases have involved alleged health-care fraud, the DOJ under the Trump administration has used the statute broadly to target administration priorities like customs and trade enforcement; immigration; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); and cybersecurity.

Customs and Trade-Related Enforcement. On December 18, for example, DOJ announced that Ceratizit USA, a North Carolina–based distributor of tungsten carbide products, had agreed to pay $54.4 million to resolve customs and trade-related FCA allegations, originally brought in a qui tam lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan.1 The settlement was reportedly the largest ever settlement of a custom-duties evasion case.

While the monetary amount of the settlement may have been unprecedented, the factual theories of liability have become fairly common in customs-related FCA cases. Specifically, Ceratzit allegedly (i) misrepresented the country of origin on goods imported into the U.S. (declaring goods as originating in Taiwan instead of China); (ii) transshipped Chinese manufactured goods through Taiwan to conceal their true origin; (iii) misclassified products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to reduce duties owed; and (iv) failed to properly mark goods with country of origin information. We expect to see more of such cases and investigations in 2026.

Immigration. DOJ used the False Claims Act in the immigration context as well. On September 9, the Department announced a settlement with a New Jersey-based company, Bayonne Drydock, that worked on U.S. Navy ships, for “its continued employment of unauthorized alien employees in violation of the Employment Eligibility clause (‘E-Verify’) of the Federal Acquisition regulations.”2 As part of the resolution, the Company agreed to pay a four million dollar fine.

Anti-DEI initiatives. Previously, in May 2025, DOJ announced the start of the “Civil Rights Fraud Initiative,” which DOJ said, will “utilize the False Claims Act to investigate and, as appropriate, pursue claims against any recipient of federal funds that knowingly violates federal civil rights laws.”3 The Department’s press release announcing the initiative also “strongly encourage[d] anyone with knowledge of discrimination by federal funding recipients to consider filing a qui tam action under the False Claims Act.”

On December 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration has launched civil FCA investigations into DEI programs at major U.S. companies.4 The article reported that DOJ’s theory in these investigations is that companies holding federal contracts may be violating the FCA if they continue to consider diversity factors in hiring or promotion. Presumably, the relevant contracts require the company to make some kind of certification that it is in compliance with federal civil rights law, and DOJ’s FCA theory would be that the certification is false if the company is engaging in certain DEI practices. We expect to see these and similar investigations continue in 2026 and potentially beyond.

Cyber. DOJ also continued to use the FCA as a means to enforce cybersecurity requirements for federal contractors. On July 31, DOJ announced that Illumina Inc. agreed to pay $9.8 million to resolve alleged violations of the FCA related to cybersecurity deficiencies in genomic sequencing systems sold to federal agencies.5 The government alleged the company sold genomic sequencing systems to government customers without an adequate cybersecurity program in place, including by failing to incorporate product cybersecurity into software design, development, installation, and post-market monitoring; failing to timely correct known software vulnerabilities in its products; and misrepresenting compliance with recognized cybersecurity standards, including those issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Potential Headwinds. A significant potential headwind for FCA activity is that, despite being enacted over 100 years ago, the qui tam provision, which allows a private plaintiff to bring an FCA case on behalf of the government, has come under recent judicial scrutiny. In October 2024, in Zafirov v. Florida Medical Associates, LLC, a federal district court in the Middle District of Florida held that the qui tam provision was unconstitutional because it violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. That decision was appealed to the 11th Circuit, and oral argument was held in December 2025. A decision should issue some time in 2026. In 2026, the Third Circuit will also hear oral argument in another FCA case involving a challenge to the qui tam provision, United States ex rel. Penelow v. Janssen Products, L.P..

However, even if these cases hold the qui tam provision unconstitutional, the Department of Justice would still have the ability to launch FCA investigations and bring FCA cases, albeit without the (often significant) help of the plaintiffs’ bar.

II. More Criminal Investigations of Trade and Export Control Practices and Prosecutions Relating to Sensitive Technology

DOJ also continued to bring criminal actions alleging the illegal export of sensitive technology to other countries, in particular China. For example, on November 19, 2025, DOJ announced it had charged four individuals with conspiring to export advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) with artificial intelligence applications to China.6 As alleged, the defendants agreed to purchase the GPUs, which were subject to Commerce Department licensing requirements; transshipped them through Malaysia and Thailand to conceal their ultimate destination in China; and falsified export paperwork to create sham contracts and fake end-users and destinations.

Similarly, in August, DOJ announced that two individuals had been charged in the Central District of California with exporting GPUs to China.7 In that case, the government alleged defendants routed shipments through Singapore and Malaysia to conceal their ultimate destination and received payments from entities based in China and Hong Kong, rather than the listed recipients.

III. The FCPA Lives On

In early 2025, DOJ announced that it was “pausing” enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and in June 2025, announced a new FCPA policy, in which the DOJ would prioritize investigations involving alleged misconduct (i) tied to drug cartels or other transnational criminal organizations; (ii) that deprived U.S. entities of fair access to compete and/or resulted in economic injury to Americans; or (iii) involved critical infrastructure or other assets tied to national security.8

Following the publication of the new policy, the number of FCPA actions remained below historic levels. However, the actions DOJ did announce emphasized these new priorities on bribery that injured U.S. businesses, impacted critical infrastructure, and/or occurred in Latin America.

For example, in August 2025, DOJ filed FCPA bribery charges in the Southern District of Texas against two businessmen, who were alleged to have bribed Mexican officials to obtain business from a Mexican state-owned enterprise and one of its subsidiaries.9 While one of the businessmen remained a fugitive, the other proceeded quickly to trial and was convicted by a jury in Houston federal court in December 2025.

In November, the Department also announced that Comunicaciones Celulares S.A., doing business as TIGO Guatemala, agreed to pay over $118 million as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to resolve an FCPA investigation.10 DOJ alleged that, between 2012 and 2018, company officials had made bribe payments to Guatemalan congressmen in exchange for legislative and political support benefiting TIGO Guatemala and used laundered narcotics proceeds to fund some bribe payments.

Interestingly, in explaining its rationale for deferring prosecution, DOJ credited TIGO Guatemala’s parent corporation’s “voluntary and timely self disclosure” to DOJ of the bribery in 2015 but noted that TIGO Guatemala’s then controlling Guatemalan shareholder used operational control to block access to information, limit cooperation, and impede remediation during the early phase of the investigation.

IV. Takeaways

Companies should expect sustained DOJ scrutiny of both inbound and outbound China related trade activity, including third country transshipment schemes. As noted above, in the second half of 2025, DOJ targeted efforts to use third countries—including Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore—to disguise the shipment of goods both into and out of China. Energy and technology companies with global supply chains should pay appropriate attention to country of origin determinations, routing practices, and distributor oversight with particular care where China is (or may be) the ultimate source or destination. They should maximize visibility into their supply chains, self-audit on a regular basis to verify the information they submit to the U.S. government about their supply chains and, where appropriate, seek independent, third-party verification.

Customs and trade enforcement under the False Claims Act is likely to accelerate notwithstanding constitutional challenges to qui tam actions. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, DOJ’s own enforcement authority will remain intact. The $54.4 million Ceratizit customs related settlement is likely to further incentivize the plaintiffs’ bar to pursue FCA cases, particularly those involving alleged duty evasion, misclassification, undervaluation, and transshipment of China origin goods.

DOJ is using the FCA to advance broader policy priorities, including immigration, anti-DEI, and cybersecurity compliance for government contractors. The White House’s January 8, 2026 announcement that DOJ would be creating a “new division for national fraud enforcement,” to “enforce the Federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting Federal government programs, Federally funded benefits, businesses, nonprofits, and private citizens nationwide,” emphasizes the scrutiny that is being placed on the alleged fraudulent receipt of government funds.11 Energy and technology companies doing business with the federal government should ensure that certifications and policies remain aligned with on-the-ground operational practices.

FCPA enforcement remains selective but real, with Latin America continuing to present elevated risk. In addition, DOJ’s emphasis on the FCPA as a means of promoting fair competition for U.S. companies may provide U.S. companies will an additional avenue of potential recourse if they believe they have been shut out of a foreign government contract because of bribery by a competitor.

Companies should review, and if necessary, strengthen their internal reporting and escalation mechanisms. In particular, compliance programs should ensure that employees have a clear, accessible, and credible path to raise concerns internally, and that reports involving trade controls, China related routing, and third party conduct are promptly investigated and remediated.

Events in Venezuela will continue to play out. DOJ’s recent focus on trade-related investigations and prosecutions and the revised FCPA policy suggest DOJ will, separate and apart from the actual prosecution of Nicolas Maduro, have an important role to play in shaping and implementing U.S. policy in that country.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:12:38.701716

Like other data center projects across the state, Engineered Land’s proposal for 1,845 acres stirred critics.
The Stokes County project would initially draw from generators before connecting to Duke Energy’s grid.
Stokes County has about 45,000 residents, many of whom work in nearby Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Mount Airy.","Stokes County commissioners approved a request for the rezoning of nearly 1,850 acres along the Dan River at the Virginia border for a data center, despite residents’ concerns about noise and other threats to the environment and quality of life.

The 3-2 vote Monday rebuffed an earlier recommendation by the county planning board to deny the rezoning request by the property’s owner, High Point developer David Couch. Instead, commissioners sided with Planning Director Eric Nance, who recommended approval of the rezoning as consistent with economic development goals in the county’s 2035 land-use plan.

Drew Nations, CEO of the project’s developer, Engineered Land Solutions, estimated the county would collect $40 million in annual property taxes from the project. The land’s current tax bill is less than $8,000 a year, he said.

“This county desperately needs the revenue that this data center could produce,’’ commissioner Rick Morris said during a meeting overflowing with opponents. In response to weeks of criticism, Nations said the Charlotte-based developer doesn’t plan to encroach on the Dan River floodplain.

“We are not developing the Dan River,’’ he said. Noting that more than 100 data centers are operating in the state, he added, “Our lives go on just fine.’’

The commissioners also approved an amendment to the county’s zoning ordinance to add data centers as a permitted use and “prepare Stokes County for future land use,’’ according to a meeting notice.

Like other data center projects across the state, Engineered Land’s proposal for 1,845 acres stirred critics. On Monday evening, whistling by opponents could be heard from outside the commission chambers.

“How pleasant would this meeting be with a vacuum cleaner running day and night?’’ resident Kenny Smith said. Others said they were upset about the potential disturbance of historic Indian land.

The proposed rezoning from residential/agricultural to heavy manufacturing with conditions has mobilized opponents rallied by nonprofit Clean Water for North Carolina.

Nations said the rezoning protects the property from development other than data centers. “This is narrowly confined to data centers only,’’ he told the commission. “There are no surprises down the road.’’

Spanning numerous buildings, data centers rely upon large amounts of water for cooling and the heavy usage of electricity for servers and other equipment.

The Stokes County project would initially draw from generators before connecting to Duke Energy’s grid. The Charlotte-based utility’s Belews Creek Steam Station is located near the data center site, which is attractive to Engineered Land due to the availability of utility infrastructure.

Engineered Land Solutions works with Fortune 500 companies to develop projects. Nations is a UNC Chapel Hill graduate who previously worked for Panattoni Development, an Irvine, California-based developer with 69 offices in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8056x4530+0+55/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2Ff9%2F1375e510444db616b743134fe8af%2Fap26012662836755.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:08.621959

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development.
I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects.
At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development.
State Rep. Alex Burton (D-Evansville) represents House District 77 and is a voice for solutions and intentional policies that are fair and forward thinking.","As we head into session, my focus is on advancing responsible, forward-thinking and strategic legislation that puts Hoosiers first. Indiana must strike the right balance between economic development, revenue growth, transparency and the long-term needs of our communities. Our state’s economic interests are not one-size-fits-all. Every region has its own priorities, challenges and vision for the future, and state policy should reflect that reality.

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development. Whether Hoosiers support or oppose these projects, it is clear that the Legislature must lead. Without clear guidance from the state, local governments are being forced to make complex decisions on their own. That has resulted in inconsistent processes, confusion and growing concerns from residents who want answers about water use, energy demands and long-term impacts on their communities.

I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects. That framework must guarantee safe, drinkable water, protect local water supplies and ensure that increased energy demand does not raise monthly utility bills for residential customers. Data centers can use millions of gallons of water and consume as much electricity as small cities, which makes thoughtful oversight essential.

At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development. Oversight is limited to broad environmental laws and permitting processes that were never designed to address the scale of water use and energy demand these facilities create. As a result, states across the country are stepping in to fill the gap. California and Connecticut now require disclosure of water and energy use before projects move forward. Minnesota and Arizona have tightened water permitting for large industrial users, particularly in regions facing supply constraints. Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards. Indiana should learn from these efforts and lead with a clear, consistent approach rather than leaving communities to navigate uncertainty on their own.

Hoosiers are paying attention and want their voices heard. That is why transparency must be a cornerstone of this effort. I strongly believe that requiring public hearings once plans are ready to be shared gives communities a seat at the table and ensures concerns are heard and addressed.

Handled correctly, this approach can strengthen Indiana’s economy, protect our resources and position our state as a national leader. We cannot afford to think short term. This is our moment to act responsibly and put Hoosiers first.

Facing a hostile federal landscape, the Governor continues to champion her all-of-the-above approach to energy that prioritizes affordability, reliability, and sustainability. Governor Hochul will seek safeguards for ratepayers by pushing strict accountability measures on utility companies to protect consumers while advancing aggressive measures to increase clean energy supply.

“As we grapple with frequent attacks from the federal government on energy progress and prices, I remain laser-focused on energy affordability and reliability in New York State,” Governor Hochul said. “We will continue to protect our most vulnerable by making investments in energy affordability programs like Empower+ while holding utility companies accountable to protect consumers from unfair practices. My commitment to an all-of-the-above approach will ensure we keep the lights on and prices down.”

Protecting Against Utility Bill Increases

New Yorkers deserve reliable energy at a price they can afford. Governor Hochul is proposing a sweeping set of reforms, the NYS Affordable Utilities Omnibus Legislation, to modernize the Public Service Law, demanding strict fiscal discipline from utilities and empowering the State to fight more effectively for lower bills.

Tying executive pay to affordability: The Governor is putting ratepayers first. Utilities will be required to publicly disclose how CEO salaries compare to the average worker’s pay and executive compensation will be tied directly to customer affordability. CEOs shouldn't be reaping outsized benefits while ratepayers are struggling to make ends meet.

Eliminating gold-plated rate cases: When requesting rate increases, utilities will be required to present a budget constrained option that keeps their operating and capital costs below the rate of inflation. This exercise will require utilities to prioritize efficiency and affordability and prove why any spending is truly necessary before asking customers to foot the bill.

Removing hidden fees: Ratepayers should only pay for energy services. Period. The Governor is directing the Department of Public Service to review utility bills to ensure customers never foot the bill for inappropriate utility spending, including corporate advertising, fines, and certain legal fees.

Mitigating Energy Cost Burden

Governor Hochul will introduce legislation that will require utilities to create and report on an affordability index, accurately showing the energy burden on customers throughout their service territory. She will also require the Department of Public Service to report on utility affordability by utility, benchmark against data from other states, and make an annual affordability presentation to the Public Service Commission (PSC).

If the PSC finds that any utility in New York is failing to protect energy affordability, this new legislation will empower the Commission to install an independent “Affordability Monitor” inside the utility to address the issue. The Affordability Monitor will have full access to management meetings, books, and records to review utility operations and expenditures to ensure efficient spending and report opportunities for cost savings to PSC.

Modernizing Utility Regulation to Protect Consumers

Rising utility bills are placing real pressure on household budgets. The current process of utility rate setting is increasingly complex, compressed, and difficult for the public to understand or meaningfully engage with in an impactful way. Governor Hochul will advance reforms to modernize how these rate cases are reviewed and resolved, giving regulators more time and flexibility to evaluate utility proposals to ensure they protect consumers, encourage good-faith negotiations, and reduce the frequency of disruptive rate increases. By improving how rate cases are conducted, New York will protect consumers, promote fair outcomes, and put affordability at the center of utility oversight.

Excelsior Power: Advancing a More Flexible and Affordable Grid

As energy demand grows, New York’s electric grid must become more flexible to control costs and maintain reliability, without overbuilding expensive infrastructure. New technologies such as smart thermostats allow utilities to strategically deploy or conserve energy when the grid needs it the most, effectively maintaining comfort and returning benefits such as lower energy bills. Governor Hochul will advance Excelsior Power, a new statewide initiative to make better use of such technologies to increase grid flexibility by shifting when and how electricity is used across the system. Excelsior Power will direct utilities to treat grid flexibility as a core system resource and expand consumer-facing incentive programs that encourage households and businesses to participate in energy flexibility programs.

By harnessing grid flexibility tools such as demand response and smart technologies, the State can avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in system costs each year while reducing the need for costly upgrades and backup power plants – averting costs that will otherwise be shouldered by rate payers. As these programs scale statewide, grid flexibility is expected to deliver billions of dollars in long-term savings, reducing utility bills and strengthening reliability for households and businesses across the State.

Revitalizing EmPower+ to Upgrade New York’s Homes

New York is home to the nation’s oldest building stock. As a result, the cost of upgrading a home to 21st-century energy efficiency and sustainability standards, which ultimately save consumers money, can be prohibitively expensive

Since its launch in 2023, Governor Hochul’s EmPower+ program has helped nearly 42,000 low- and moderate-income households across the state finance energy improvements, saving families about $600 per year on their utility bills, slashing emissions, and making homes more comfortable for families. In 2026, Governor Hochul will invest an additional $50 million into the EmPower+ program, making sure an estimated 10,000 additional households are able to access the free assessments, low-cost direct installs, and targeted upgrades that keep homes comfortable and safe—all while generating jobs and opportunities for local contractors.

Increasing Uptake of Energy Assistance Programs

New York State invests more than $1 billion annually on programs to help families lower their energy bills, such as the Energy Affordability Program (EAP), EmPower+, and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). These programs reduce costs through cash assistance, monthly discounts, and weatherization and efficiency upgrades that reduce energy usage and costs. Despite these benefits, these programs are not being fully utilized by qualifying ratepayers. As a result, it is estimated that only half of income-eligible households utilize the EAP. Further, the delivery of bill financial assistance and weatherization programs can be better aligned to help reduce energy usage and associated bills for those households with the greatest energy burden.

To make sure these critical programs are implemented in a complementary manner and to increase awareness and access for vulnerable New Yorkers, the Governor will streamline planning and administration of these programs to increase the impact of public funds targeting energy burden reductions and make these programs simpler to access. She will also improve utilization by launching a centralized outreach campaign to reach as many New Yorkers as possible.

Establishing a Nuclear Reliability Backbone for a Zero-Emission Grid

As New York transitions to a zero-emission electric grid, the State must ensure reliable and cost-effective baseload power to keep homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure running at all hours. Governor Hochul will ensure that New York State leads in the race to harness safe and reliable advanced nuclear energy to power homes and businesses with zero-emissions electricity for generations to come.

To catalyze progress towards those goals, the Governor will advance a new initiative, the Nuclear Reliability Backbone, directing State agencies to establish a clear pathway for additional advanced nuclear generation to support grid reliability. The Nuclear Reliability Backbone will be developed by a new Department of Public Service (DPS) process to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy that will combine with existing nuclear generation and the New York Power Authority's (NYPA) previously announced 1 gigawatt project, to create an 8.4 gigawatt “backbone” of reliable energy for New Yorkers.

This effort will provide firm, clean power that complements renewable energy resources and reduces reliance on fossil fuel generation. By creating a stable foundation of always-on energy, the Backbone will allow renewable resources to operate more efficiently and flexibly. Together, these actions will support a resilient, flexible, and zero-emission grid that meets New York’s growing energy needs.

Ensuring New York’s Nuclear Power Future is Built By and For New Yorkers

As New York expands advanced nuclear energy, the State must ensure that New Yorkers benefit from these jobs and investments; and, moreso, that New Yorkers are prepared to build, operate, and sustain this emerging industry. Governor Hochul will launch NextGen Nuclear New York to develop a skilled, in-state nuclear workforce through coordinated education and training pathways. The initiative will expand partnerships across K–12 schools, higher education institutions, labor organizations, and training programs to align curricula, credentials, and career pathways with industry needs. It will also support workforce transitions for existing energy workers and increase public awareness of nuclear career opportunities. By investing in people and skills, New York will ensure its nuclear future is powered by New Yorkers, for New Yorkers.

Requiring Data Centers To Pay Their Fair Share and Streamlining Interconnections for Job-Creating Businesses

As energy demand surges across the state, New York State will advance a new initiative with a dual mandate: providing greater certainty and predictability for businesses seeking to invest in New York while ensuring that data centers pay their fair share. Unlike other sectors, data centers consume massive amounts of finite resources and place an unprecedented strain on the electric grid without creating many jobs in the process. Governor Hochul is taking action to ensure every day New Yorkers do not subsidize this energy intensive industry. To stop planning uncertainty caused by “phantom loads” and prevent rising costs for everyday consumers, the State will enforce a simple standard: these industries must pay more; if they do not, they must supply their own energy.

To attract responsible new businesses, give them the certainty they need to invest in New York, and protect the ratepayer, Governor Hochul will tap the Department of Public Service to launch a new initiative, Energize NY Development, with the goal of modernizing how large energy users connect to the grid, making it faster and more predictable, but it comes with strict conditions to protect ratepayers. This effort will streamline interconnection rules and improve transparency around grid upgrades while explicitly requiring that projects driving exceptional demand without exceptional job creation or other benefits cover the costs they create, or supply their own energy. By accelerating responsible development and requiring data centers to shoulder their own burden, Energize NY Development will support job creation, industry growth and economic investment across the State while sparing ratepayers additional pressure on utility bills.

Protecting New York’s Energy Grid from Cyber Threats

As New York modernizes its electric grid and brings more clean energy resources online, we must protect this vital asset from cyber threats that could put our power and safety at risk. Building on nation-leading actions already underway, Governor Hochul will strengthen protections for New York’s electric grid. This effort will expand enforceable cybersecurity standards beyond traditional information technology to include the operational technology that controls power generation, transmission, and distribution, while also addressing the growing cybersecurity risks. These actions will reduce the risk of disruption, protect ratepayers from costly outages, and ensure New York’s evolving energy system remains resilient, reliable, and secure.

Supporting Solar Deployment in Public Schools by Aligning State Building Aid with Climate Goals

New York’s thousands of public schools consume substantial energy, and can and should play an important role in advancing clean energy priorities while also providing healthier learning environments for students. Looking towards a more sustainable future, many school districts are choosing to invest in solar and other renewable energy systems, which will support the state’s transition long-term. However, current Building Aid rules can limit their ability to undertake these crucial projects. Governor Hochul will update how State Building Aid is applied so school districts have greater flexibility to install the most effective renewable energy systems, including ground-mounted solar where appropriate. This change will make it easier for schools to reduce energy costs, cut emissions, and invest in cleaner infrastructure without increasing overall Building Aid.

Establishing a Sales Tax Exemption for Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations

As New York continues to work towards a greener, cleaner future, electric vehicles (EV) play an important role in weaning New Yorkers’ reliance on polluting and dangerous fuels. Governor Hochul has led the way in facilitating this transition by significantly building out the State’s EV charging infrastructure, deploying 15,000 chargers at more than 4,000 locations. This has resulted in nearly 187,000 EVs in New York. To further incentivize the installation of EV charging stations for public use, Governor Hochul will support legislation to establish a sales tax exemption on the retail sale of electricity–used to recharge an electric vehicle–by a commercial EV charging station. By encouraging additional charging options, Governor Hochul is removing historic barriers that prevent EV uptake and bringing New York one step closer to realizing its clean energy goals.

Supporting Farms Through the Sun and Soil Program

As New York expands clean energy generation, the State must ensure that renewable development and working farmland can coexist and complement one another. As farmers face rising operating costs, the transition to a clean energy economy presents opportunities to help farms diversify their revenues as they continue to operate and manage their valued farming activity.

Governor Hochul will introduce the Sun and Soil Program to increase options for farmers to benefit from the integration of solar energy development on their land while maintaining valuable land assets. The program builds on existing State-supported research and demonstration projects that show how solar panels can be co-located with active farming, such as grazing and crop production, allowing farms to generate clean energy while keeping land in agricultural use. Identifying avenues to capitalize on solar energy development while supporting continued use of productive farmland will help farmers financially and support the resiliency of their business. The program will be advised by – and inform efforts of – the state Agricultural Technical Working Group (ATWG) and will identify responsible solar development practices that support New York State’s agricultural operations, lands, farmers, and communities. The ATWG, led by NYSERDA in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, includes agricultural land and farmer organizations, solar developers and operators, local government officials, academic experts, and additional nongovernmental organizations and state agencies. By advancing research, demonstration projects, and partnerships between farmers and renewable energy developers, Sun and Soil strengthens rural economies by supporting opportunities for both clean energy growth and sustained use of productive farmland for agricultural production.

The Saudi Arabia PIF is the largest investor in the fund earmarked for the utility acquisition, investing $20 billion in the fund, half of the total initial equity investment.

To complete the proposed acquisition, Blackstone and TXNM must obtain approvals from a variety of state and federal regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NM PRC) and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).

How would this impact ratepayers – where proposed benefits fall short

In order for state utility regulators to approve this deal, it must be deemed to be in the public interest. The joint application from Blackstone and TXNM outlines provisions that attempt to make that legal argument. Predominantly, Blackstone proposes to be a long-term partner with the ability to provide adequate capital to the utilities, it will provide a sum of capital to be used for customer rate credits and economic development support, and Blackstone will retain local leadership and management. Digging into the details of these proposed benefits shows they only scratch the surface of what may be needed to provide true ratepayer protections against the proposed risks of the acquisition.

Blackstone describes its intention as TXNM’s ultimate owner to be that of a longer-term investor that will look to “serve customers and local communities for years to come” rather than focus on short term gains. That being said, an expert witness on behalf of the Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, an association of industrial energy consumers, who has access to non-public trade secret information provided by Blackstone, describes Blackstone’s plan to meet the capital needs of TNMP to be by using double leverage to increase returns. This type of leverage allows private equity investors to maximize returns by placing debt on companies the firm owns while contributing less equity in the transaction. This high risk tactic is known for amplifying returns for investors while risking financial strain at the portfolio company, which is responsible for paying back that debt.

Highlighted throughout the applications for approval by state regulators in Texas and New Mexico is a customer rate credit that would temporarily reduce bill amounts by a few dollars. The proposed credit is for New Mexico $105 million over four years. This credit may seem like a large sum of money, but distributed among PNM’s 550,000 customers, it would result in $47 a year, or about $4 a month, to each customer. Without promises to stabilize rates, those small gains could be lost ifBlackstone and TXNM file a rate case, asking the respective state regulators to raise rates. In Texas, Blackstone will be providing a $45 million rate credit over 4 years, which is about $14 per customer per month to TNMP’s over 265,000 customers.

How would this impact ratepayers – potential issues

In addition to the shortcomings of Blackstone’s proposed benefits, there are a number of additional issues that utility regulators should consider when making decisions regarding the public interest of this acquisition.

Data centers

Blackstone has not been shy about the firm’s enthusiasm for investing in data centers or participating in the AI boom, which some experts have called a bubble. Blackstone currently manages $85 billion worth of data centers globally and continues to invest in the sector for the long term. Notably, Blackstone acquired QTS Realty Trust in 2021 in part with its BIP platform. QTS is currently the largest data center operator in the world. With data centers contributing to an all-time high electricity consumption in the US in 2024, Blackstone’s motivations to materialize investments across the AI supply chain are clear, with language like this appearing on its webpage: “We have built the largest and fastest growing data center business in the world in partnership with incredibly talented teams at our portfolio companies. For years now, we have been planting the seeds for future growth and are positioning ourselves for continued leadership over the long term.”

Blackstone’s ambitions have caught the attention of Congress. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman outlining their concerns with the “firm’s recent acquisitions of publicly traded utility companies, and the extent to which these acquisitions allow you to profit from rising energy demands at the expense of consumers, utility workers, and everyday Americans trying to make their ends meet.” In the letter, the Senators expressed concerns related to potential anti-competitive effects of Blackstone owning both data centers and electrical utilities and, electricity affordability with the proposed TXNM acquisition.

Blackstone’s concerning track record of raising costs and safety risks in other industries

Blackstone is famous for being the world’s largest landlord, and has faced criticism for evictions, rent hikes, and lobbying against rent control. A 2023 Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) report found that in one county alone, Blackstone purchased over 5,000 naturally occurring affordable housing units and raised the rents between 43-64% in 2 years. The report also documented cases of Blackstone evicting tenants who owed just one month’s rent.

In addition to Blackstone’s poor track record as a responsible landlord to its tenants, the firm has faced numerous scandals related to negligent labor practices. The 2023 Private Equity Labor Scorecard found Blackstone to receive an F, performing the worst in reported wage and hour violations compared to its private equity peers. Among Blackstone’s most notorious labor violations are related to a Department of Labor investigation that found the Blackstone-owned Packers Sanitation had hired more than 100 children working in hazardous jobs, under illegal conditions with multiple children suffering injuries. Children had been hired to work at the slaughterhouse cleaning company after Blackstone had acquired the company, and Blackstone ultimately had to pay a $1.5 million fine to the DOL. As a result of this mismanagement, Moody’s downgraded PSSI due to “the loss of contracts and lawsuits related to labor issues,” leading to concerns about “management credibility and track record risk”. Blackstone’s application claims this acquisition will project jobs and wages for union workers, but there are limited details for how the firm plans to ensure workforce benefits and standards are maintained.

PESP’s role and community involvement

PESP is an intervenor in the docket for the TXNM acquisition at FERC, along with Public Citizen, Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. PESP and Public Citizen jointly filed a motion stating that FERC should find the federal application for the acquisition of TXNM by Blackstone to be deficient, as the application provides little detail about the proposed po

st-transaction corporate structure of TXNM and that the post-acquisition structure could lead to cross-subsidization of non-utility companies within Blackstone’s many subsidiaries. CBD has submitted a protest and reply in the docket outlining similar and additional concerns that the application as-submitted, stating that the proposal lacks detail about what, if any, safeguards will exist between TXNM and Blackstone’s related companies. For example, CBD poses the question of whether TXNM will serve Blackstone-owned data centers. On December 23, 2025, FERC found Blackstone’s application to be deficient and is requiring the company to submit additional information to protect customers from cross-subsidization of other Blackstone-owned companies.

Additionally, PESP is participating in the New Mexico contested case as an expert witness for intervenor New Energy Economy, a grassroots and policy advocacy nonprofit in New Mexico working to radically transform their energy systems. New Energy Economy is among a long list of intervenors in Blackstone’s proposed acquisition of their local utility, including:

Some interveners have already indicated concerns over the risk that Blackstone taking over the utility would lead to dramatic increases in energy bills. The Kroger Co.intervened as one of PNM’s largest commercial customers and voiced concerns that the cost of electricity could be “substantially impacted” by Blackstone’s purchase of the utility.

NM PRC staff and intervenors have until March 6, 2026 to file direct testimony about the proposed takeover and whether the acquisition would be aligned with the public interest. There will then be a hearing in May of 2026 which will be livestreamed for public viewing. Additionally, there is an opportunity for the public to weigh in with written public comments directly to the NM PRC.

The Trump administration violated the Fifth Amendment when it canceled clean energy grants last year based on whether the projects were located in states that voted for the president in 2024, a federal court judge ruled on Monday.

“There is no rational relationship” between the location-based grant terminations and the government’s stated interest of aligning grant funding with agency priorities, according to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruling.

The court’s decision covers seven grants totaling $27.6 million. The U.S. Department of Energy’s October terminations included more than $7.5 billion in financial awards to clean energy projects in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Dive Insight:

A DOE spokesperson said the agency disagrees with the judge’s decision and stands by its review process, “which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars.”

“The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds,” DOE representative Ben Dietderich said in an emailed statement. He did not respond to questions about a possible appeal.

The lawsuit was filed in November by St. Paul, Minnesota, and a coalition of energy and community advocates: Elevate Energy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Plug In America and the Southeast Community Organization.

“This ruling makes clear that no community should be punished for its politics,” SCO Executive Director Ianni Houmas said in a statement.

District Judge Amit Mehta’s order vacated seven termination notices but also noted the limited nature of the decision.

“By no means does the court conclude that the mere presence of political considerations in an agency action runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. That is not the law. This case is unique,” Mehta wrote. “Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024. There is no rational relationship between that classification and Defendants’ stated governmental interest.”

While the district court decision impacts a limited number of grants, EDF officials said the court’s reasoning and its legal holding would apply to “all who were subject to this unconstitutional action violating equal protection of the law.”

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law,” EDF General Counsel Vickie Patton said in a statement.

Grant terminations were vacated for projects including electric vehicle charging support, the SolSmart technical assistance program, a consumer EV education campaign, an Elevate Energy building performance resource hub and others.

“The court ruling in favor of Elevate is a step toward keeping clean energy affordable and advancing initiatives nationwide,” Elevate CEO Anne Evens said in a statement. “This decision is for the communities across the country who should not have to choose between paying their energy bills and feeding their families.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/d2DHHad9GyoNFhXfTdMplo7efzpGx8KKDXzTAjUuYUQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk5NDIwMzQ3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-13 16:13:14.965408

Trump is expected to begin his trip in Dearborn, MI, with a visit to a Ford factory that makes F-150 pickups, the bestselling domestic vehicle in the U.S., for a tour of the facilities around 12:30 p.m. His schedule also includes an address to the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino Hotel in Detroit, MI, around 2:00 p.m.

The trip comes as consumers and businesses are feeling warry of the state of the U.S. economy coming into 2026, citing concerns about inflation and tariff uncertainty. Also in a close rearview is Ford, a key player in Michigan's manufacturing, announcing a shift away from producing electric vehicles due to a $13 billion loss and an end to production of the electric F-150 Lightning, adding an additional $20 billion in estimated lost investment.

State of the economy: Consumer sentiment starts 2026 near all-time low

The Biden administration is seen as a main driver of EVs due to the incentives brought about during his term, but with the Trump administration, those incentives are gone and lead to a shift away from investments in EV infrastructure.

Michigan, a hub for the auto industry, has seen billions already invested or planned to be into EV infrastructure, such as battery manufacturing plants and vehicle charging stations, in anticipation of the vehicles taking up a larger percent of the auto market in coming years. As polities have shifted under Trump's administration, however, these efforts are stalling out.

Trump's visit to Michigan is following economy-focused speeches he gave in Pennsylvania and North Carolina last month where he insisted his tariffs have boosted the economy, despite consumers noting the squeeze of higher prices, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

In the 2016 and 2024 elections, Trump carried Michigan, but lost the state in 2020 to Joe Biden. He marked his first 100 days in office on April 29, 2025, at Macomb Community College in Warren, MI, just outside of Detroit, briefly discussing tariffs, domestic manufacturing and promoted the ""big beautiful bill."" He also spent time discussing the 2020 election, reiterating false claims that it was stolen from him.

While at Selfridge Air National Guard Base earlier in the day, joined by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Trump spoke to members of the Michigan National Guard and announced the addition of 21 new F-15EXs fighter jets in part of the ""game-changing"" new F15-EX fighter mission, planned to begin arriving in FY28.

He also announced intentions for a one trillion dollar national defense budget and a new Selfridge defense shield named ""Golden Dome"" to protect Michigan from ""missile attack.""

The Detroit Economic Club is expecting a full house, and tickets, offered to Detroit Economic Club members and their guests, are sold out.

Nearby, the Michigan Freedom Coalition is organizing a protest in response to Trump's visit, focusing their qualms on a rising cost of living and what they consider to be excessive aggressive federal immigration enforcement, such as the recent killing of Minneapolis, MIN, protestor Renee Nicole Good and the shooting of two Portland, OR, protestors.

The agency plans to stop considering the value of lives saved when setting regulatory limits, focusing instead on the costs to industry. The change was announced with little public attention, but it represents a significant break from decades of regulatory practice. The Clean Air Act, dating back to 1963, established a framework in which reducing pollution was understood to save lives, and those benefits were explicitly considered in policymaking. Over time, that approach contributed to substantial improvements in air quality, reductions in pollution-related illness, and longer life expectancy across the United States. Accounting for lives saved was not incidental to this progress. It was central to how public health protections were justified and sustained. Removing lives saved from regulatory analysis marks a shift away from that public health foundation. When benefits to human health are no longer counted, protections become easier to weaken and harder to defend. This decision belongs to a broader dismantling of public health infrastructure, where protections are weakened not by overt repeal, but by removing the tools that once made them defensible. https://lnkd.in/g8wTN-Az",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGhEGo4RB7MrQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56Zu0uydxIQAw-/0/1768263723508?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ewnUj8aoFXxg_tzyOkf2VUNYAXmV-y3FOZ9p5ncscMc,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:22.856796

EPTCs

On Jan. 8, seventeen house Republicans voted for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ three-year extension of enhanced premium tax subsidies (EPTC); notably, several Republican members of Congress who had previously remained quiet on the issue bucked party leadership to vote in favor of the extension. Now Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) must navigate differing views within his caucus. A bipartisan group of senators is reportedly exploring a potential compromise, with discussions rumored to be led by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio).

Hearing Recaps

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing to examine several legislative proposals aimed at supporting patient access to Medicare services. Republicans emphasized that the bills under consideration would address reimbursement methodologies, improve data transparency, and help stabilize providers to better align Medicare payment with current care delivery models. Democrats acknowledged the value of the bills under discussion but criticized the failure to extend EPTCs and recent cuts to health care; members argued that rising premiums, Medicare Advantage practices, and potential coverage losses pose significant risks to patient access and should be addressed alongside narrower, Medicare‑focused legislative proposals.

From that base, ReElement and Transition Equity Partners (TEP) said they intend to develop additional refining facilities across the United States and in select international markets.
With TEP’s backing, American Resources said the Marion plant is expected to reach an initial production capacity of more than 10,000 metric tons per annum of refined critical minerals.
The company also cited a partnership with POSCO International to support U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.
We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.”","American Resources announced ReElement Technologies has closed a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners that the companies plan to use to scale U.S.-based critical mineral and rare earth refining capacity, starting with an expansion of ReElement’s Marion, Indiana operations.

American Resources said the financing supports the commercial deployment of ReElement’s proprietary multi-mineral refining platform, with near-term work centered on building out the Marion site to meet domestic demand for refined critical minerals used across electrification, advanced manufacturing, and defense-related supply chains. From that base, ReElement and Transition Equity Partners (TEP) said they intend to develop additional refining facilities across the United States and in select international markets.

The Marion facility is expected to serve as an anchor for a modular, scalable platform designed to process both light and heavy rare earths, as well as other critical elements associated with defense and industrial applications. ReElement’s process uses chromatographic separation methods that the company says can be deployed in a smaller footprint than traditional refinery configurations and can be scaled in a modular way as feedstock availability and demand increase.

With TEP’s backing, American Resources said the Marion plant is expected to reach an initial production capacity of more than 10,000 metric tons per annum of refined critical minerals. ReElement said it plans to source inputs from recycled feedstocks alongside mined mixed rare earth concentrates, while maintaining the flexibility to expand capacity further in Marion and at other locations the partners consider strategically important.

The companies framed the investment as part of a broader effort to strengthen U.S. and allied-nation supply chains for minerals and materials that face persistent sourcing constraints. ReElement said it is pursuing large-scale domestic processing and refining capabilities and pointed to recent collaborations aimed at building a vertically integrated rare earth magnet supply chain in the United States. The company also cited a partnership with POSCO International to support U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

ReElement said its refining platform is intended to address demand for heavy rare earth elements and other defense-relevant materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States, including minerals such as yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, and dysprosium. The company characterized these materials as important inputs for energy technologies, advanced electronics, and defense systems, while highlighting supply constraints and export controls that can affect availability in global markets.

TEP said its investment is designed to help broaden the range of domestic and allied feedstocks that can be converted into refined outputs, supporting supply chain resilience across energy and infrastructure priorities. ReElement said the equity facility also supports its longer-term international expansion plans, including work across regions such as Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

ReElement, a portfolio company of American Resources, positions its platform as a multi-feedstock refining process that can handle recycled rare earth permanent magnets and lithium-ion battery materials, as well as concentrated ores, brines, and coal-based waste streams and byproducts. The company said its approach supports a circular supply chain model by converting multiple types of raw and recycled inputs into high-purity products needed for industrial and defense uses.

Transition Equity Partners, founded in 2020, described itself as a North American mid-market private equity firm focused on power generation, energy infrastructure, and clean energy supply chains and services, with offices in Chicago, New York, and Abu Dhabi. The firm said it partners closely with management teams and projects aligned with its thematic investment strategy.

KEY QUOTES:

“We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise — an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP’s global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement’s international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement’s global growth.”

Mark Jensen, CEO, ReElement Technologies

“TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure. ReElement’s uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement’s collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2021/08/American-Resources-Corporation.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:45.903400

Governor Hochul will also provide support to agencies to consider and implement new technologies to help streamline reviews.
We applaud Governor Hochul for taking on this common-sense legislation that will cut red tape and encourage more transit ridership across the region.""
This proposal is a concrete example of Governor Hochul listening to our call to make New York State more competitive.","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced her “Let Them Build” agenda, a series of landmark reforms to speed up housing and infrastructure projects and lower costs as part of her 2026 State of the State. “Let Them Build” is about making government work better on behalf of New Yorkers. This initiative will spur a series of common sense reforms to New York’s State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and executive actions to expedite critical categories of projects that have been consistently found to not have adverse environmental impacts. Together, these actions will allow projects that localities want to move forward and that will not harm the environment do so faster, while prioritizing smarter growth to ensure we continue to protect communities, preserve our environment, and conserve New York’s natural resources.

“New York has always been a place of boundless ambitions: from the Erie Canal to the Empire State Building. But for too long, unnecessary red tape has stood in the way of new housing and critical infrastructure.” Governor Hochul said. “If local leaders want to deliver new investments for their communities, I say ‘Let Them Build.’”

Today, it is too difficult to build major projects in New York: an analysis by Empire State Development found that manufacturing, housing and energy projects can take as much as 56 percent longer in New York State to get from concept to groundbreaking compared to peer states. Longer projects equal higher costs, a challenge that is especially critical in the context of New York’s housing crisis, where the only solution to high costs and scarce homes is to build more housing faster and cheaper than before. Similarly, unduly burdensome requirements delay needed investment in clean water infrastructure, child care centers, and parks.

Helping Our Communities Build Housing We Need

When Governor Hochul took office, she vowed to tackle the housing crisis and bring down costs by building the housing that New Yorkers desperately need so that more hard working families can afford a place to call home. However, too many projects in New York, including much-needed affordable housing developments, are forced to navigate a web of red tape created by state mandates that add unnecessary costs and years of needless delays, despite these projects consistently being found to have no significant environmental impact. Studies have quantified how State-mandated environmental review can slow down housing projects by an average of two years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per project, at a time when New Yorkers can least afford the wait for the housing they need to continue to live and thrive in New York.

To speed up the development of housing to create a more affordable and sustainable New York, Governor Hochul will propose to amend the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) to exempt certain types of housing projects that have no significant impacts on the environment, which are still subject to local zoning, from additional SEQRA review. Projects will still be required to comply with crucial State regulatory and permit requirements governing water use, air quality, environmental justice, and protection of natural resources, as well as local zoning and other permitting requirements. Projects must also be located outside of flood risk areas in order to qualify. The type of housing project that can be reclassified under SEQRA will differ according to the housing needs and contexts of different parts of the state. In New York City, the State will set caps on the size a building must be to avoid the requirement of additional SEQRA review, with caps varying on the basis of the density of the neighborhoods as determined by the City. In the rest of the state, to avoid additional SEQRA review, housing projects must be on previously disturbed land, connected to existing water and sewer systems, and subject to additional unit caps.

A review by New York City and New York State Homes and Community Renewal over the last five to ten years of over a thousand housing projects found that virtually none of such projects ultimately were found to have significant environmental impacts, but nevertheless were still subject to lengthy reviews. These reforms will accelerate the delivery of much needed housing and reduce the cost of building in ways that are consistent with sustainable and environmentally-protective development, driving down the cost of housing and rents across the state while protecting our natural resources.

Accelerating Critical Infrastructure Projects That New Yorkers Depend On

Governor Hochul will also propose to facilitate the speedier, cheaper delivery of a broad range of beneficial infrastructure projects that New Yorkers depend on. She will propose to adjust SEQRA’s classifications to allow the following important categories of projects not in need of additional SEQRA review to start serving New Yorkers faster:

Clean Water Infrastructure: Critical water infrastructure projects that avoid impacts to natural resources.

Green Infrastructure: Nature-based storm water management.

Parks and Trails: Public parks and recreational bike/pedestrian paths on previously disturbed land.

Child Care: New or renovated child care centers on previously disturbed land.

Governor Hochul’s proposal would reserve these fast-track environmental review processes for only those projects proceeding at previously disturbed areas, meaning areas that have already been developed or improved, which provides the dual benefit of protecting our natural resources and undisturbed lands, while strengthening our neighborhoods. The Governor’s approach would yield tangible environmental benefits including improved air and water quality, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the preservation of critical habitats when compared to policies which encourage sprawl and unchecked development of natural areas. In addition, Governor Hochul will direct the New York Power Authority and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to update their regulations to facilitate and speed up the deployment of clean energy projects.

Combined, these actions will drastically reduce administrative steps and accelerate project timelines, while maintaining local zoning requirements and environmental standards of all other state permits, ensuring progress does not come at the expense of New Yorkers or natural resources.

Delivering Faster Decisions for Local Communities Through Clear Timelines and Accountability

Currently SEQRA review timelines vary greatly across projects, creating unpredictability for local communities, project sponsors, and state agencies alike. This unpredictability can contribute to significant project delays and add substantial costs to project budgets. To drive further accountability and streamline the environmental review process, Governor Hochul will ensure project review is subject to a two-year maximum deadline for completion of a SEQRA environmental impact statement from a positive declaration (i.e., the initial decision to move forward with an environmental impact statement) to the issuance of the final agency decision. Extensions could be evaluated in certain circumstances.

Governor Hochul will also clarify exactly when the time to challenge an environmental review begins to accrue. This change aligns the legal clock for environmental concerns with the clock for the project’s actual permits, such as a site plan or subdivision approval. By doing this, the State removes court confusion and ensures that all legal challenges follow the same schedule.

Streamlining Environmental Impact Statements To Cut Down Review Timelines

To accelerate the process of developing Environmental Impact Statements, which are time-intensive assessments of how a proposed project would impact the environment, Governor Hochul will direct the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to develop ‘Generic Environmental Impact Statements' (GEISs). GEISs are comprehensive reviews for common project types which allow developers to quickly progress through the environmental review process and guide their upfront decision making and site selection. Governor Hochul will direct DEC to develop new GEISs to cut down environmental review timelines for selected types of renewable energy and housing projects.

Modernizing New York’s Permitting Processes to Save Time and Money for Localities

It has been decades since some of New York’s state agencies have updated their processes and technologies used to review and approve permits, which are a critical and often time-consuming step in building desired new infrastructure. Outdated permitting processes drive up costs and create needless bureaucratic hoops for projects to jump through. To modernize and expedite these processes, Governor Hochul will direct state agencies involved in permitting and environmental reviews to conduct an end-to-end review of their processes and identify opportunities to accelerate reviews and alleviate bottlenecks.

Governor Hochul will also provide support to agencies to consider and implement new technologies to help streamline reviews. As part of this effort, the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) will launch “Smart Access,” a consolidated platform for applicants and government agencies to follow the progress of permits and environmental reviews in real time and access the latest documents. In addition, to drive accountability, increase transparency, and help agencies meet timelines established in law, Governor Hochul will direct state agencies, in partnership with the newly established Office of Performance Management and Innovation (OPMI), to develop internal performance tracking systems to monitor the status of permits and environmental reviews.

Together, these efforts will help us accelerate project reviews, while maintaining our commitment to important permits and reviews intended to protect our environment and keep our communities safe.

Expediting Major State Infrastructure Projects to Serve New Yorkers Faster

To help expedite the delivery of the most significant projects in the state, Governor Hochul will establish a new program to streamline and speed up permitting processes for key economic development and infrastructure projects across New York, within the relevant legislative framework. The program would oversee and monitor the permitting process of designated projects of statewide significance such as the new Nuclear Generation Project in Upstate New York or the new IBX transit line in New York City to reduce wait times for the workers, businesses, students and families who depend on these projects while continuing to prioritize safety. For designated projects, the program would be responsible for setting and overseeing clear, transparent permitting schedules; assist with interagency, federal, and local coordination; accelerate permitting processes; and address other issues as they arise.

Supporting Local Communities Through a Permitting Academy

Many localities face significant challenges navigating the complicated web of local, state, and federal permitting requirements, especially smaller localities with limited staff. To tackle this issue, the State will provide enhanced support and education to local governments to help them better understand the SEQRA process, which will help ensure a more effective environmental review. The State, in partnership with Regional Economic Development Councils, will conduct a series of workshops with local governments to cover best practices and provide assistance for localities in need of additional support.

Driving Economic Growth by Activating Underutilized Sites in the North Country

New York’s commitment to our forest preserves, including the Adirondack Park, is defined by the “Forever Wild” clause, which is a constitutional promise that our Forest Preserve will remain a pristine legacy for generations. However, today, several former correctional facilities - Camp Gabriels, Moriah Shock, and Mount McGregor - sit dormant. These crumbling sites are more than just eyesores; they are environmental hazards and lost opportunities for the people who call the North Country home.

To address this, Governor Hochul will propose a constitutional amendment to return these underutilized sites to productive and critically-needed uses, such as for housing development, while also securing a win for conservation. By authorizing the redevelopment of these specific locations, Governor Hochul will at the same time propose adding even more land into the Forest Preserve.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said, ""We cannot address our housing crisis without making it easier to build housing in New York City. Environmental review reform would bring our regulations into the 21st century and ensure we can deliver an affordability agenda on the timetable needed,"" said New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. ""I commend Governor Hochul for this commonsense proposal and hope it will be a part of the enacted state budget this year. New Yorkers can't wait any longer for action on housing.""

New York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Carlina Rivera said, The Governor’s proposed ‘Let Them Build Agenda,’ including changes to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) aimed at streamlining approvals for certain housing and infrastructure projects, is both welcome and necessary. NYSAFAH has consistently advocated for reforms that strike the right balance between accelerating the construction of much needed housing and maintaining strong environmental protections. These changes will help remove unnecessary delays, reduce costs, and allow responsible projects to move forward more efficiently, which is critical to addressing New York’s housing shortage at the scale the crisis demands.”

SEIU 32BJ President Manny Pastreich said, “We have a housing crisis. How we address that crisis must be balanced with the environmental impacts of new building. This policy proposal maintains environmental protections, while making it less cumbersome for housing to get built. Governor Kathy Hochul is striking the right balance here.”

President of the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council Rich Maroko said, ""New York’s housing crisis threatens the livelihoods of hardworking families across our state. Once again, Governor Hochul’s bold strategy demonstrates real leadership and a clear commitment to making New York more affordable for the people who live and work here.”

City of New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert said, “Local governments are on the front lines of delivering housing, infrastructure, and community improvements, and lengthy, duplicative review processes can slow down projects residents are counting on. Governor Hochul’s proposal to modernize SEQRA recognizes the need to protect our environment while also making it easier for communities to move forward responsibly. By reducing unnecessary delays and improving coordination, these reforms will help lower costs, increase transparency, and allow municipalities like ours to plan and build more effectively. I appreciate the Governor’s leadership in advancing thoughtful reforms that support sustainable growth and stronger, more resilient communities.”

City of Peekskill Mayor Vivian C. McKenzie said, “For local governments, time matters. Governor Hochul’s proposal to modernize SEQRA is about cutting through unnecessary delays so communities can move forward on housing, infrastructure, and quality-of-life projects residents have been waiting for. These reforms respect environmental protections while giving cities and towns the tools we need to plan, build, and grow responsibly. I appreciate the Governor’s leadership in recognizing that smart reform can strengthen both our environment and our local economies.”

Village of Pelham Mayor and Housing Council Executive Director Chance Mullen said, “Local leaders have been calling for SEQRA reform for years, and it’s encouraging to see Governor Hochul listening. I’m cautiously optimistic this proposal can help communities deliver the housing our residents need while cutting unnecessary red tape. Making it easier to build homes is essential to easing costs for everyday New Yorkers and meeting the needs of our constituents.”

Village of Fredonia Mayor Mike Ferguson said, “Governor Hochul’s proposed amendment to current items of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) will have the largest impact by helping to eliminate more roadblocks for citizens wanting to buy small-scale and multi-family homes. This will remove yet another financial burden for homebuyers. That’s a big help to communities our size. Once again the Governor is showing that she fights for families and fights for us everyday.”

East Hampton Town Supervisor Kathee Burke-Gonzalez said, “East Hampton needs more affordable housing so the people who keep our town running can continue living here, including teachers, health care workers, first responders, town employees, and young families. I appreciate Governor Hochul for making this a priority and for backing a clearer, more consistent review process that helps communities build the homes New Yorkers need while continuing to protect our environment, our water, and our open space.”

Rochester Mayor Malik Evans said, “I applaud Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed regulatory reforms, which will continue to protect our environment while cutting through unnecessary red tape. These reforms will allow us to move expeditiously on projects that are critical to the health and safety of our residents.”

Partnership for New York City President and CEO Kathryn Wylde said, “The SEQRA process has long been in need of reform. It is overly bureaucratic and lengthy. It is great that Governor Hochul will take on this unnecessary contributor to the high cost of housing development in the city.”

Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and CEO, and Former Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy said, “I applaud Governor Hochul’s plan to reform and modernize the SEQR process. The current process and elongated timelines have made NYS far less attractive and competitive for construction and growth. The current SEQR process along with other regulatory impediments have dramatically slowed down home construction at a time when NYS needs housing now more than ever. The Governor is spot on with her proposal - which will have a profound impact on housing, construction, and our economy.”

Regional Plan Association President and CEO Tom Wright said, “Reforms to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) will help fast-track the smart, sustainable infrastructure our region needs, and we commend Governor Kathy Hochul for her bold leadership in taking on this long-overdue work. For over one hundred years, RPA has focused on one core mission: improving quality of life across the tri-state region by advancing solutions that lead to economic vitality, environmental resilience, and healthy, thriving communities. SEQR modernization will greenlight the housing, energy, and transit investments New Yorkers support, and that our region needs to remain competitive, equitable, and resilient.”

Association for a Better Long Island Executive Director Kyle Strober said, ""This is a significant update for the New York economic development community. One of the biggest hurdles that economic development projects face is unpredictable timelines and prohibitive soft costs for small to mid-sized projects. These reforms, proposed by Governor Hochul, will help spur economic development, create housing and help make New York more affordable.""

Long Island Contractors’ Association Executive Director Marc Herbst said, “Contractors across Long Island welcome efforts to modernize SEQRA so essential infrastructure projects can move forward in a more timely and predictable way. Streamlining reviews for projects with minimal environmental impact will help communities deliver critical upgrades to roads, water, energy, and public facilities — supporting good-paying local jobs while maintaining strong environmental standards.”

Open New York Executive Director Annemarie Gray said, “Modernizing SEQRA is about restoring faith that our government can deliver on the things New Yorkers need. When critical projects spend five years being delayed by paperwork, people lose faith in government. Right now, we’re facing both an affordability crisis and a climate crisis—these demand immediate action, and New York families can’t afford to wait years for delays driven by frivolous lawsuits. We commend Governor Kathy Hochul for taking this on and urge the State Legislature to pass SEQRA reform in this year’s state budget.”

Citizens Budget Commission President Andrew Rein said, “We commend Governor Hochul for proposing this bold step to boost much-needed housing production. Reforming the onerous environmental review process will make building housing cheaper and faster, without additional cost to the State. That's the sort of smart choice that will make our state more affordable and competitive.”

Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA Executive Director Lisa Daglian said, ""SEQR reform is a crucial complement to transit-oriented development projects around the MTA region, simultaneously combating the housing affordability and climate change crises. We applaud Governor Hochul for taking on this common-sense legislation that will cut red tape and encourage more transit ridership across the region.""

New York State Economic Development Council Executive Director Ryan M. Silva said, “Cutting through red tape and reducing timelines for project approvals is critical to achieve our housing, economic development, and renewable energy goals. The governor’s proposal to exempt housing projects from SEQRA and install a two year cap for review is an important and necessary first step to help support New York’s business climate. These initiatives will help reduce project costs, create predictability in the permitting approval process, and create economic opportunity across the state.”

New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen J. Acquario said, “Counties across New York State recognize that the State Environmental Quality Review Act plays an important role in protecting our natural resources and communities, but we also know that the current SEQR process can be overly complex, time-consuming, and costly — often delaying housing and infrastructure projects that have little or no environmental impact. We welcome the Governor’s review of the SEQR framework and look forward to working with her and the Legislature to modernize the process in a way that preserves strong environmental protections while allowing counties and municipalities to deliver the housing and infrastructure New Yorkers urgently need.”

Westchester County Association President & CEO Michael N. Romita said, “Governor Hochul’s SEQRA reforms are a very important step toward addressing the state’s critical housing shortage. Notwithstanding its noble underpinnings, over the past half century, SERQRA has become increasingly abused by overuse and modernization is overdue. These reforms do not override local control, and they don’t require communities to change their zoning. Rather, they empower local officials to meet today’s needs.”

Long Island Association President & CEO Matt Cohen said, “Red tape and overregulation stifles innovation and hinders sorely needed projects that contribute to economic growth. The LIA commends the Governor’s proposal to streamline environmental reviews for new housing, which would go a long way to addressing our existential cost-of-living crisis on Long Island.”

Adirondack Association of Towns and Villages President, Essex County Chair of Board of Legislators, and Minerva Town Supervisor Steve McNally said, “Although it’s not going to be the silver bullet for the housing crisis, it will certainly expedite things. The Governor is really listening and we appreciate the help she is giving us.”

New York State Business Council President & CEO Heather Mulligan said, “New York’s housing shortage is an ongoing economic concern in all regions of New York State. Modernizing environmental review rules — without hindering protections — can cut years of red tape, lower construction costs, and accelerate the delivery of housing that families and workers can afford. Expediting essential investment projects — will support job creation, community growth, and help make New York more competitive.”

Rockland Business Association CEO Jeffrey Greenberg said, “Governor Hochul’s proposal to cut red tape and modernize permitting is a smart, common-sense step for New York. By streamlining outdated processes while preserving environmental protections and public input, these reforms will help Rockland move critical projects forward faster and at a lower cost while simultaneously supporting economic growth across New York State.”

Westchester Business Council Vice President John Ravits said, “The BCW has always advocated for SEQR Reform. Governor Hochul’s proposal to streamline New York’s permitting and environmental review process is a practical step toward helping communities get projects built more efficiently. By reducing unnecessary delays while maintaining strong environmental safeguards and public engagement, these reforms will lower costs, improve timelines, and support the housing, infrastructure, and economic development projects our region needs.”

New York State Builders Association President Peter Florey said, “It is important that we get back to the original intent of the SEQR process which was to protect our environment. SEQR was not intended to be used as a means of slowing or preventing much needed housing production. Governor Hochul's meaningful recommendations will go a long way towards ensuring that SEQR is used to help housing production and affordability while also safeguarding our environment.”

Enterprise Community Partners Senior Vice President of Programs Baaba Halm said, “When it comes to delivering affordable housing, every second counts. Too often, SEQR creates lengthy, costly, and sometimes insurmountable barriers to affordable housing projects. Enterprise applauds Governor Hochul for recognizing sensible SEQR reform as a way to accelerate the delivery of the affordable homes that New Yorkers so desperately need.""

Real Estate Board of New York Executive Vice President of Public Policy Basha Gerhards said, “The Governor’s thoughtful reforms to SEQRA will accelerate new housing production and save significant time and money. We applaud the administration for identifying a solution to streamline this process while protecting the opportunity for local review.”

The Building & Realty Institute of the Hudson Valley CEO Tim Foley said, “""We know that good housing policy and good climate policy go hand in hand, and that well-designed, energy-efficient infill housing that repurposes already-developed sites can help solve our housing shortage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. Too often the very projects that would be a net benefit for the environment and the community get ensnared in lengthy, unpredictable, and costly environmental reviews and challenges. We applaud Governor Hochul's leadership in proposing a way to clear these logjams and create incentives for the kind of mildly-dense, sustainably-built housing we need to secure an affordable New York for all who wish to live and work here.""

Long Island Builders Institute CEO Mike Florio said, “New York’s housing shortage is a crisis that demands action, and Governor Hochul’s proposed reforms to SEQRA are a critical step in the right direction. SEQRA was never intended to be a tool to delay or block much-needed housing for years at a time. Modernizing the review process while maintaining strong environmental protections will help communities add housing faster, reduce costs for families, and support smart, responsible growth across Long Island and New York State.”

Capital Region Chamber and Center for Economic Growth President and CEO Mark Eagan said, “Faced with so much red tape, it can be daunting to do business in New York State. This proposal is a concrete example of Governor Hochul listening to our call to make New York State more competitive. It will allow developers the ability to build more housing thereby addressing the affordability crisis.”

Orange County Partnership Center for Economic Development President & CEO Conor Eckert said, ""By modernizing SEQRA, New York can work together to advance job-creating economic development projects more efficiently while maintaining strong environmental protections. These reforms will help attract investment, strengthen regional economies, and ensure communities across the state can grow and thrive. We thank Governor Hochul for her leadership on this issue.”

Long Island Housing Services Executive Director Ian Wilder said, “On Long Island, SEQRA has long been an essential tool for protecting our drinking water, open space, and air quality, and those protections must remain strong. At the same time, a small number of bad-faith challenges have abused the statute to delay or derail lawful, environmentally responsible housing — particularly infill development, code-compliant homes with appropriate sewage systems, and accessory dwelling units. Thoughtful SEQRA reform restores balance. It preserves meaningful environmental review while reducing misuse that has worsened traffic congestion and fueled sprawl that puts greater strain on groundwater and infrastructure. On an island with limited land and a severe housing shortage, smart, compact housing is not in conflict with environmental protection — it is one of the most effective ways to achieve it.”

Central New York Fair Housing Executive Director Sally Santangelo said, “Fair housing flourishes in communities that support housing diversity, walkability, and public transportation. CNY Fair Housing supports SEQR reform that updates this important environmental protection to foster inclusive and sustainable growth in order to expand housing opportunities for all people in New York State.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2023-10/Affordable-Housing-Generic-Hero.jpg?h=b08ee015&itok=ePBJGNYH,N,,2026-01-13 21:12:48.689484

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate.
For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions.
Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.
Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.","If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of your lunch, it would be pretty difficult to do the calculation without the sandwich. But it appears that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving in this same direction—removing the benefit—when it comes to air pollution regulations.

According to a New York Times report based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced analysis on the EPA website—the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs.

Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate. At the more tractable end of the spectrum, they can calculate things like health care costs and lost economic productivity for people whose health worsens. Even this requires an estimate of how much of a health impact to expect for a given change in pollution.

But what’s the intrinsic dollar value of someone’s health? Attempts to tackle that thorny question in some practical way result in estimates known as “value of a statistical life.” The EPA has described this as “how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.” Having this number gives us something to hold up next to the cost of that pollution control equipment.

The move to exclude the estimated benefits relates specifically to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (known as PM2.5) and ozone. This particulate matter, commonly produced by combustion, is small enough to make it through your respiratory system and into your bloodstream. For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions. That has made research on those impacts the target of anti-regulation advocates who claim scientists exaggerate the harm.

Ozone is also a familiar enough pollutant in smoggy areas to be mentioned in weather forecasts as a warning for people with conditions like asthma. Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.

The new EPA language claims that past analyses have failed to adequately represent the scientific uncertainty of the economic value of reducing these pollutants. The new economic impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines, for example, says this “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality.” It continues, “Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

A 2024 regulatory impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines had estimated those benefits at $27–$92 million per year for a tightening of emissions limits.

This is not the first time that these numbers have become political targets. Between 2004 and 2008, the Bush administration reduced the EPA’s value of a statistical life by around 11 percent. But instead of moving numbers to the lower end of scientific estimates, the Trump administration is more aggressively weaponizing scientific uncertainty. Functionally, the logic is that since estimates of benefits vary from large to extremely large, the EPA will default to a value of zero. Only the costs will be calculated, and those numbers are sure to be highlighted as justification for loosening pollution limits.

Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2182255823-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 17:00:20.912448

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.
“The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said.
“To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities.
“This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.

When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2021, authorizing more than $11 billion in new funding to reclaim lands and waterways damaged by abandoned coal mines, the people who lead this work on the ground were ecstatic.

“We were to the moon,” said Amanda Pitzer, the executive director at Friends of the Cheat, a nonprofit organization in West Virginia that works to restore the Cheat River watershed. “Once that big influx of money was announced, with West Virginia on track to receive $2.1 billion over those 15 years, we thought, ‘Now’s the time. Now’s the time to invest in water treatment.’”

But Congress wants to claw back some of that funding.

Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that would withdraw $500 million of the money allocated in 2021 for abandoned mine cleanup projects. The states that stand to lose the most are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, according to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, an environmental organization that works on conservation issues in central and southern Appalachia. The bill must still pass the Senate, which plans to take it up this week, and be signed by the president before it becomes law.

“We’re horribly disappointed,” Pitzer said. “Less money means less reclamation, period.” Among the projects that Pitzer’s organization champions are the building and maintenance of treatment systems that clean up acid mine drainage, a type of pollution that harms aquatic wildlife.

Federal budget bill would raid fund for cleaning up abandoned coal mines

In West Virginia, she said, Abandoned Mine Land funding has also been used to help build public water lines in communities where pollution has affected drinking water supplies. Although significant progress has been made in cleaning up the Cheat River since the 1990s, much more work remains to be done, Pitzer said.

The House bill proposes using the siphoned funding to pay for wildland fire management and U.S. Forest Service operations. “I think it’s highly inappropriate of Congress to rob Peter to pay Paul,” said Andy McAllister, the regional coordinator of the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.

McAllister was particularly upset about the “yes” votes from Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation in the House. All but one member voted for the bill.

Pennsylvania has the most abandoned mines of any state, McAllister said. Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania have created a range of environmental and public safety problems, from underground fires and subsidence to sinkholes and pollution affecting more than 5,500 miles of waterways.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimated it would need $5 billion to fully remediate abandoned mine lands and the waterways they contaminated. Forty-five of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are impacted.

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.

Experts are worried that this “repurposing” of the fund could continue beyond this year, with Congress dipping into the money for other reasons. “The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said. “It just feels very shortsighted.”

Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices, said his group assumes that passing this bill will lead to an annual reduction in funding. Zedack and McAllister said they have not heard back from legislators they’ve reached out to with their concerns.

The offices of Pennsylvania’s senators, Republican Dave McCormick and Democrat John Fetterman, did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News.

Zedack and McAllister both pointed out that the loss of funding will harm local economies. Unremediated mine land can’t be used for development, for example.

“Projects that are funded through this provide jobs in historically depressed areas,” McAllister said. Those opportunities can help to offset job losses from the declining coal industry.

Joe Pizarchik, the former head of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which oversees AML funding, grew up in western Pennsylvania. The region is also losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue, he said. Many waterways are so impaired by mining pollution that they can’t be used for fishing or recreation.

Pizarchik said this isn’t the first time the federal government has reduced the funding available to help communities in coal country since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was first passed in 1977.

“There was a fee put in place on every ton of coal produced to help clean up the messes of the past,” he said. Over time, the fees have shrunk. “Congress is taking back money again to continue to punish the impoverished communities that have been suffering for a century,” he said.

“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. “To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities.

Pitzer agreed. “The program was initially structured to collect a fee to pay for sins of the past, and that money should stay in coal country. It should not be redirected to other needs and other places,” Pitzer said. “This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lick-run-sept-2019-2-1024x6831768316449.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=Q24VKEz_,N,,2026-01-13 23:00:20.706863

That mindset is not enough. If Michigan wants to secure long-term prosperity, we must lead. Whether it’s taxes, regulations, workforce development, or education, Michigan needs to think about filling the Treasury with prosperity, not pain.

Michigan families and businesses are feeling the pressure of rising property tax assessments, which raises the cost of housing and other expenses. The “uncapping” of property taxes at the time of sale has led to a stagnant market with older adults refusing to subject themselves to increased taxes when they sell their existing home and purchase a new one.Property taxes require review and reform if Michigan is serious about affordability.

Economic development incentives deserve the same scrutiny. The state spent nearly $2 billion to land the Blue Oval battery plant in Marshall. While these jobs are welcome, we should ask a hard question: are massive, one-off incentives the most effective way to grow Michigan’s economy? A strong infrastructure and elimination of burdensome regulations would attract sustainable investments far better.

Roads, bridges, and reasonable energy costs are the backbone of economic growth. Yet Michigan often manages itself into crisis funding—waiting until systems fail before acting, then scrambling to patch the problem at a higher cost. Preventive investment and disciplined spending are not glamorous, but they are essential. Repealing the renewable energy laws is a must. All forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and clean should be part of the solution, including nuclear and natural gas.

Today, the Legislature may pass a law, but the real impact is often determined by unelected bureaucrats through rulemaking. Regulatory burdens often exceed legislative intent and stifle innovation without accountability. The Legislature must take back final rule making approval to ensure the implementation of passed legislation meets those expectations.

Incentivizing companies to relocate or expand here without ensuring a skilled workforce only achieves half the goal. We cannot continue to push every student toward a four-year degree while neglecting the trades that keep our economy running. Trade schools and apprenticeships must be promoted with the same urgency as universities. We must refocus our career prep, so it is both student/parent chosen and meets our state’s needs.

Education reform begins earlier than job training. We need to be honest about failing schools and identify why students are falling behind. Phonics-based literacy instruction must be prioritized. Allowing students to advance without mastering fundamentals must be ended. We must be willing to have discussions about school district consolidation (beginning with large administrative services). Reduce overhead, reward better outcomes, improve teacher pay with saved costs, and focus on the student!

Leading means making choices before circumstances force them upon us. It means building systems that work for the next generation.

“Then the wind projects started to die down, and we saw more solar projects.","Editor’s note: This is the second in an eight-part series, called “Paved Over,” exploring the impact of tech-driven development on U.S. farmland. Stories will focus on data center expansion, solar development, the impact to farmers losing land and possible solutions.

Central Arizona farmer Noah Hiscox is among the last holdouts in Pinal County. So far, more than 20,000 acres of farmland have been converted to solar panels in adjacent Coolidge and Eloy counties.

“It was kind of like cancer. It just kept growing and before they realized, ‘My goodness, this could kill us.’ The community became united against it,” Hiscox said. “Nobody likes it. Nobody wants to see it. Everybody’s unhappy with it.”

Beyond aesthetics, Hiscox said the panels have created a heat island effect, driving temperatures upward.

“If it doesn’t get down into the 70s at night, cotton doesn’t pollinate,” he said. “Last summer, we had the most high-nighttime lows in history. Consequently, it hurt our yields considerably. We had a lot of nights up in the 80s. Our yields were probably off by half a bale last year.”

As domestic energy needs surge, solar development is transforming America’s agricultural landscape. Of more than 3,000 utility-scale solar projects built in rural areas between 2012 and 2020, 43% were built on cropland, according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service. That percentage is much higher in the Midwest, where 70% cover productive acres. That’s 7.25 million acres of solar arrays nationwide — and growing.

Caught between economic opportunity brought on by rising land value and farmland preservation, farmers worry about tile damage, environmental impact, and the loss of rented farmland when property owners choose solar development over agriculture.

Quality, not quantity

The American Farmland Trust, an advocacy organization, projects that more than 10 million acres of land will be needed for utility-scale solar by 2050. This expansion is targeting highly productive farmland surrounding energy transmission corridors where solar arrays cluster. Ohio’s Power Siting Board recently approved a 2,000-plus acre solar development near Jon Miller’s property, a row crop farm near Pleasantville.

“We’re in a prime location for crop production. I hate to see the loss of super-productive ground,” Miller said. “I’m all about property owners’ rights. If the landowners want to [sell], that’s up to them. But I think there’s a better place to stick solar than on a productive acre of ground.”

When compared to the nation’s 900 million farmland acres, solar’s projected allotment might seem statistically insignificant. But there’s a caveat: More than 80% will likely span highly productive farm areas.

“Not all farmland is created equal,” said Greg Plotkin, the American Farmland Trust’s senior manager for smart solar outreach and engagement. “It’s not necessarily the amount of farmland that’s being taken out of production as much as it is the quality of the land that’s being taken out of production.”

It’s a story with no villain — nor a simple solution — because farmers are often the ones selling and buying land. Market factors drive sales. It’s basic capitalism.

Or maybe in this case, it’s a consequence of America’s free market.

Increasing energy needs

Row crop farmers have long championed renewable energy. But as emerging technologies like electric vehicles, clean HVAC systems, artificial intelligence and crypto drive unprecedented energy needs, some feel agriculture is being overlooked.

Matt Riggs, a fifth-generation Illinois corn and soybean farmer, is worried about farmland loss. Without the ability to stop commercial solar development, he supports dual-use agrivoltaics arrays, which can simultaneously produce energy and support agriculture.

“Projects are happening in my home county. There are no crops being grown underneath,” he said at the Solar Farm Summit conference in Chicago. “There is angst in the ag community. [Impacted] farmers are often multigenerational farmers who have been on the land for a long, long time.”

Fourth-generation Oregon farmer John Langdon, who likewise advocates for dual-use solar development when it’s inevitable, takes land preservation a step further.

“What does the future look like for ag? You talk about trends. One of the things I look at is the next generation,” he said at the same event. “I hear, ‘Save farmland.’ I’m interested in saving the farmer.”

Expansion correlates to expected demand. Even while rolling back solar-friendly policies, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted a 50% increase in electricity generation nationwide by 2050 in its annual Energy Outlook 2025.

Meanwhile, the U.S. grid is severely outdated. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory proposed dramatic grid expansion in a recent study — potentially doubling its size.

“Solar now accounts for about 5% of electricity generation,” said Pete Riley, a retired Farm Service Agency economic and policy analyst, speaking at the USDA’s 2025 Farm Outlook Forum in Washington, D.C. “Obviously, there is a lot of policy uncertainty at this stage. However, we will see continued expansion in the next couple years.”

DOE projects solar power generation will eclipse 40% of the nation’s electricity supply in the next decade. Two years ago, analysts valued the U.S. solar market at $53 billion. It’s expected to triple by 2032.

In part, that’s because arrays are easy to build and comparatively cheap.

“All electrons are valued,” said Matt Beasley, chief communications officer at Nashville-based Silicon Ranch. “The ones that should be valued the most are those that come to market the fastest. Over the past decade, solar has proven to be the lowest-cost form of new electricity generation and the quickest to deploy.”

Unlike fossil fuels from coal mines, rural lands have become the infrastructural landing zone for this energy expansion because farmland is inexpensive and already clearcut. For farmers, navigating this evolution sometimes means supporting the lesser of two evils.

“I’d rather see a solar farm than houses. Traffic is bad enough without adding 600 acres of residential neighborhoods,” said Dusty Smith, a young Cardington, Ohio, corn and soybean farmer with a small livestock operation. Even so, he said development often isn’t good for agriculture.

This challenge extends from Massachusetts, where ag real estate averages $14,400 per acre, to Texas, at about $2,800 per acre, and everywhere in between. Locally, Ohio’s demand is expected to quadruple from 500 to 2,000 megawatts in Delaware and Licking counties by 2027. Infrastructure is being built quickly to meet those needs.

“From 2008 to 2018, we were seeing a lot of wind projects come into Ohio,” said Matt Butler, public information officer for the Ohio Power Siting Board, which oversees utility-scale power. “Then the wind projects started to die down, and we saw more solar projects. Solar is kind of slowing, and we’re beginning to see a lot of behind-the-meter gas projects” to power data centers.

Solar’s effect on farming

Solar expansion’s impact on U.S. farmers is complex. Some landowners are selling or leasing at price points beyond their property’s agricultural production value. Renters face a more challenging situation. Although rent tends to remain stable, the land they cultivate — often improved through their own efforts — is being sold out from under them.

Meanwhile, landowners who offer land for solar face legal and tax pitfalls if they don’t adequately protect themselves. Neighbor farmers who aren’t involved in solar-related agreements face tangential risks like physical damage to existing agricultural infrastructure or increased traffic.

Smith opened a map on his iPhone and zoomed in to where a proposed 600-acre Open Road Renewables solar farm abuts his productive land. It’s worrying because drainage runs through the planned development. He’s afraid it will harm floodwater mitigation.

“We have a main tile going through a part of the field,” he explained. “Dad and I have very much been upfront: ‘Hey, look. We have major concerns. This is part of our operation. This is our livelihood. Are you going to take care of us? What’s going to happen?’

“That’s a 90-acre field with no outlet,” he said. “If they cut it, that’s swamp ground.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt00b41504fd79f933/695feacbca52e0db44f237df/0112T1-5640a-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-13 15:12:41.777772

That’s the crux of “Anthropause: The Beauty of Degrowth,” a new book out this month.

In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, society shut down for a few months. As humans stayed inside, animals returned to their old habitats and pollution eased as industry slowed.

Retired researcher—and new metro Detroit resident—Stan Cox looks at how that “anthropause” could be a preview of the necessary societal changes to save lives and the planet.

He spoke with All Things Considered – Detroit host Russ McNamara last month. Click on the media player to listen or read selected transcripts below.

Russ McNamara, WDET: Why did you write this book?

Stan Cox, Author: The main point I’m making in the book is imagining that we as a society, if we were to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and get by just on the energy that could be generated other ways; and if we stopped plundering the earth for minerals and cutting down forest and causing ecological damage; and we had less energy and materials, and had to allocate them carefully: people know that’s going to mean sacrifice. What am I going to have to give up and so forth?

And what I’m saying in the book is okay, yeah, there are certain things, obviously that will have to be given up. But let’s consider all of the dangers and nuisances, terrible stuff that we put up with an advanced industrial society that has all this energy and materials running through it.

We would be saying goodbye to a lot of those harms and ills by simply not doing a lot of the stuff that requires so much energy input. So the rest of the book, then, is going through specific technologies and activities and so forth that are really harmful to people and the environment, of course, that we would not have the fuel to undertake them, or we would be using resources for meeting people’s basic needs, and we wouldn’t be spending a lot of energy on these other things.

RM: You discuss this and I’m reminded of data centers to run artificial intelligence. People certainly don’t seem to want them and definitely don’t want these in their backyard because there is this concern about the high cost of electricity, and the amount of groundwater that is needed.

SC: That’s absolutely right. One of the big reasons these communities don’t want them is that they create this horrific noise at very high decibel levels and low low frequency noise, which is especially dangerous to human health. When I started writing the book, there wasn’t as much being said about A.I. and the data centers at that time, so I did eventually incorporated them, but the beginning of the second chapter is about noise pollution and and I just used it. It’s seemingly a very small thing, but it really brings out other issues. The leaf blower, especially the gas powered leaf blower, also produces this low frequency and very high volume sound—about eight times the decibel level that the World Health Organization says is safe – and they’re producing a wind about the speed of an EF five tornado. The low frequency sound can travel like three football fields. It’s still above the safe limit.

RM: So what are the societal impacts? Let’s say we start degrowth right now. What are the benefits?

SC: We can’t go on like we’re on the trajectory that we’re on now, because. A degrowth is going to happen. Either a chaotic, brutal degrowth where it’s a Mad Max kind of future, because we’ve tried to force growth to continue and have destroyed ecosystems

Or we can have a planned, rational degrowth that ensures that there’s enough for everybody and that we’re not causing ecological collapse. But there’s no way that growth can continue at this rate.

Sometime in the past three years, we passed a milestone. The quantity of human made stuff—that is everything that human society has manufactured or built or produced—if you weigh all of it up, the mass of all of that exceeds the total mass of all living things on Earth, all plants, animals, microbes, et cetera, and that quantity of stuff being produced is is doubling every 20 years. And clearly that can’t go on.",https://wdet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AnthropauseBook.png,N,,2026-01-13 16:00:08.981177

President calls for global finance shift for developing nations

LAGOS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Nigeria is betting on green finance to drive its energy transition with the president unveiling plans for a $2 billion climate fund on Tuesday, saying oversubscribed green bonds were proof of investor appetite.

Speaking at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week summit, President Bola Tinubu said Nigeria’s Climate Investment Platform aimed to mobilise $500 million for climate-resilient infrastructure, while the National Climate Change Fund is targeting a $2 billion capitalisation to back projects that cut emissions and boost resilience.

Tinubu also announced that Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates had signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that aims to boost trade and investment across sectors including renewable energy, aviation, logistics, agriculture, digital trade, and climate-smart infrastructure.

Nigeria faces major environmental and climate policy challenges including reducing gas flaring and methane emissions, as it works towards its Energy Transition Plan, which targets net-zero emissions by 2060 while delivering universal energy access.

Nigeria’s green bond programme has drawn strong investor interest. A 50 billion naira ($38 million) sovereign green bond issued in 2025 attracted 91 billion naira in subscriptions, while Lagos State’s green bond was oversubscribed by nearly 98%, the president said.

Tinubu said his government was also seeking to unlock an ambitious $25–$30 billion annually in climate finance. A new Climate and Green Industrialisation Investment Playbook will aid private investors and other stakeholders navigate manufacturing policy and the regulatory landscape.

This builds on past initiatives including the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority's $500 million Distributed Renewable Energy Fund, launched in March 2025 to catalyse local financing.

“These reforms show Nigeria is ready for business,” the president said, adding that non-oil exports have grown by 21% and investment commitments now exceed $50 billion across key sectors.

Nigeria is prioritising technology partnerships to modernise its grid and deploy artificial intelligence for efficiency, alongside pilot projects in electric mobility and green industrialisation, he added.

The president called for a shift towards more blended finance -- which combines public and philanthropic capital with private investment and can absorb initial losses if the project underperforms -- instead of sovereign guarantees, which he said unfairly penalise emerging economies.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposed rule that would return Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 to its proper statutory purpose, protecting water quality while eliminating regulatory overreach that has imposed unnecessary burden on critical infrastructure projects. This proposed rule would fulfill EPA's statutory role to ensure the water quality certification process operates within the clear boundaries established by Congress, maximizing permitting efficiency and eliminating unwarranted delays that have stifled economic growth. The changes directly support the essential role that state co-regulators and authorized tribes play in protecting water resources while advancing the Trump Administration's commitment to cooperative federalism.

This action would correct a fundamentally flawed 2023 Biden EPA rule that allowed delay tactics and protracted certification timelines inconsistent with the Clean Water Act. The 2023 rule's expansion of Section 401's scope enabled certain states to abuse this provision, creating substantial regulatory burdens that unnecessarily delayed or blocked vital energy, infrastructure, and development projects critical to America's economic and national security. The Trump EPA's proposal would eliminate these regulatory hurdles, restoring the law to its intended function while removing impediments to responsible development.

“Today’s proposal restores the Clean Water Act to its intended purpose, protecting America’s water quality and ending the weaponization of the law that has been obstructing infrastructure and energy projects vital to our nation’s economy,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “By returning Section 401 to its clear statutory boundaries, we’re strengthening the role of state and tribal partners while ensuring environmental protections are implemented lawfully, efficiently, and consistent with congressional intent.”

“The EPA’s new rule aligns with my longstanding legislative efforts to update the Section 401 certification process to streamline infrastructure development. The EPA’s update reverses costly Biden-era policies that allowed states to weaponize Section 401 to block infrastructure projects for reasons unrelated to water quality. I commend Administrator Zeldin’s work to expedite critical infrastructure development and help America build faster,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

“I commend Administrator Zeldin for bringing common sense back to the Clean Water Act section 401 process and ensuring the Act’s focus is on clean water – not on weaponizing it to block infrastructure projects for reasons that have nothing to do with clean water. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is pursuing this same goal through the PERMIT Act, which we passed out of the House in December, and I look forward to both the rule and the PERMIT Act moving forward,” said House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO-06).

In response to implementation challenges with the flawed 2023 Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification rule, the Trump EPA took swift action in the spring of 2025, issuing a memo that clarified the specific roles of states and authorized tribes under Clean Water Act Section 401. The agency also sought public input this summer to inform the updates being proposed in this action.

The proposed rulemaking would ensure predictability in Clean Water Act Section 401 implementation by standardizing approaches for certification requests and decisions, eliminating back-and-forth delay tactics on certification submissions, adhering to statutory timelines for certification decisions, and defining a clear process for both applicants and certifying authorities.

Additionally, the proposed rule would ensure that states and tribes are no longer able to use Section 401 to shut down projects for reasons that fall outside of the Clean Water Act’s statutory requirements and appropriate and applicable water quality-related regulations.

Following the proposed rule’s publication in the Federal Register, EPA will open a 30-day public comment period. The agency will quickly review comments received as it works to develop a final rule in the spring of 2026.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 15:01:17.475057

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and some other Republican leaders in Congress are bullish on the prospect of advancing a sequel to last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, even as President Donald Trump and some other key players have thrown cold water on the idea.

“It would be political malpractice if we did not pursue a reconciliation 2.0 plan,” Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), chair of the Republican Study Committee, told reporters Tuesday.

“There’s no reason to stop our progress right now,” Pfluger added. “We have momentum on our side, and there’s more work to be done.”

The framework includes several dozen bullet points, not legislative text, so the exact nature of some of the proposals is not completely clear. The extent of some of the proposals’ budget impacts — a requirement for inclusion in a reconciliation law — is also unclear.

Republicans want to try again to pass a version of the “REINS Act” through reconciliation. The legislation, a conservative priority, would restrict an administration’s ability to implement major rules without Congress’ approval.

Under the heading “Energy Independence and Economic Security for All Americans,” the RSC included multiple proposals to ease permitting-related obstacles for energy and infrastructure projects.

One would establish a program called “Keeping the American Promise” that would “provide economic protection” against future administrations canceling approved permits, licenses and investments for fossil fuel projects. The framework does not mention renewables or energy sources with broad bipartisan support, such as nuclear and geothermal.

Another proposal would impose “royalty-style fees” on plaintiffs suing the federal government for alleged violations of “procedural environmental laws.” The fees’ revenues would go toward the Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.

Republicans included a plan to establish categorical exclusions — presumably under the National Environmental Policy Act — for “forest management-related activities.” The goal would be “protecting natural resources and promoting effective wildfire management,” according to the framework.

The framework also includes a proposal to impose a fee on states’ applications for waivers that would allow them to set more stringent pollution limits than those imposed by the Clean Air Act.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/36/20/a0fa00a8446abc255149acb38849/u-s-congress-92081.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 15:01:22.213350

GM had a record year for EV sales in 2025, tapering off in the fourth quarter due to the end of the tax credits.

The automaker may bring back hybrids in the future.

General Motors had to make several difficult decisions last year. After the Trump administration axed the $7,500 federal tax credit and heavily revised fuel-economy rules to end the push for a mostly-electric market by the 2030s, the automaker scaled back its battery-powered ambitions.

The Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan, which was earmarked for EV-only production, will now produce gasoline trucks. GM also sold its stake in the Ultium Cells battery plant to LG Energy Solution, due to potentially less demand for EV batteries amid slowing sales.

“It will take longer without the incentives, but I still think we’ll get there over time,” Barra told Reuters reporter and APA President Kalea Hall, referring to the cooling period for EV sales after the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit last September.

“Once someone buys an EV, they're 80% more likely to buy another EV,” Barra said. “Our destination is to get to the all-EV future we've been talking about,"" she added.

Barra's optimistic remarks came just a day before President Donald Trump’s visit to Michigan to speak at the Detroit Economic Club and visit Ford’s Dearborn Assembly plant, where the F-150 pickups are made. Whether the president will address EVs in his talk was not immediately clear, but the Trump administration's regulatory reset has been costly for the American auto industry.

Just last week, GM disclosed in an SEC filing that pumping the brakes on EVs resulted in $6 billion in associated charges in the final quarter of the year due to things like contract cancellation fees for suppliers.

Ford also faced a similar outcome, although on a much larger scale, booking over $19 billion in charges for dialling down its EV ambitions, which included ending production of the F-150 Lightning.

And Stellantis said last week that it was canceling its plug-in hybrids in North America, with the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, and Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid all getting discontinued. That’s despite the Jeeps being the top-selling PHEVs of 2025, as per research firm Recurrent.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what will be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, referring to a potential recovery in EV sales in the years to come.

Apart from the Corvette E-Ray, GM does not sell any hybrids or PHEVs in the U.S. currently. But that could change in the future, Automotive News reported. “We have plans to do those, and we’ll have hybrids where we think we need to,” Barra said.

“But again, we’re mainly investing and continuing to work on EVs because we think that’s the end game,” she said.

Margaret Walls: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I’m your host, Margaret Walls. My guest today is Benji Backer.

Benji is the founder and CEO of Nature is Nonpartisan, which is a nonprofit organization that’s focused on redefining the environment as a nonpartisan issue. He also serves on the board of the American Conservation Coalition, or ACC, which is a conservative environmental organization that he founded—during his freshman year of college, mind you. I’m not sure what all of you were doing your freshman year of college, but I was not doing that!

Benji is also the author of a really interesting book that was published in 2024 entitled The Conservative Environmentalist: Common Sense Solutions for a Sustainable Future. He’s been named a New York Times changemaker and awarded the Fortune 40 under 40, Forbes 30 under 30, and various other awards, as well. Benji is really one of the leading youth environmental voices in the country, and he’s been said to be someone who has the ear of the Trump administration on conservation and environment issues.

We’re going to talk with Benji about what it means to be a conservative environmentalist, Nature Is Nonpartisan and the organization’s goals and priorities, his views on climate change, his engagement with the administration and Congress, and much more. Stay with us.

Hello, Benji. Welcome to Resources Radio. Thanks so much for coming on the show.

Benji Backer: It’s absolutely great to be here. Thanks for having me.

Margaret Walls: Benji, we always start the show with the “get-to-know-you question.” I just want to learn a little bit more about you and want our listeners to learn a little bit more about you. How did you come to be passionate about environmental issues? And how did you have the courage, I guess, to jump into this—what I would call a new brand of environmental advocacy—and do it at such a young age? Just tell us a little bit about how you got into what you’re doing.

Benji Backer: Well, I appreciate the question. It really honestly comes from genuine passion. Most people ask me that question about how I got active in politics and environmental activism at such a young age, and I really don’t have a clear answer other than the fact that I cared a lot at a young age.

My parents were not active politically. They cared a lot about conservation in the environment, but they weren’t also active environmentally either. It just was something that really was important to me.

In elementary school, every single time that we had the chance to do a project, (which, of course, was like an art project or something visual), I always would do it around the environment and environmental issues. I learned about climate change in grade school, and it was very important to me from that age.

At around the same time, probably, as I was learning about climate change in the latter end of grade school, I was also watching the 2008 presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama. The democratic process, as it was back then—I think it’s very, very toxic, compared to then, today—really inspired me to be active.

I have a grandpa who’s a Marine veteran, and John McCain reminded me of him. I love my grandpa, and I also believed in the values that John McCain was espousing. I was 10 years old, but my parents were start-up founders. Seeing how hard they worked for our family—and for the community that they helped employ people in—I think his values, just from a physical perspective, resonated with me. I asked my parents if I could volunteer for him. I was injured at the time, physically, so I couldn’t do the sports that I wanted to do.

Fast-forward 15 years from then, and I’ve combined both of those passions of politics (which was strange at the time) and environmentalism (which was, also, a little bit strange at the time), and continued learning, becoming more passionate, and becoming more worried—but more optimistic, at the same time, which we can get into at some point.

Margaret Walls: Yeah, we’ll investigate that more. That’s great. It’s really interesting. So, Benji, I first learned about your work earlier this year when the idea of selling federal lands was part of the budget reconciliation bill. Let me just remind listeners, or tell listeners if they didn’t know this, that some members of Congress offered up various versions of a bill that would’ve sold US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands—or, in some versions, it was both BLM lands and the US Forest Service lands.

This was ostensibly, I would say, to be used for housing development around Western communities that had some housing affordability challenges, and so forth. Ultimately, the idea failed, and I believe that you were one of the most prominent opponents of that. There were some others, but talk about that if you would—that one policy issue that was going on, where you stood on it, and what role you played.

Benji Backer: Well, it’s been a difficult first year of the administration, because there’s been so many things that have happened every single day. When I launched this organization, Nature Is Nonpartisan, early in 2025, we got an onslaught of, “Are you commenting on this? Are you commenting on that? Are you pushing back against this, and pushing back against that?” You can’t do it all. But when I saw this come across the radar—I actually had a congressman flag it for me before it went public—that this land sale was going to be in the reconciliation bill (the Big Beautiful Bill is what the president called it), I became incredibly, incredibly alarmed.

Going back to my story: Public lands are the reason I care about the environment in the first place. It’s the reason I care about climate change in the first place. I spent most of my childhood in national forests, which was what was on the chopping block here. Then, almost all of my college experience—I grew up in Wisconsin and moved out to Seattle for college—when I wasn’t working and running the nonprofit that I founded, I was out skiing and hiking in national forests.

When the proposal was to sell off national forests—it was three million acres of unidentified land. No one knew what parcels,, and could have literally been anywhere that was a national forest or BLM land—I decided that this was something, early on in the organization, that we had to take on. Again, we couldn’t take on everything—let alone, really, anything—because of how new we were. But I knew that this was a hill I was willing to die on.

I remember it was a Monday morning before it was announced, and I tweeted out, “Hey, there’s going to be this public land sell-off, and it’s three million acres, and here are some pictures of me in those places that could be sold off. They are fully eligible with the language of the bill.” And it went viral. It was crazy to see the reaction. The reason why being viral, in this case, mattered was twofold: One, it was all across the spectrum. You had the furthest Left and the furthest Right, and the center-Left and the center-Right, all uniting around opposition for this, in the midst of the most divisive time in my lifetime, honestly. And seeing that happen, during this divisive moment, was really powerful.

The second thing was: Eventually, the senator who introduced it, Mike Lee, caved. The reason he caved was not due to a technicality, which is what it was blamed on—there was some technicality through Senate rules that was, supposedly, not allowing this policy to go through. It was actually because so many senators across the political spectrum were against it, including those of his own party. And the reason they were against it was because the general public, across the spectrum, was also against it. It was really a showcase of the power of grassroots, and really a showcase of the power of culture, because it was social media and cultural figures.

I was the first one, I think, to sound the alarm nationally, but then I became drowned out by all these huge voices, in a good way. People like Joe Rogan, Patagonia, REI, and everyone in between were voicing opposition against this. I think that’s the future of environmentalism that I see. It’s one that, yes, we don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things, but there’s a few things that our Venn diagrams do overlay on: Clean air, clean water, protection of our wild spaces, protection of the places that we recreate, and restoration of the natural world around us. These are things that every American wants. And for the first time in a decade, this pretty bad idea, actually, had a really big silver lining, which is that it showed the power of working across the aisle on conservation again.

Margaret Walls: That’s interesting. Benji, I went to your event that you hosted on the Hill, which announced the Stewardship—Is that what they’re calling themselves? The Stewardship Conference?

Benji Backer: Yeah, Stewardship Conference.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. So, since you’re bringing up how it brought people and senators together, maybe just tell our listeners a little bit about that and what their effort is going to be with that.

Benji Backer: It was really interesting. Earlier this year—and thanks for attending that—I realized that there was really no domestic conservation caucus in the Senate. The reason that matters, for those who don’t know what a caucus is, is that there’s really no convening group for senators who care a lot about just general conservation, public land, water, and forest issues. I knew that earlier this year, and I was like, “Okay, that has to be started, but I’ll do that later. I’ll do that a couple of years from now, or something.” Then, when this public land sell-off was proposed, it unearthed the fact that there were all these senators on the Right and the Left—but, of course, helpful to know the senators on the Right—who were willing to say, “Hey, no, this is too far. I care a lot about conservation, and I’m willing to die on this hill, too.”

In the weeks following the defeat of this proposed bill, I talked to a few of the Republicans who had stood up against it, and they’re like, “Yeah, we need to have a convening mechanism to not just oppose bad things—because that’s only so helpful—but actually to propose good ideas, and get bipartisan policies across the finish line.”

So, we worked with Senator Heinrich and Senator Sheehy—who are two of my favorite lawmakers in this current moment—who were willing to put partisan politics aside and, during the historic-length government shutdown (as partisan as it gets), were willing to launch an eight-senator (four Republican and four Democrat) caucus to help promote conservation in the United States across party lines. We’re beginning to work on many bipartisan bills that have either already been introduced and just need to be accelerated, or new ones, to protect our forests, to protect our air, to protect our water, and to protect our public lands.

Margaret Walls: That’s great. Also, I’m not sure if this is related to what you have to say about this, but the president signed an executive order establishing the president’s Make America Beautiful Again Commission. I did read that you had something to do with that, as well, Benji. I don’t know if there’s anything going on with that. What the executive order says is that it’s tasked with developing options for improving conservation, recovering fish and wildlife populations, improving water quality, and increasing access to public lands and outdoor recreation. Do you know much about this and what’s going on with it? Is there activity around this? Tell us about that.

Benji Backer: Yeah. So, when the president won in 2024, I was in the midst of starting to launch my organization. We were trying to position ourselves so that no matter who won, we could make a difference. That’s, again, the future of environmentalism that I want to have, which is that it doesn’t matter who’s in office—things are happening that are good for conservation and good for the environment. We might not have voted for somebody, but we can put that aside and work toward a greater goal. At the end of the day, nature doesn’t really care who’s in office. Our environment needs to be protected and conserved in either situation.

When President Trump won, we started working with his cabinet on the Make America Beautiful Again executive order and commission—which is tasked to come up with policies through the US Department of the Interior, US Department of Agriculture, and other related agencies—for the president to have a conservation platform and policy agenda for good things for our public lands and private lands. There has not been a lot of progress on that yet, admittedly, and there’s three years left to this administration, so we’re going to keep pushing for durable conservation policy.

We have been waiting and pushing hard to make sure that things happen, but one of the things that’s really powerful about this Senate caucus is that there’s almost more momentum in the Senate than anywhere else right now to build this bipartisan consensus. Our goal as an organization is to work on culture and policy; to move the public narrative; to show leaders that there’s bipartisan, and nonpartisan, buy-in for conservation; and to push the policymakers. We’re going to go wherever the juice is going to be worth the squeeze. So, we have the commission and the White House agenda that we are ready to act on whenever they’re ready, and whenever they want us to work with them. Until that happens, we’re going to be focusing on the Senate and the cultural push.

That’s all to say, we did help get that together, and we will be helpful anytime that there’s going to be positive conservation action. So far, it’s been a secondary priority, and I think that’s also a symptom of a larger problem—which is that, for most Americans, the environment is not a top-five issue, and leaders do not feel like they will be held accountable if they don’t work across party lines to do good things for the environment. That’s an incentive we have to change, because President Trump, and any other president that doesn’t act on conservation going forward, should be held accountable. Also, they should want to do good things because they feel like they’re going to get rewarded. What I would rather have is not this negative accountability, but this positive accountability. Right now, there isn’t that.

I will say, as much as President Trump has not done a lot on conservation, if he changed on a dime tomorrow and said, “Hey, we’re going to do some great things in conservation across the party lines,” there are a lot of groups who would not give him the credit for it—they don’t want to give President Trump the credit, because he’s somebody that they don’t like.

We have to get past this political baseball that we’ve played on the issue and provide an incentive for someone like President Trump to act on it. We’re going to keep pushing as hard as we can while we’re building up that grassroots movement that America needs, across party lines, for this issue.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. I’m going to come back to some of your priority-setting, but I want to ask you first about climate change, Benji.

I know that you feel that climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, but you’re not a fan of some of the ways that we have tackled this problem. And I know that you have concerns about the messaging and communication around it, which, I think, you feel has alienated people. Can you talk about all that a little bit? Where do you come out on this issue, and what do you think have been some of the problems? Then, we’ll talk about some of the solutions.

Benji Backer: Look, as I mentioned in my opening, climate change has been a deep passion of mine since I was a kid. Growing up in Wisconsin, I know climate change is real, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes. I’ve seen snow days become less and less common in Wisconsin where I grew up, and white Christmases are not the constant that they once were when I was growing up. Those are the sorts of things that are just undeniable.

However, the fear mongering of saying that the world’s going to end, and that we’re going to not have snow by 2000, and then we’re not going to have snow by 2020, and then we need to go a hundred percent this or a hundred percent that by 2030, otherwise the planet’s going to burn—those sorts of predictions and, honestly, unscientific claims (because even the scientists have been frustrated with the overdramatization of climate change) have really frustrated me. It’s made our job harder, it’s made it more political, and it’s made it more difficult to get good things done.

Most Americans who don’t believe in climate change care deeply about the environment. They just don’t like to be told that the world’s going to end and then have it not happen. They also don’t like the solutions that have been proposed, which have been very one-sided and, honestly, benefit certain people and really hurt others.

So, two things are true. Climate change and human-caused climate change is absolutely real, and we need to do something about it. I always will say that, and that is something that, honestly, every American should believe. But I can understand why they don’t, because what also is true is that it has been overpoliticized, overdramatized, and overextended to the point where if you don’t care about this, you’re evil. If you don’t switch your car to electric, you’re evil. If you don’t believe that we should just ban fossil fuels, you’re evil. If you even try to work in the energy industry, you’re evil. And there’s just been a lot of villainization and overdramatization.

The way forward, I think, is to reconnect people back to the land that they love. What I’ve heard a lot, recently, is this idea of “patriotism of place.” People don’t care, necessarily, about something thousands of miles away. They don’t care about the polar bears, but they also don’t care about sea level rise if they live in Arizona. If you can hear it in the background, it’s thundering—it’s one of the rare rainstorms in Arizona. People here care about what’s coming down right now—this rain that doesn’t happen as often as it needs to in Arizona. People in Florida don’t really care about the drought in Arizona. So, can you start to rally people for pro-climate solutions in a way that’s relevant to their own day-to-day lives?

I think the best way to do that is to do it with nature-based solutions. Of course, we need to transition to clean energy sources and transportation over time. Honestly, it’s more about efficiency than clean [energy]. It’s like, How can we make people’s lives easier, better, and more productive, so that they can spend more time with their family and more money on putting food on the table? Those are the sorts of things that we need to transition to.

To get people connected to the issue again, instead of thinking about it from a political lens, we should be thinking about it from an environmental lens. I care about climate change, not because I care that much about polar bears, but because I care a lot about the environment that I love hiking and recreating in. And that’s the conversation that we need to have around climate change if we’re going to build the political coalition needed to get the policies that we also need.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. I know in the book you talk a bit about empowering local communities, and you talk about both sides of this. So, communities that are fossil fuel communities that feel beat up over the issues—like they’re the problem—but also that local communities are part of the solution. Maybe just say a little bit more about that. What I took away from that part of the book was that people have different things to bring to the table based on where they live. It’s all about—well, I like what you just said—“patriotism of place.” Is that the term you used? I haven’t heard that before, but anyway, can you just talk about that?

Benji Backer: Absolutely. You look at a Tribal leader, or you look at a farmer, or you look at a rancher. These are people who maybe don’t know how to take care of a place near New York City or thousands of miles away, but they sure as heck know how to take care of their backyard. They know how to do that better than anybody else.

And Tribal leaders are a perfect example of this. For generations, they have been the best stewards of their land imaginable. They managed forest fires, they knew how to cultivate the land for resources without destroying it, and they knew how to rely on the land while also conserving it.

Honestly, it’s the same approach that a lot of America’s farmers and ranchers use where they have to have the health of the environment to have the health of their family and the health of their community. That is a very different approach than somebody who doesn’t have that background and isn’t living in those communities, but is maybe telling them what to do or how to live their lives.

When you look at a to-do list, every day when you wake up, there’s a lot of things to do on it. When you look at the to-do list for climate change, there’s a lot of things on it, and we’re not going to do it all at once. So, we might as well solve it community by community, and locality by locality, because that’s actually the fastest way to do it over time. Look at, again, where the majority of the action has actually come from for fighting climate change, and just seeing environmental progress in general. It hasn’t really come from wide-sweeping efforts as much as it has from a collective progress made by all these different communities combined.

You look at the energy transition, and some of the emissions that have been reduced since the early 2000s in the United States—it wasn’t because of a massive mandate. Actually, at the time, it was states like Iowa—there’s a lot of wind, so they put up a lot of windmills. It’s that local solution that depends on your geography, it depends on your income, and it depends on what job you have. And finding a way to strike more of a balance when it comes to the policy—where it’s not just top down, but a mixture of top down, bottom up, and corporate—that’s the future.

That’s not to say that it’s just corporate, or it’s just bottom up. Of course, there needs to be federal investments made and standards met. But when the default is always top down, you lose that localization that is so powerful. The justification for it is, “If we don’t do this, we’re not going to act fast enough.” But when we’re only doing top down, you get this political back and forth of, “This is too far. We’re going to sue. We’re going to revoke it. We’re going to undo it.” And then you end up not making any progress. Imagine if you were battling that out while you were also really incentivizing the local solutions. I think that’s where a lot of the power is going to come from.

Margaret Walls: That’s an interesting point. I’m going to turn back to your organization, Nature Is Nonpartisan. You mentioned this earlier, and you mentioned it when we talked before, about [how] you’re stretched thin and you don’t have the bandwidth to cover every single environmental issue. I’m interested in where things stand now. What are some of the challenges you face on how to focus and prioritize? And what are you coming to as some of the main issue areas that you’re going to work on in the near future—like, over the next year, let’s say?

Benji Backer: Yeah. Soon, we’re going to be launching United by Nature, which is going to be our national initiative to bring the coalition of organizations and the general population toward environmental progress in this country, and really try to make it part of the American ethos again. Within that initiative, we’re going to have a few core issues: the conservation of public lands, making sure that every American has clean drinking water, making sure that we are restoring wildlife and ecosystems, disaster proofing communities, and restoring forests so that we don’t have megafires. Those are going to be the core issues. It sounds like a lot, but we’re going to be tackling them bite by bite.

The first campaign we’re going to launch is around public lands, because, right now, there are a bunch of really important initiatives that we need to get done and that Americans really want, which is funding of our national park system, better maintenance of our national forests and public lands, and making sure that we can actually maintain them—there’s a huge backlog of funding for that maintenance. So, helping rally Americans around their love of public lands—again, not just to oppose something, but to get something across the finish line as our first campaign.

The second one will be about clean drinking water. 94 percent of Americans drink water with microplastics in it. There’s a really big problem across the country, whether that be floods or droughts, toxic water because of the Salt Lake drying up, or toxic water because of microplastics. We have a water crisis in America, so we’re going to tackle that, as well. After that, we’ll start to add on some of these other issues.

But the core—and how we think about this—is, Where is there the most overlap politically? Where is there a winning coalition of Americans that we know is ready, but they maybe just haven’t been activated, or [don’t] know how to be activated, yet? Also, where is the most urgent issue? In my opinion, and in our organization’s opinion, there’s a desperate need to better maintain our public spaces and lands to make sure that we can have healthy habitats and healthy places to recreate. And then also, that we have healthy water for our kids and our grandkids, and also for ourselves. So, that’s what we’re going to focus on first.

I would just say, this Trump-era environmentalism of pushing back against everything that is deemed “wrong,” I think has really made it difficult for the movement to focus on what they actually want to be for. When, every day, you wake up, and you think about, “Okay, what announcement do I need to be against today?” you’re not trying to prepare for the future. How do you build that coalition? If you think that that’s a problem—that’s a symptom of the problem. The fact that people think that they can get away with antienvironmental action is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that we don’t have a winning coalition to get things done yet on conservation. So, our goal is to figure out where that winning coalition is in terms of their priority, but then also where the most urgent priorities are from a conservation perspective.

Margaret Walls: That seems like, if you get some wins in some of these, then that lays the groundwork for others, doesn’t it?

Benji Backer: It sure does. That’s the diabolical master plan. Announcing it here on the show.

Yep, once you start building consensus on some things, you’re able to do it on others; we’ve seen that work in the past. Honestly, I used to think we could do it all at once, and that’s the impatient young person in me that wanted that to happen. But yeah, you’ve got to lay the groundwork, and that’s what we’re trying to do.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. Well, Benji, we’re getting near the end here, and we always close our podcast with a regular feature that we call Top of the Stack. I didn’t warn you about this, but I’m going to ask you to recommend to listeners a book, a podcast, a movie, an article, or any content that has caught your attention lately and that you would like to recommend to people. What’s on the top of your stack, Benji?

Benji Backer: Well, there is an amazing story about Teddy Roosevelt going down the Amazon River, or this very difficult river in the Amazon. I’m actually forgetting the name of it, because I read it a couple of months ago, but it was really an interesting book—if you look up “Teddy Roosevelt Amazon River,” you’ll find it—because it really showed how up and down Teddy Roosevelt’s life was. And when you think about environmental activism, there’s a lot of ups and downs—there are some really hard moments, and there are some really high moments. It’s, honestly, just trying to go in this upward trajectory that Teddy Roosevelt really embodied during his life.

The River of Doubt is actually what it’s called. It just came to me.

That’s how I think we need to embody environmental activism, is living by the Teddy Roosevelt life-spirit.

Margaret Walls: Great, I’m going to look for that book. That’s awesome.

Well, Benji, this has been a pleasure having you on Resources Radio, talking about public lands, climate change, and your new organization Nature Is Nonpartisan. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

Trump issued a series of executive orders invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on most U.S. trading partners (IEEPA tariffs). According to the government, importers had paid approximately $129 billion in estimated duty deposits for entries covered by most of the IEEPA tariffs as of December 10, 2025. Several importers and states have filed lawsuits challenging the President's authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA, and multiple courts have held that IEEPA does not authorize the challenged tariffs. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments to review those lower court decisions in November 2025.

This In Focus analyzes potential paths and obstacles for importers to obtain refunds of the IEEPA tariffs, as well as options for Congress, in the event that the Supreme Court holds that some or all of these tariffs are unlawful.

Background on Collection of Tariffs

There are generally two processes for the entry of goods into the United States and the collection of duties—formal (19 U.S.C. § 1484) and informal (19 U.S.C. § 1498).

Formal entry is required for goods with a value greater than $2,500. In general, the importer posts a bond with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and pays estimated duties on the merchandise. Later, the government makes a final ascertainment of the duties owed on those goods, known as ""liquidation."" Under 19 U.S.C. § 1504, liquidation must occur within one year of the entry of goods, although the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the period in certain circumstances. Per CBP's practice, liquidation typically occurs automatically 314 days after entry.

Informal entry uses simplified procedures and generally does not require the posting of a bond. Informal entries are generally considered to have been liquidated upon payment of estimated duties.

Potential Paths to Tariff Refunds

Liquidated Versus Unliquidated Entries

Because the first IEEPA tariffs took effect in February 2025, a significant percentage of imports affected by the IEEPA tariffs have not yet been liquidated. The government has stated that, as of December 10, 2025, approximately 19.2 million of the approximately 34 million entries subject to the IEEPA tariffs remained unliquidated. For unliquidated imports, the government may be required to issue refunds upon liquidation if the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful. The Secretary of the Treasury holds statutory authority to refund duties ""[w]henever it is ascertained on liquidation or reliquidation . . . that more money has been deposited or paid as duties than was required by law."" Customs regulations generally require refunds to be issued in such cases unless the discrepancy is less than $20. Customs regulations also acknowledge that refunds may be required following court-ordered reliquidation, a scenario discussed below.

Millions of informal entries subject to the IEEPA tariffs were considered liquidated at or near the date of their entry. Beginning in mid-December 2025 (314 days after the initial IEEPA tariffs took effect), many formal entries likely also began to be liquidated. Based on statutory authorization and limitations, current CBP regulations provide that CBP may voluntarily reliquidate an entry within 90 days of its original liquidation ""to correct errors in appraisement, classification, or any other element entering into the liquidation or reliquidation, including errors based on misconstruction of applicable law."" This authority may allow CBP to reliquidate and provide refunds for entries that were liquidated within the preceding 90 days. Once this deadline has passed—or if CBP does not use this voluntary reliquidation authority—importers may have other paths to seek refunds of any unlawful tariffs, as discussed below.

Protests for Liquidated Entries

One potential avenue for importers to seek refunds for already-liquidated entries is to file a formal protest with CBP. Under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(c)(3), an importer may file a protest of a decision of CBP within 180 days after the date of liquidation or, in some circumstances, the date on which the decision was made. Some law firms have advised importers to file protests pending the Supreme Court's decision in case the Court invalidates the IEEPA tariffs.

Under 19 U.S.C. § 1515(a), CBP must either ""deny"" or ""allow"" a protest ""in whole or in part."" If CBP allows the protest, ""any duties . . . found to have been assessed or collected in excess shall be remitted or refunded . . . ."" Section 1515 gives CBP up to two years to review a protest but allows a protester to request ""accelerated disposition."" If CBP does not decide the protest within 30 days of a request for accelerated disposition, the protest is ""deemed"" (considered to be) denied. CBP's denial of a protest allows the protester to seek judicial relief, as discussed below.

There may be some doubt as to whether CBP's collection of the IEEPA tariffs may be protested under Section 1514, since CBP collected these tariffs pursuant to executive orders issued by the President. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (which has exclusive jurisdiction to hear intermediate appeals of certain trade cases) has held that some ""purely ministerial"" actions taken by CBP are not protestable decisions under Section 1514. To be subject to protest, the court has held, CBP must make ""substantive determinations or undert[ake] . . . discretionary actions."" For example, the court has found that CBP's ministerial implementation of rate determinations made by the Commerce Department in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations was not subject to protest under Section 1514. One court decision held protesting CBP's collection of IEEPA tariffs to be futile because CBP lacks authority to assess the legality of the President's executive orders.

Uncertainty about Section 1514 protestability may cast doubt on the proper path to sue the government for refunds, as shown by an earlier set of court decisions. In its 1998 decision United States v. U.S. Shoe Co., the Supreme Court held that a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) enacted by Congress partly violated the Constitution's Export Clause, which bars taxation of U.S. exports. In some lawsuits, the Federal Circuit held that the collection of the HMT was not protestable, because ""Customs is powerless to perform any active role in the determination of the constitutionality of the [HMT]."" Thus, the court held that plaintiffs could sue the United States for refunds of the HMT without first exhausting the protest process. In another instance, the Federal Circuit held that the denial of an HMT refund request was a protestable decision, giving plaintiffs a separate avenue to seek judicial relief with a different statute of limitations but also an exhaustion requirement.

Lawsuits in the U.S. Court of International Trade

Importers who are otherwise unsuccessful in obtaining refunds may attempt to obtain relief by suing the United States in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT). The CIT is a specialized court with exclusive, nationwide jurisdiction over certain trade cases, including (1) civil actions commenced to contest the denial of a protest, under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a), and (2) other civil actions arising out of laws providing for revenue from imports and tariffs, duties, fees, and other taxes on importation, under 28U.S.C. § 1581(i) (so-called ""residual"" jurisdiction). Lawsuits seeking refunds of IEEPA tariffs could conceivably fall under either of these jurisdictional grants, depending on whether or not CBP's collection or retention of these tariffs is protestable under 19 U.S.C. § 1514, as discussed above. Under the statute of limitations (29 U.S.C. § 2636), lawsuits to contest the denial of a protest must be filed within 180 days after the denial, while lawsuits under the CIT's residual jurisdiction must be filed within two years ""after the cause of action first accrues""—potentially, the point in time when the tariffs were paid.

Some court decisions have held that the CIT may reliquidate entries to provide for refunds in Section 1581(i) cases, while others have raised doubts about the scope of this authority. In litigation challenging the IEEPA tariffs, the CIT has held that it has the authority to order reliquidation and that the government may not contest this authority given its assertion to the court that it will ""not oppose"" reliquidation or resulting refunds to plaintiffs if the Supreme Court holds that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful.

Potential Limits on Judicial Relief

The CIT generally has authority under 28 U.S.C. § 2643 to order money damages, injunctions, and any other ""appropriate"" relief. Yet it is uncertain whether the CIT has the power to order refunds for importers other than plaintiffs. Class action lawsuits may potentially provide a means for large numbers of importers to obtain tariff refunds without bringing individual lawsuits. The CIT's Rule 23 permits the claims of numerous individuals or entities to be aggregated into a single class action proceeding where a case meets the rule's requirements (concerning, e.g., the numerosity and commonality of the class), although past cases may cast doubt on whether class certification would be available for importers seeking IEEPA tariff refunds. In 1996, the CIT decided not to certify a class of persons who had paid the HMT, suggesting instead that ""Congress should decide whether to create a special procedure to refund small amounts to individuals who choose not to sue . . . ."" At least one class action lawsuit seeking refunds of IEEPA tariffs has been filed in the CIT, although that suit was voluntarily dismissed (withdrawn) before any substantive proceedings.

Under Supreme Court precedent, refunds might arguably be considered a form of equitable (i.e., injunctive) relief insofar as they seek ""to restore to the [importer] particular funds . . . in the [government's] possession."" This argument raises the question of whether the CIT could enter a so-called nationwide injunction ordering that refunds of IEEPA tariffs be paid to all importers, regardless of whether they are parties to a lawsuit. In June 2025, the Supreme Court held in Trump v. CASA, Inc. that federal courts may not issue injunctions that are broader than needed to provide complete relief to the parties. The Court left open the possibility that nationwide injunctions might sometimes meet this standard, and lower courts have found such injunctions to be needed to provide relief to state plaintiffs in some circumstances. CASA's implications for the CIT's ability to order tariff refunds for nonparties may be unclear, in part because states as well as private parties have filed lawsuits challenging the IEEPA tariffs. In 1998, the CIT ordered a streamlined claims resolution procedure to obtain HMT refunds, but this procedure was available only to plaintiffs who filed lawsuits in the CIT.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews.
They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act.","Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration's goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states' power. President Donald Trump's first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what's called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,"" said Jess Kramer, EPA's assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren't sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump's first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate"" the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government's power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars"" like restoring America's energy dominance — Trump's shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule interpreting Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that undercuts and states’ authority to protect their water quality. In response, Moneen Nasmith, Director of National Climate, Fossil Fuel Infrastructure at Earthjustice, released the statement below:

“From what we’ve seen so far, this effort by EPA is solving for a problem that doesn’t exist. States and tribes exercise the authority given to them by Congress in the Clean Water Act to review and reject projects that pose unacceptable threats to their waterways and wetlands. States and tribes that take that responsibility seriously are not abusing their authority, they are following the law.”

Background

To protect water quality, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act creates a state-tribal-federal partnership, giving individual states and some tribes the ability to review the impacts of federally licensed projects, like oil and gas pipelines, on waterways and wetlands within their borders.

Under the first Trump administration, EPA finalized a rule that significantly altered past interpretations of Section 401 and attempted to substantially limit states’ and tribes’ authority to review and potentially reject projects that would harm their waterways and health.

Earthjustice represented three tribes and two environmental organizations in a lawsuit against the Trump rollback, which made its way to the Supreme Court. In April 2022, the Supreme Court reinstated the Trump rule while the U.S. 9th Circuit of Appeals heard the case — a decision made without explanation and over the objection of four justices. The 9th Circuit later sided with the Supreme Court, overturning the district court’s decision to vacate the Trump rollback on procedural grounds and remanding back to the district court for further proceedings, which were stayed, pending EPA’s issuance of the final rule.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cuyahoga-river_getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 15:01:36.705537

“At a time when energy debates are often driven by competing narratives this report focuses on facts.","Notwithstanding low oil and gas prices and other challenges, the Texas energy industry came through big again in 2025 for cities, counties, schools, hospitals and other public concerns.

That’s according to the Texas Oil & Gas Association, which says in its annual Energy & Economic Impact Report that the industry paid $27 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties in fiscal 2025 — the second-highest total in state history.

“In Texas lasting progress is built on performance, not opinion,” TXOGA President Todd Staples said from Austin, crediting the Permian Basin for its key role. “Talk doesn’t grow jobs, keep homes warm or cars running.

“Action, investment and innovation drive greatness across the Texas economy. Even during a year dominated by market challenges, Texas oil and natural gas have proved once again to be the power behind Texas’ progress.”

Staples said the taxes translate to nearly $74 million every day for Texas’ public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. “Beyond this essential tax revenue Texas oil and natural gas deliver energy security at home and global stability for our allies,” he said. “Since 2007 when TXOGA first started compiling this data, the industry has paid more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in state and local taxes and state royalties, a figure that does not include the hundreds of billions in payroll for some of the highest-paying jobs in the state, taxes paid on office buildings and personal property and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.”

Staples said public education again got a major infusion from oil and natural gas royalties.

“The Permanent University Fund received $1.72 billion and the Permanent School Fund $1.4 billion,” he said. “Together the market value of these funds exceeds $100 billion.

“With a balance of $66.5 billion the Permanent School Fund alone is larger than Harvard’s endowment and is the largest educational endowment in the nation.”

He said the Texas Rainy Day or Economic Stabilization Fund has derived over $35.9 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes since its inception in 1987 with the ESF and State Highway Fund each garnering $2.7 billion last year.

“In FY 2025 Texas school districts received $2.6 billion in property taxes from mineral properties producing oil and natural gas, pipelines and gas utilities,” he said. “Counties received an additional $1 billion in these property taxes.”

Staples said the Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD ranked first statewide with $309.3 million in oil and natural gas property taxes while Reeves County ranked first among counties with $109.4 million.

“In FY 2025 the industry employed more than 495,500 Texans who earned an average of $133,095 — 68 percent more than the average paid to the rest of Texas’ private sector,” he said. “Conservatively these jobs generate approximately two more jobs with nearly 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy.

“Some economic analyses suggest that the industry’s employment multiplier could approach three additional jobs per direct job, bringing the total to over 2 million jobs supported by the industry across Texas.”

Despite market challenges, Staples said, the industry shattered another string of records.

“Non-stop innovation and investment and operational efficiency raised the bar for performance once again,” he said. “Texas crude oil production set a new record in July 2025, reaching 5.85 million barrels per day, and marketed natural gas production reached 35.4 bcf/d in August.

“Most of these impressive totals are coming out of the Permian Basin where innovation and efficiency are driving record production in the most important basin in the world.”

He said the state also set records for exports of crude oil and condensate, liquefied natural gas and total natural gas.

“To transport these volumes pipeline infrastructure grew to 472,790 miles and LNG export capacity from Texas and Louisiana approached 13 billion cubic feet per day with another 19 bcf/d of projects already being commissioned or under construction,” Staples said.

Addressing market commentary related to a potential global energy glut, Staples said, “Headlines aside our data show markets adjusting, not breaking.

“Texas energy remains productive, reliable and globally essential and fundamentals, not sentiment, continue to drive outcomes for our economy and consumers.”

He said TXOGA does not see evidence of a disorderly oversupply but rather markets adjusting as long-lead projects sanctioned years ago come online.

“As global energy demand continues to grow, U.S. production gains reflect productivity and efficiency and Texas remains uniquely resilient due to its infrastructure, export capacity and innovation,” Staples said. “These fundamentals, not short-term sentiment, underpin the strong economic contribution detailed in TXOGA’s 2025 Energy & Economic Impact Report.

“At a time when energy debates are often driven by competing narratives this report focuses on facts. It underscores a simple truth: Texas runs on oil and natural gas made possible by hundreds of thousands of skilled men and women who rise before the sun to keep our economy moving and our communities secure.

“In the coming year we look forward to continuing our partnership with state leaders and communities to keep Texas powered, prosperous and prepared for what comes next.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/020322_Winter-pumpjack-file.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:01:05.496960

[13] View Rule: EPA/OAR Proposed Revision to “Begin Actual Construction” in the New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Program, Office of Info.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has expressed its intent to propose a rule to revise the regulatory definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program, with a proposed rule expected in 2026.[1] The EPA has indicated that the rule, if proposed and finalized, will provide “flexibility” to developers to begin construction on ancillary structures that are not themselves components of the emitting structures, such as concrete pads and external walls, before obtaining the requisite air permit.[2]

CAA permit reform arrives at a time when energy demand, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) development, data center expansion, and electrification, is projected to surge over the next decade.[3] Against this backdrop, the EPA’s potential permitting reform aims to provide stakeholders with greater flexibility for early-stage site developments and accelerated project timelines.

Regulatory Background

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source of air pollutants cannot “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[4] EPA regulations define “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit,” which “include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.”[5]

For decades, the EPA interpreted this definition broadly. In a 1986 memorandum issued by then-EPA Director Edward Reich (the Reich memo), the agency adopted the position that the construction of structures “necessary to accommodate” emissions units could themselves constitute “actual construction” of emissions units and therefore trigger the need for an NSR permit.[6] The Reich memo effectively prohibited construction of structures that are not emission units — like footings, foundations, storage structures, and retaining walls — until developers obtained an NSR permit.

The result: often slower timelines and higher costs. Indeed, one study found that from 2002 to 2014, the average time to process an NSR permit was 420 days.[7] Of course, permitting timelines may vary depending on the type of project. For example, the same study found that natural gas permits on average were processed the fastest (319 days), whereas refinery project permits took the longest to assess (537 days).

In March 2020, however, the EPA issued draft guidance (the 2020 draft guidance) that adopted a less restrictive interpretation of the term “begin actual construction.”[8] Returning to the original regulatory text, the 2020 draft guidance confirmed that the only construction prohibited prior to issuance of an air permit is construction “on an emissions unit.” The EPA explained that its prior interpretations were “unnecessarily restrictive,” and that the revised interpretation “better conforms to the regulatory text” that defines “begin actual construction.”[9]

EPA Announces Permitting Reform

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed its 2020 guidance on the definition of “beginning actual construction” to provide “much needed clarity” and “flexibility,” motivated primarily by the global AI race.[10] EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that, “[f]or years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth” and identified “Permitting Reform” as a key pillar of the agency’s new “Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.”[11] A stated goal of CAA permit reform is to promote the development of data centers “critical to making the U.S. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital of the world.”[12] A proposed rule to further clarify the meaning of “beginning actual construction” is expected by January 2026, with a final rule targeted for September 2026.[13] Proponents hope the rule will accelerate project timelines.

The latest guidance from the EPA is found in a letter to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) regarding a proposed semiconductor facility in Phoenix, Arizona (the TSMC letter).[14] MCAQD sought guidance from the EPA on whether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, could begin construction on the “core and shell” of the semiconductor facility — i.e., foundation, steel superstructure, and external walls — prior to MCAQD’s issuance of an NSR permit. TSMC agreed to defer the installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that could be classified as emissions units, foundations for such units, and piping until after the issuance of a permit.

The EPA referred back to its 2020 draft guidance and concluded that TSMC could proceed with the initial phase of construction because the structures to be built were not specifically configured for emissions units and therefore did not constitute “begin[ning] actual construction.”[15] But the EPA cautioned that any construction activities undertaken prior to issuance of an NSR permit would be at the developer’s “own risk” and that the developer’s “time and resources expended on construction prior to obtaining a permit” may not be used as justification to grant the air permit.[16] And until the EPA officially proposes and finalizes a rule, the EPA stated that it may advise on “begin actual construction” questions on a “case-by-case basis.”[17]

Takeaways

The effects of the EPA’s permitting reform will certainly vary by the particulars of a project, and likely by state as well, because state permitting agencies have broad discretion to enforce NSR requirements.[18] Developments that include significant non-emitting structures, such as manufacturing facilities and data centers, may benefit from accelerated timelines. However, construction of emission units cannot be completed without an NSR permit. And while permitting reform may allow for faster construction times, proceeding with pre-permit construction activities is unlikely to be a risk-free endeavor. At least in one response to a state agency — the MCAQD — the EPA expressed that the time and resources expended on pre-permit construction will not influence permitting decisions. Developers therefore retain potentially significant exposure by proceeding with construction of even non-emitting structures. Indeed, permits could impose conditions requiring modification to work that was already in progress or, even be outright denied.

While the full effects of the promised permitting reform will not be understood for some time, it is not too early for stakeholders to start to evaluate their potential risks and develop risk mitigation measures for their current and future projects. Potential risks that project participants may think through include:

Permit conditions that require modifying or rebuilding work already in progress

What happens to the project if a permit is delayed, or even denied outright

How risk and delay-related costs are allocated in both prime and downstream contracts (e.g., subcontracts and purchase orders), including, but not limited to, idle labor, storage and preservation of equipment, and extended insurance or bonding costs

Financing risks, such as the loss of financing or the inability to close on a construction loan due to permit delays or denial

Of course, each project brings with it unique circumstances, challenges, and risks, which may only be compounded as project stakeholders navigate permitting requirements.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters.
They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration's goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states' power. President Donald Trump's first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what's called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,"" said Jess Kramer, EPA's assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren't sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump's first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate"" the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government's power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Congress has said that when federally backed projects like oil pipelines or nickel mines affect water quality, fishing and drinking water, states and tribes get to review them and reject proposals that will do too much damage, according to Moneen Nasmith, director of national climate, fossil fuel infrastructure at the nonprofit Earthjustice.

“EPA’s claims that states and tribes are overreaching are baseless,"" she said. “This proposed rule is trying to solve for a problem that does not exist.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars"" like restoring America's energy dominance — Trump's shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

Looking back nearly two decades, Sommers reminded the audience that in 2007 the U.S. produced just 5 million barrels of oil per day and relied heavily on imports, including from Venezuela.
“Energy strength doesn’t happen by chance,” he said.
Over the past decade, the U.S. has shipped more than 8,000 LNG cargoes, contributing nearly half a trillion dollars to the economy and supporting 275,000 jobs.
At the same time, Sommers noted, American producers have driven down emissions per barrel through efficiency and innovation, arguing that “no other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions.” But production alone will not be enough.","At the American Petroleum Institute’s annual State of American Energy event, API President and CEO Mike Sommers framed the coming decade in blunt terms: energy demand is rising fast, and pretending otherwise is no longer a political luxury that the United States can afford.

Looking back nearly two decades, Sommers reminded the audience that in 2007 the U.S. produced just 5 million barrels of oil per day and relied heavily on imports, including from Venezuela. “Energy strength doesn’t happen by chance,” he said. “It is a choice.” That contrast, he argued, explains how the U.S. became the world’s leading oil and natural gas producer while Venezuela collapsed under what he described as “state-sponsored theft and corruption.”

Sommers referred to the next ten years as “the Demand Decade,” warning that “multiple forces are converging to drive up energy needs dramatically.” The question, he said, is not whether demand will materialize, but whether the U.S. energy system can deliver “with the speed, scale and reliability that this moment demands.”

The United States now produces more than 13 million barrels of oil per day and has become the world’s top LNG exporter. Over the past decade, the U.S. has shipped more than 8,000 LNG cargoes, contributing nearly half a trillion dollars to the economy and supporting 275,000 jobs. At the same time, Sommers noted, American producers have driven down emissions per barrel through efficiency and innovation, arguing that “no other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions.”

But production alone will not be enough. Infrastructure, Sommers said, is “the hinge point of the Demand Decade.” He pointed to the Mountain Valley Pipeline as a cautionary tale, saying it “took longer to permit and build than the entire Apollo space program,” adding that “a system that requires an act of Congress to build a pipeline is a system that’s broken.”

Sommers said voters are rejecting scarcity politics. “We’re done with that,” he said. “The mainstream has moved decisively toward abundance, affordability, and growth.” The choice, he concluded, is clear: “We choose energy success, not surrender.”

,EPA,2026-01-13 18:37:11+00:00,The Hill,Trump proposes rule aimed at preventing states from blocking energy projects for 'political purposes',Rachel Frazin,,,,,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5686660-trump-epa-energy-projects-ai/,"“When finalized, more efficient, effective and predictable permitting will unleash American energy dominance, support emerging AI infrastructure, benefit American industry and manufacturing and protect water quality,” she said.
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows states and tribes to block projects that may pollute their waters.
In high profile cases in past years, blue states have used this authority to block pipelines and a coal export terminal.

She also said the proposal would limit the scope of the reviews and that the Biden-era rule allowed them to be too expansive.","The Trump administration is proposing to impose more limitations on states’ authorities to block energy projects that run through their waters, saying the change will prevent states from shutting down projects for “political purposes.”

Jess Kramer, who leads the Environmental Protection Agency’s water office, told reporters the Trump administration is acting to make sure that the Clean Water Act “is not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes, as opposed to protecting water quality.”

Kramer added that the proposal would provide support for various industries, including artificial intelligence.

“When finalized, more efficient, effective and predictable permitting will unleash American energy dominance, support emerging AI infrastructure, benefit American industry and manufacturing and protect water quality,” she said.

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows states and tribes to block projects that may pollute their waters.

In high profile cases in past years, blue states have used this authority to block pipelines and a coal export terminal.

The issue is one that has ping ponged back and forth between political administrations — with the Biden administration seeking to give states more authority to block projects because of their water impacts.

Kramer said that Tuesday’s rule would include provisions that require states and tribes to tell projects upfront what they will need to evaluate the project to prevent delays where projects are required to withdraw and resubmit applications.

While the federal electric vehicles credits are gone and some EV sales have predictably dropped, a number of US states still have their own incentives. At the same time, the number of new public EV chargers is steadily expanding.

Some people might be focusing too much on a decline in the sales of some EVs in the US and overreacting to that data point. The current expansion of public EV charging is an important data point as well.

The new public chargers at Walmart locations are very fast — 400 kW — not Level 2 chargers that require hours of charging. Level 2 chargers are just fine in some situations, but for long-distance travel EV drivers typically want to charge in less than one hour.

Adding fast chargers at Walmart locations can draw EV drivers from out of town and in town who want a quick charge while they shop and perhaps have a beverage, a bite, or a biobreak. EV drivers tend to have some cash so providing charging opportunities for them at retail stores makes sense.

The new fast chargers are planned for about 78 Walmart locations, locations that will soon be providing a great service to EV drivers. You may notice some of the locations are in charging deserts or near charging deserts. Adding new fast chargers particularly matters in these areas.

But the party didn't last long. Following years of losses, manufacturing difficulties, and a shifting electric vehicle environment, Lucid's stock has cratered 88% since its initial public offering.

Some view this as a buying opportunity, with massive potential upside if Lucid becomes a major player in the global EV industry. The hope is that the company's advanced electric vehicles could eventually help propel Lucid ahead of its competition and push shares high enough to mint millionaires.

Unfortunately, I think those hopes are misplaced. Here are a few reasons Lucid isn't likely to make you rich anytime soon.

Lucid has significant losses and minimal revenue

Growth companies typically don't generate significant profits when they're just getting started, and that's been true for Lucid. The company's third-quarter 2025 net loss was approximately $1 billion, a very substantial amount.

Instead, most growth companies generate a lot of revenue and reinvest some of it into their company to spur new growth. The problem for Lucid is that has modest sales, reaching just $337 million in the third quarter (which ended Sept. 30), an increase of 68% from the year-ago quarter. That type of growth isn't enough to help the company invest in new technology, significantly ramp up production, or close the gap on its losses.

Designing and building electric vehicles is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. So to help offset all of its spending and lack of revenue, Lucid has had to receive multiple rounds of investment capital from the Saudi Public Investment Fund to keep the business going. While it's helped Lucid keep the company running, it's unclear whether or not it will have to raise additional capital in the future.

Adding to its difficulties is the fact that Lucid wants to launch a new, $50,000 midsize SUV sometime next year. While selling a car at a lower price point than its current models could be a way to drive sales, launching a new product and ramping up production will continue to sap Lucid's limited resources.

Electric vehicle competition is fierce

Another significant reason Lucid's shares may struggle to make substantial gains is that the EV market is currently experiencing a challenging period, and it remains unclear how long it will last.

Consider that the Trump administration ended the EV tax credits years before they were scheduled to expire, essentially dismantling many consumers' incentive to buy EVs. The effects are already being felt in the industry, with consumer EV sales estimated to drop from 11% of new car sales in December 2024 to about 6.6% in 2025.

While Lucid's vehicles were too expensive to benefit directly from the tax credit, buyers could take advantage of a leasing loophole with the credit. But that's no longer the case.

On top of all this, competition is fierce among global EV makers. Tesla, once the top electric vehicle seller, lost its title as the top-selling global EV brand to BYD, a Chinese automaker, last year. With BYD selling 2.26 million electric vehicles worldwide, not even Tesla's 1.6 million vehicle deliveries was enough to stay ahead of the competition.

While it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison, it's worth noting that Lucid delivered just 15,841 vehicles in 2025. BYD and Tesla sell in far more markets globally and are much larger companies than Lucid. However, if Lucid wants to compete globally, its shareholders need to understand that its vehicles will eventually have to compete against those of BYD, Tesla, and others.

There's little chance for Lucid to mint millionaires

Lucid makes impressive electric vehicle technology that has earned numerous accolades, including holding the world record for the longest distance driven on a single charge -- a remarkable 749 miles. But even its stand-out technology isn't enough to help the company generate significant sales.

Without a massive ramp-up in vehicle production and sales -- spurred by an influx of consumer demand -- I think it's very unlikely for Lucid's shares to gain enough to help shareholders become millionaires. Competition is too fierce, the company is spending too much money, and production and sales are too low for Lucid.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850286%2Flucid_gravity_dirt.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:42.398028

“The State’s Renew NC program is already helping homeowners across Western North Carolina.","The City of Asheville and State of North Carolina have formalized their partnership using $3 million in City of Asheville disaster recovery funding to support home repair and reconstruction for Asheville homeowners impacted by Tropical Storm Helene. North Carolina Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilley signed the agreement on January 7, 2026. The application period, open since June 2025, remains open for eligible residents through January 31 at RenewNC.org.

The funding is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) allocation to the City of Asheville and is dedicated specifically to the Renew NC Single-Family Home Repair Program, which assists homeowners across 28 counties whose primary residences were damaged by Tropical Storm Helene in September 2024.

Meeting the need

In January 2025, HUD allocated disaster recovery funding to Asheville to support long-term housing recovery efforts. Asheville’s CDBG-DR Action Plan designated $3 million to address unmet repair and reconstruction needs for owner-occupied, single-family homes via the Renew NC program.

The City of Asheville is partnering with the State of North Carolina Department of Commerce’s Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program to administer the program on the City’s behalf. Renew NC will manage application intake, eligibility determination, environmental reviews, case management, and construction activities and the City of Asheville will reimburse the State only for eligible construction costs incurred within city limits and monitor program compliance and execution.

“This partnership represents a critical turning point for our community,” said CDBG-DR Program Manager Elma King. “While emergency aid helped us get through the immediate aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene, these CDBG-DR funds are about long-term stability – ensuring that our residents aren’t just back in their houses, but are safe in homes that are fully repaired or rebuilt.”

Tiered assistance approach

Assistance will be provided through a tiered approach that prioritizes households earning less than 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) that include children, elderly residents, or individuals with disabilities, before moving to serve applicants in higher income categories if funds remain. Funding per household is limited to $50,000 for home rehabilitation and up to $450,000 for reconstruction, depending on eligibility and need.

“The State’s Renew NC program is already helping homeowners across Western North Carolina. By joining forces with the State’s Renew NC program, we are working to make the most of every dollar and every day since the Helene,” King said. “We are using Asheville’s recovery funding to pay for hard construction costs, allowing us to efficiently provide high-quality reconstruction and rehabilitation services that meet federal standards without duplicating administrative efforts.”

Asheville City Council authorized the subrecipient agreement with the State in October 2025, enabling the City to move forward with utilizing the $3 million allocation for single-family housing repairs.

Application Deadline & Link

The Renew NC application period will close at the end of the month. Homeowners impacted by Tropical Storm Helene are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. The deadline to apply is Saturday, January 31.

Higher oil prices would help the energy industry, which he has prioritized in his second term in office.","One of the campaign promises of President Donald Trump was to secure affordable energy for Americans. Even at the time, this promise put him at odds with the oil industry, already suffering from low oil prices. Now, the rift has deepened as the prospect of cheap Venezuelan crude pressures everyone but Big Oil. Thankfully for the industry, geopolitics still plays a role in price-setting. It’s good news for oil producers and bad news for consumers.

Almost every oil market forecaster predicted prices would go even lower this year than they were in 2025, when the benchmarks shed around a fifth of their value. Brent crude was forecast at an average of below $60, with West Texas Intermediate seen closer to $50, and possibly even falling below that level over the course of the year.

Another thing that forecasters agreed on was that such low prices would prompt a production response from non-OPEC countries, notably the United States. Shale drillers, who are responsible for the bulk of U.S. oil output, would find it hard to make ends meet at $50 or less per barrel so they would start curbing production, the argument went. It is a solid argument, based on historical evidence. Yet producers’ reaction would lead to higher oil prices, and that would go against President Trump’s campaign promise to Americans.

It was a risky proposition from the start, at least for the independent oil companies in the shale patch and outside it. Big Oil is not called Big Oil for nothing – it can survive low oil prices for much longer than independents. But for independents, Trump’s promise to jumpstart a revival in oil and gas—which had never stopped growing, by the way—has been a mixed bag. Sure, his federal government started making life easier for oil and gas companies from day one, easing the regulatory burden on the industry and opening up new acreage for exploration. But that promise of cheap oil has made it difficult for industry players to enjoy those changes.

It is not just U.S. industry players, by the way. The sustained decline in oil prices last year pushed capital expenditure on exploration and production lower than it had been in 2024. This year, upstream capex is also seen booking a decline on 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie. Notably, the energy consultancy expects a decline in capex in North America and Europe, while spending in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa is set to increase.

Mostly, the bearish outlook for oil is based on estimates of oversupply. Record amounts of oil on water—including sold cargoes en route to their destinations—are often cited as one reason for that perception. China’s gap between oil processing rates and imports is another. The International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration both expect the supply of crude oil to exceed demand by six figures this year. No wonder oil prices are weak, making President Trump happy.

Only they are now on the climb yet again as protests in Iran intensify, prompting worry among traders for the security of supply from OPEC, which exports its oil almost exclusively to China. It appears that worry is substantial enough to override the bearish mood following President Trump’s declaration that the United States had already started selling Venezuelan oil. Of course, countering that mood were reports that not all Big Oil majors are looking forward to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry, with Exxon specifically calling the country “uninvestable”. The statement prompted President Trump to threaten to block the supermajor from working in Venezuela.

Trouble in Iran, meanwhile, could spill over, jeopardizing oil transport in the Strait of Hormuz—the hottest chokepoint in global oil markets that everyone immediately thinks about when there is any violence in or around Iran. The current protests are no exception, in the context of threats made by President Trump against the Iranian government. With the Venezuelan incursion taking pretty much everyone by surprise, now everyone seems to expect more military action from the Trump administration, and not just in South America.

That expectation by itself is not enough to push oil prices much higher, MST Marquee’s head of energy research, Saul Kavonic, told Reuters. “The market is saying show me the disruption to supply before materially responding,” Kavonic said. The market may yet do just that: “There have also been calls for workers in the oil industry to down tools amid the protests,” ANZ energy analysts said in a note, as quoted in the above Reuters report. “The situation puts at least 1.9 million barrels per day of oil exports at risk of disruption,” they added.

This, and any plans President Trump may have regarding Iran, puts him in a complicated situation. Higher oil prices would help the energy industry, which he has prioritized in his second term in office. But higher prices would interfere with the affordable energy promise. Meanwhile, OPEC might yet reverse its production policy and start cutting output again. It is going to be another interesting year in oil.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with natural gas would cost $106.9 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 24.5%.
• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with a mix of nuclear and natural gas plants would cost $195.8 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent.
That’s $399.5 billion more than it would cost to go nuclear and $708 billion more than it would cost to build more natural gas plants.
The report did not calculate the cost savings to New Hampshire residents by our state’s continued reliance on natural gas.","New Englanders would save hundreds of billions of dollars and avoid deadly power blackouts by replacing state-mandated renewable energy projects with nuclear and natural gas power, a study released today by a coalition of New England think tanks finds.

Alternatives to New England’s Affordability Crisis, a new study released by a coalition of New England’s free-market think tanks, estimated the effects of trying to meet the region’s energy needs through 2050 with nuclear and natural gas plants instead of wind and solar power.

The findings are striking:

• Meeting New England’s 2050 energy needs with nuclear power would cost $415.3 billion and reduce the region’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 92%.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with natural gas would cost $106.9 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 24.5%.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with a mix of nuclear and natural gas plants would cost $195.8 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent.

Each of these options comes with the added benefit of avoiding power blackouts caused by relying too heavily on wind and solar power, which cannot run continuously, as nuclear and natural gas plants can.

All of the nuclear and natural gas options are significantly more affordable than the construction required by current renewable energy mandates imposed by five of the six New England states.

Meeting the region’s energy demand by sticking with those renewable energy mandates due to the NetZero by 2050 climate mandate would cost New Englanders a stunning $815 billion, the coalition found in its previous 2024 study. That’s $399.5 billion more than it would cost to go nuclear and $708 billion more than it would cost to build more natural gas plants.

“Again, we see that New England states would better serve their residents by adopting reality-based energy policies that prioritize reliability and costs. And again, New Hampshire leads the way,” said Drew Cline, President of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy.

“Affordability is the No. 1 political issue in the United States as we head into 2026. Any New England politician who wants to actually make substantial progress on affordability needs to read this report. Electricity prices are a top contributor to New England’s high cost of living. In building enough energy generation to meet the region’s needs in 2050, our report shows that energy prices would increase by 64.8 percent in the Nuclear scenario, 26.5 percent in the Happy Medium scenario, and just 13 percent in the Natural Gas scenario. These increases are a fraction of the Renewable scenario, which would increase prices by 126.4 percent,” Cline said.

The report did not calculate the cost savings to New Hampshire residents by our state’s continued reliance on natural gas. Instead, those cost savings are spread throughout the region.

By building a network of energy generation already focused on nuclear and natural gas, New Hampshire has kept its own costs lower than they otherwise would be, and also kept costs lower for the entire region.

This report shows that if the rest of New England adopted New Hampshire’s approach, the entire region would save hundreds of billions of dollars, avoid dangerous energy shortages, and still make progress on emissions reductions.

Our previous report in 2024 found that “the Granite State’s lack of electrification mandates for transportation and home heating reduces the projected peak system demand from 57 GW to 52.5 GW, and the continued use of natural gas provides critical dispatchable capacity for the system, allowing it to perform better during periods of low wind and solar output.”

“New Hampshire’s current energy policies would save all New Englanders $56.5 billion during the time period studied,” the report found.

New Hampshire has been a political pariah in New England for pursuing a reality-based energy policy focused on reliability and affordability. Political and media leaders from around the region boasted that their policies were virtuous and New Hampshire’s were selfish and immoral. Now, with the challenges of relying on wind and solar power in our region more clearly understood, policymakers in the Northeast have begun shifting more toward New Hampshire’s way of thinking about energy generation.

The new study was conducted by Always on Energy Research on behalf of the Maine Policy Institute, the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity, and the Yankee Institute, along with Americans for Prosperity Foundation.

The study draws on data from ISO-New England, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the Weldon Cooper Center and includes detailed modeling of generation capacity, cost-of-service, and peak demand scenarios through 2050.

Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases.
The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act.","WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency says it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs and preventable deaths avoided from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants.

The change means the EPA will focus rules for fine particulate matter and ozone only on the cost to industry, part of a broader realignment under President Donald Trump toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

The agency said in a statement late Monday that it “absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment"" but “will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The EPA will continue to estimate costs to businesses to comply with the rules and will continue “ongoing work to refine its economic methodologies” of pollution rules, spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.

“The EPA’s mandate is to protect public health, not to ignore the science in order to eliminate clean air safeguards that save lives,'' said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He called the change in how public health benefits are calculated “reckless, dangerous, and illegal,'' adding: “By pretending real health benefits do not count, EPA wants to open the door for industry to foul the air, while communities and families pay the price in asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.”

The change in how the EPA calculates health benefits was first reported by The New York Times.

The move comes as the Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

In a court filing in November, the EPA said the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

The EPA said it continues to recognize the “clear and well-documented benefits” of reducing fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, and ozone.

“Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact,” Hirsch said in an emailed statement, saying the agency remains committee to human health.

Since the EPA’s creation more than 50 years ago, Republican and Democratic administrations have used different estimates to assign monetary value to a human life in cost-benefit analyses.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated that its proposed rule on PM2.5 would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays by 2032. For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading. By failing to include ranges or other qualifying statements, EPA’s use of specific estimate “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality,” the agency said in an economic impact analysis for the new NOx rule.

“Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

The United States has made substantial progress in reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations since 2000, the agency said.

But critics said a new EPA rule that revises emission limits for dangerous nitrogen oxide pollution from new gas-burning turbines used in power plants demonstrates the risks of the new approach.

Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases. EPA’s final NOx rule, issued Monday, is substantially less restrictive than a proposal under the Biden administration. For some gas plants, the rule weakens protections in place for two decades.

The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act. Critics said the change means EPA will ignore the economic value of lives saved, hospital visits avoided and lost work and school days prevented.

Under Trump, the EPA ""recklessly refuses to place any value on protecting the health of millions of Americans from nitrogen oxides pollution in the face of mountains of medical science finding that this pollution contributes to asthma attacks, heart disease and other serious health problems.” said Noha Haggag, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, another environmental group.

“EPA is leaving millions of people in harm’s way when common sense solutions are at hand for modern national limits on nitrogen oxides pollution,'' Haggag said.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2e507a25-f342-4656-9d36-b2d6acab2b91/wirestory_771218fb0059f4c1b07981755d3453a1_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-13 13:01:04.427190

GFL Environmental and LRS recently acquired assets from each other in a deal that went into effect at the start of the year. LRS sold two hauling yards and a C&D landfill in Mayflower, Arkansas, while GFL sold unspecified assets in Indiana, according to sources.

Heavy equipment operators at the Mayflower, Arkansas, landfill voted last year to join International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 373 and are still negotiating their first contract. Chuck Stiles, assistant director of the Teamsters solid waste and recycling division, confirmed the deal and said local labor negotiators plan to meet with GFL next month.

The companies involved in the transaction declined to comment. The deal comes as LRS orients itself around its new Indianapolis hub, where it began providing waste and recycling collection services at the start of the year.

Dive Insight:

The two companies have a history of dealmaking. GFL acquired LRS’ Wisconsin assets last year, and LRS acquired GFL assets in Illinois and Minnesota in 2021. Previously, GFL acquired large hauler WCA Waste from a Macquarie-backed fund for $1.2 billion in 2020. Macquarie, which owns the fund that backs LRS, was a major investor in GFL before a recapitalization deal in 2018. GFL later went public.

LRS secured the waste collection contract for the city of Indianapolis, a service previously provided by WM and Republic Services, a year ago. LRS is now offering residents an opt-in recycling subscription service through the end of 2027, after which the hauler is set to roll out universal curbside recycling services.

LRS established a significant presence for itself in Indiana when it acquired Michiana Recycling & Disposal Service in January 2023. Rolled together with Michigan-based Modern Waste Systems, it was LRS’ largest acquisition to date, netting the company an operation with more than 200 employees and about 125 trucks. In August 2025, LRS expanded on its presence in the Indianapolis market with its acquisition of local hauler GHW.

LRS acquired the Mayflower landfill in 2021 as part of a broader deal for Ramco-Alternative Waste Management, which served the Little Rock market. That transaction also included a sizable fleet and operations in Kansas and Wisconsin.

GFL had a presence in Arkansas prior to the deal with LRS, including three landfills, two transfer stations and multiple hauling locations, according to the company’s website. Stiles said workers’ healthcare was switched to GFL’s plan on Jan. 2, and he said about 75 Arkansas workers in total were included in the deal.

Teamsters represents landfill workers but not the drivers. In the past, Stiles said the union has had largely productive conversations with LRS, and hundreds of LRS workers are now Teamsters. Stiles said the union has less experience with GFL, though he noted productive experiences with GFL in Canada and with WCA Waste in the past. Labor leaders expect to meet with GFL to discuss the Arkansas landfill contract on Feb. 18 and 19.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tq3y-LkKZKmnwBEdblC_3HdgSQAgkypHY8kOnxyYJoU/g:nowe:0:113/c:4032:2278/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9MUlNfUmVzaV9UcnVja18uanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-13 13:01:49.829629

Ørsted’s court hearing was the first, and judges are set to consider the fate of the other in-progress offshore wind projects this week.
A hearing for Dominion Energy’s massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is scheduled for Friday.
In addition, grid operators have been banking on the arrival of these large-scale offshore wind projects, several of which are more than halfway complete.
When he was reelected in 2024, BloombergNEF expected 39 GW of offshore wind capacity to come online in America by 2035.","A federal judge has ruled that Ørsted can resume the construction of its nearly complete, 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island.

The decision on Monday comes after the Trump administration issued stop-work orders to all five of the offshore wind projects under development in the U.S. in late December, the culmination of President Donald Trump’s yearlong war against the renewable energy source

Revolution Wind, a $6.2 billion project that is nearly 90% complete, was hit with an earlier federal stop-work order in August from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, a division of the Interior Department. A federal judge ruled in favor of Ørsted in September, allowing the project to move forward until December’s order, which cited unspecified issues of ​“national security.”

On Monday, the Danish developer said it will ​“resume construction work as soon as possible” while its complaint against the Trump administration is heard by the courts.

Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who issued the injunction, said from the bench on Monday that the bureau’s August suspension order was ​“the height of arbitrary and capricious” and that the December order’s vague claims of national security risks did ​“not constitute a sufficient explanation for the bureau’s decision to entirely stop work on the Revolution Wind project.” He noted that the government’s argument for halting construction was ​“unreasonable and seemingly unjustified.”

Each offshore wind project has been repeatedly vetted by the Department of Defense since being proposed, and developers said they were blindsided by the Trump administration’s latest security concerns.

Ørsted and two other offshore-wind developers, Equinor and Dominion Energy Virginia, all sued to vacate the Trump administration’s 90-day construction freeze from December. Ørsted’s court hearing was the first, and judges are set to consider the fate of the other in-progress offshore wind projects this week.

On Wednesday, a court could decide on Equinor’s 810-MW Empire Wind project, which also previously received and defeated a stop-work order. A hearing for Dominion Energy’s massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is scheduled for Friday. In addition to energy developers, the states of Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island have all sued to get the projects going again.

The stakes are high: In total, the five offshore wind farms affected by the Trump administration’s December order would bring nearly 6 GW of capacity to the grid, or enough to power roughly 2.5 million homes across the East Coast.

The U.S. can’t afford to lose any of these projects. Energy demand is climbing across the nation, causing household utility bills to soar. More power plants are needed to keep bills from rising even further — especially in regions swamped with power-hungry data centers, like Virginia.

In addition, grid operators have been banking on the arrival of these large-scale offshore wind projects, several of which are more than halfway complete. In August, ISO-New England issued an unprecedented warning that the Trump administration’s first pause on Revolution Wind created ​“unpredictable risks” that could ​“undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future.”

At least one project could be abandoned imminently. Equinor, which already lost nearly $1 billion because of the first stop-work order on Empire Wind, says the beleaguered project faces ​“likely termination” if it can’t continue work by this Friday.

Meanwhile, industry groups applauded Monday’s decision.

Kat Burnham, the New England policy lead for Advanced Energy United, said the D.C. court ​“rightly saw through a politically motivated stop-work order that would have caused real harm: driving up costs, delaying power for Rhode Island and Connecticut, and putting good-paying jobs at risk.” In a statement, she said the decision is ​“good news for workers, ratepayers, and anyone who recognizes the need for a fair energy market.”

The latest skirmish over offshore wind comes after a year of assault from the Trump administration. Trump has gummed up the build-out of onshore wind and solar power, too — but no energy source has been targeted like offshore wind.

The impact of Trump’s war on the sector is profound.

When he was reelected in 2024, BloombergNEF expected 39 GW of offshore wind capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 GW if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term. He did. As of October, BNEF expected just 6 GW to get online by 2035 — a number that will be even lower if any of the in-progress projects buckle under the weight of the latest order.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/REV_082025_18040001.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=788ab51081678b7571903c12d5d717f6,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:52.483637

We recently submitted comments to the EPA voicing concern and opposition to its proposed “Waters of the United States” rule that redefines which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act protections.
We’re opposing the weakening of federal clean water protections because polluters should not get special treatment over the health of our people and environment.
These include the Site Location of Development Act, the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, and the Natural Resources Protection Act.
Robust clean water protections are critical to prevent industrial polluters from bending the rules and threatening the health and safety of people and wildlife.","For more than half a century, the Clean Water Act has helped curb pollution flowing into our rivers, lakes, and streams. And now the safeguards that are embedded in this landmark environmental law are at risk due to changes being proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The Clean Water Act has deep ties to Maine. It was a crowning accomplishment for Senator Edmund Muskie, who grew up in Rumford and was prompted into action because he saw that our rivers were being treated as open sewers. His determination to remedy that resulted in one of the nation’s most important environmental laws, and now, our waterways and drinking water are safer and cleaner because of it.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine has always stood with Mainers to protect clean water. We recently submitted comments to the EPA voicing concern and opposition to its proposed “Waters of the United States” rule that redefines which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act protections. The proposed change would leave up to 97% of non-tidal wetlands in Maine without these federal protections, removing a crucial policy backstop and creating uncertainty for our drinking water, flood protections, and critical habitat.

We’re opposing the weakening of federal clean water protections because polluters should not get special treatment over the health of our people and environment.

Maine is known for clean water. As the most forested state in the country, with a relatively small population concentrated in urban areas along the coast, Mainers today reap the benefits of high water quality in our inland lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. The state’s pristine waters are a principal driver of tourism here in Maine, where “Vacationland” is proudly printed on our license plates, and, as an industry, attracted more than 15 million visitors and contributed $9 billion to the economy in 2023. It also directly supports jobs in the fishing, outdoor recreation, and real estate sectors, to name a few. It’s the reason why our state is home to the last stronghold of native brook trout in the eastern U.S.

Around the same time that the Clean Water Act was created, several state laws were also passed here in Maine that protect water resources. These include the Site Location of Development Act, the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, and the Natural Resources Protection Act.

As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on Sackett v. EPA, many wetlands and small streams around the country that lack a “continuous surface connection” to “traditional interstate navigable waters” were stripped of protections awarded under the Clean Water Act.

Fortunately for us here in Maine, these resources still have substantial protection under the three state laws mentioned previously. However, with the Clean Water Act no longer in play, we are missing an important safeguard that served as a critical second line of defense for decades.

We also know we can’t take our state’s clean water laws for granted. Back in 2011, several pieces of state legislation designed to rollback key environmental protections under these three laws were introduced in Maine as part of an anti-regulatory campaign brought forward by Governor LePage. This included an effort to substantially weaken the Site Location of Development Act (LD 159), five different efforts to weaken the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act (LDs 219, 339, 434, 888, and 1108), and three different efforts to weaken the Natural Resources Protection Act (LDs 156, 387, and 872).

These proposed changes were fought by environmental groups across the state, and although they were each threatening in their own ways, organizations like NRCM felt assured at the time that no matter what happened, our waterbodies would still be subject to federal protection under the Clean Water Act. If these changes go into effect, that assurance will be gone for many streams and wetlands here in Maine whose protection now lies solely with state and local governments.

EPA Administrator Zeldin’s proposed rule change favors polluters and fails to listen to the thousands of Mainers who are demanding strong protections for clean water. If finalized, the rule would fail to meet the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways in Maine and across the United States.

After recent federal rollbacks, a strong definition of the “Waters of the United States” rule is even more essential for protecting wetlands and waterways. Robust clean water protections are critical to prevent industrial polluters from bending the rules and threatening the health and safety of people and wildlife.

We can’t protect Maine’s future if we don’t protect the health of our environment. Maintaining strong, common-sense environmental laws are needed to protect the outdoor spaces we all love.

How the Battleship North Carolina got to its home in Wilmington

Sixty-five years ago, a state-wide fundraising effort saved a more than 70 million-pound, 700-foot long behemoth of a WWII warship from being scrapped. The USS North Carolina is now a museum in Wilmington, and it would not have made it there without the contributions of thousands of North Carolina children.

The museum now has an effort underway to collect the stories of the “kid heroes” who helped save the ship back in 1961.

In October of last year, the Trump Administration and Secretary Wright illegally canceled 300 energy projects across the country – stealing $8 billion in grants for energy projects when we desperately need more energy.
These actions and the Big Ugly Bill are going to seriously undermine energy reliability.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) delivered the following opening remarks at today's Energy Subcommittee legislative hearing on addressing threats to America’s energy infrastructure:

America’s energy system is under increasing threat. Russia and China have developed sophisticated offensive cyber weapons, and the proliferation of artificial intelligence technology means that every day those offensive cyber weapons grow stronger. It also means that less sophisticated adversaries – terrorist organizations without the backing of nation-states – will be able to pull off devastating cyberattacks, whether it is against the federal government, utilities, or directly against energy infrastructure assets themselves.

That is why I am pleased to see a suite of draft legislation in this hearing, including some bills reauthorizing important cybersecurity programs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I’m encouraged to see my Republican colleagues now acknowledge the importance and benefits of some of the provisions of that law. Others, like the Energy Threat Analysis Center Act, are completely new, and are based off valuable testimony that this Subcommittee received last year.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about these bills because it is critical that we work in a bipartisan fashion to secure our nation’s energy infrastructure from cyber and physical threats.

And as we consider the cybersecurity of our energy systems we also have to recognize the importance that energy reliability plays in our way of life. But unfortunately, I am concerned that Secretary Wright’s actions at the Department of Energy are undermining that reliability.

In October of last year, the Trump Administration and Secretary Wright illegally canceled 300 energy projects across the country – stealing $8 billion in grants for energy projects when we desperately need more energy. In July, the Administration put out an analysis desperately calling for every available megawatt of power, but Secretary Wright is directly responsible for killing projects that would have added enormous amounts of clean power to the grid.

These projects were authorized by Congress and funded through bipartisan laws. Thankfully, just yesterday, a court reversed the termination notices for a number of the illegally canceled grants, and I am hopeful that more projects sue the Department for its actions and get their funding restored.

Now the problem is it doesn’t end there. Since Trump took office, the Department of Energy has shed roughly 3,500 staff, and is so understaffed in some areas that its Office of Nuclear Energy is asking for volunteers from universities to help them review novel nuclear reactor designs. That doesn’t really sound like energy security to me. And late last year, the Department of Energy underwent a reorganization, closing important offices like the Grid Deployment Office, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.

Throughout the entire process, Secretary Wright has refused to answer questions, leaving Congress with zero information and no opportunity as to what is happening at the Department. So I am hopeful, Mr. Fitzsimmons – a number of your DOE colleagues have appeared before us in the last year, but have given unsatisfactory answers, or claimed to not have any information to share. So I am hoping that you will be more responsive today.

And let’s also not forget the Big Ugly Bill – or as Republicans call it beautiful, I say it’s the ugly bill – which is slated to increase electricity prices by 61 percent, and endanger more than 300 gigawatts of reliable, clean generation just when we need it most. Electricity prices are up 13 percent just since Trump took office, and companies have either delayed or canceled over $53 billion in investment in the energy sector and we’ve lost over 165,000 jobs in this sector.

These actions and the Big Ugly Bill are going to seriously undermine energy reliability. I am hopeful that these cybersecurity bills will be helpful – but to be honest, and I’m not taking away from them, they’re really just a drop in the bucket when you look at the energy reliability problems that Republicans are creating for the American people. And those problems are just getting worse every day. In New Jersey, electricity bills are up over 20 percent. So, you know, this is a major problem for the public and I hope we can deal with it more effectively on a bipartisan basis.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

DOE remains at the heart of American energy innovation.
To adequately address these key imperatives, we must prioritize American energy innovation.","A new frontier in energy is emerging — and that leaves us with an important choice that will determine whether the United States continues to lead the world in energy innovation, as we have for the previous 150 years, or cedes that leadership to other countries.

Our energy system has historically represented American ingenuity and dominance. If we fail to develop and deliver clean energy technologies at scale here at home, the consequences will be significant. America’s national security, economic might and global standing will all suffer.

The path forward is clear: Now is the time to rebuild American energy innovation leadership to create a more affordable, cleaner and secure energy future. If America acts now, we can lower costs for families, create jobs across the country and ensure our energy future is developed domestically. That’s the promise of energy innovation for Americans nationwide, and that’s why our team has released our new report, Re-Energizing America.

Our history offers a blueprint for progress. Half a century ago, a global oil crisis sent shockwaves through our economy. With foreign producers and global markets determining the price of oil, our weaknesses were exposed. In response, we did what Americans do best: we took action. Our leaders founded the Department of Energy, launched massive investments in energy research and committed to making and powering things right here at home.

DOE remains at the heart of American energy innovation. From the first viable solar cells invented in New Jersey to the infrastructure and ingenuity enabling the shale boom in Texas and Pennsylvania, American innovation has allowed these technologies to flourish. Continued leadership of the next generation of energy tech, however, will require smart economic strategy, a competitive edge on the global stage and sustained federal investment.

Four policy priorities drive the need for renewed federal commitment: energy security, affordability, economic opportunity and decarbonization. Our dependence on foreign supply chains — alongside China’s dominance in emerging energy technologies — is creating new national security risks. Meanwhile, rising energy costs have reminded us how closely power prices shape economic stability and household budgets.

To adequately address these key imperatives, we must prioritize American energy innovation. With major federal funding set to expire this year, our nation faces an innovation cliff. To ensure we lead the world in energy innovation, the solution is straightforward: a federal investment of $25 billion for DOE’s research, development and demonstration programs by 2030. This budget, representing less than one percent of the total 2030 federal budget, is built from a strategic assessment of technology priorities, historic investment and comparison of the U.S. to global peers and competitors.

Success in meeting America’s energy challenges will also require a fundamental change in how federal agencies approach innovation. Transforming DOE will take both structural reforms and cultural shifts that prioritize collaboration, speed and long-term thinking. The goal must be to create an institution built for sustained engagement — one that serves as a reliable partner to American innovators and a trusted engine for our nation’s energy security and economic future.

The scale and urgency of today’s energy challenges demand future-forward investments and a renewed sense of national purpose. The next 50 years will be defined by how we respond to transformational forces such as electrification, AI-driven industrial change and the global transition to cleaner energy systems — all while ensuring America’s global standing, resilient supply chains and the economic benefits and jobs that come from successfully navigating this transition.

Now is the time to choose our energy future. The choice is ours to make, but we must decide to act.

Not anymore. Under President Trump, the E.P.A. plans to stop tallying gains from the health benefits caused by curbing two of the most widespread deadly air pollutants, fine particulate matter and ozone, when regulating industry, according to internal agency emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times.

The Times’ report, based on EPA materials that have not been independently reviewed by MS NOW, added that the change represents “a seismic shift” that’s plainly at odds with the reason the EPA exists.

Zeldin slammed the newspaper’s report as “dishonest,” but the Natural Resources Defense Council’s John Walke, a clean air advocate and former EPA lawyer, shredded Zeldin’s response to the Times’ article.

But it can’t do both.

Indeed, these conflicts are becoming increasingly common. When RFK Jr. campaigned for the Republican ticket in 2024, for example, the conspiracy theorist delivered a promise to voters: If he joined Trump’s team, he’d “ban the worst agricultural chemicals.”

Additionally, over the next four years, NextEra Energy has plans to invest an additional $120 billion in America’s energy infrastructure.","NextEra Energy is one of the biggest names in the energy sector. Tracing its origins to the launch of Florida Power & Light Company in 1925, the company has grown to become the largest energy infrastructure builder in the country, with a presence in 49 states, representing 76 gigawatts of battery storage, solar, natural gas, nuclear, and wind. NextEra Energy’s subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, spans 41 states and has 42 gigawatts of generating capacity, in addition to building transmission infrastructure.

NextEra Energy is contributing to cheaper, more reliable energy for Americans across the country. The company maintains a diverse portfolio of energy sources “to offer customers the lowest bill possible,” with renewables accounting for 57%, natural gas 34%, nuclear 8%, and other resources 1%. “From keeping the lights on today to modernizing transmission networks and developing next-generation energy projects,” NextEra Energy Resources explains, it is “helping America achieve true energy dominance and independence… Every project we build strengthens America’s energy security and economic leadership.” In Iowa, for example, the upcoming Lake Mills Wind project will provide 320 megawatts (MW) of clean energy to Winnebago County, while the Rock Creek Solar project will provide 150 megawatts of solar energy and 100 megawatts of battery storage to Clinton County and the cities of Clinton and Camanche.

These projects contribute to local economies in big ways. Over the past decade, NextEra Energy has invested $154 billion in local economies and paid approximately $8 billion in property taxes, which fund local schools, roads, other infrastructure, and emergency response services. Meanwhile, NextEra Energy Resources has struck deals with about 30,000 landowners, particularly in rural communities, offering them support from a dedicated team and stable compensation that they can reinvest in their operations. As Megan Murphy Salyer, a developer with NextEra, described this relationship: “You hear from the landowners who care deeply about the land. They’ve invested their lives in the land. They are the caretakers of it. Seeing them trust us to continue that role of caretaking in a way that provides them a stable income for generations and keep the land in the family is huge.”

In Iowa alone, NextEra Energy Resources has invested more than $3 billion since 1999, with $68 million in annual payroll impact, $11 million in annual property taxes, and $12 million in annual land payments. The upcoming Rock Creek Solar project represents an additional $320 million investment that will generate $11.6 million in tax revenue for Clinton County and the cities of Clinton and Camanche. The upcoming Lake Mills Wind project, meanwhile, will generate $200 million in tax revenue for Winnebago County, plus $180 million in landowner payments over its lifetime.

Additionally, over the next four years, NextEra Energy has plans to invest an additional $120 billion in America’s energy infrastructure. These investments will continue to “ripple through the economy, boosting local businesses in hospitality, transportation, and retail throughout both project development and operation,” the company wrote.

NextEra is also a vital local employer. As of the end of 2024, NextEra Energy employed more than 16,000 Americans. The Lake Mills Wind project, in particular, is creating up to 770 construction jobs, while the Rock Creek Solar project is creating up to 300. The company also invests in the future workforce by donating funds and tools, such as 3D printers and virtual reality technology, to community colleges through its STEM Classroom Makeover Grant.

Through its Renewable Energy Training (RET) initiative, meanwhile, it supports STEM programs and workshops for hundreds of students each year. For example, at Barstow College in Iowa, students can learn about a wide range of renewable technologies at a STEM camp. Internally, the Renewable Training Center in Iowa recorded more than 1,100 solar course completions last year alone. As David Smith, a member of the NextEra training team, summarized, “By encouraging our employees to push the boundaries of what’s possible, we tap into their creativity.”

These investments position America to excel across numerous industries. “As the nation faces surging electricity demand to foster technological innovation and power a resurgence in domestic manufacturing,” NextEra Energy Resources notes, “we’re building the infrastructure America needs to compete, grow and lead.”

NextEra Energy Resources is also at the forefront of innovation in new and important technologies. The company is planning to reopen the Duane Arnold Energy Center, the state’s sole nuclear power plant, which was shut down in 2020 after sustaining damage from a windstorm. Once operational, it will be a reliable, home-grown power source, generating 615 megawatts and providing electricity to American homes and businesses, reducing reliance on foreign energy imports. In partnership, Google entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement to buy this energy for its cloud and AI infrastructure in the state, with the remainder set to be purchased by the Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO). NextEra and Google also plan to explore more nuclear development across the country.

The economic impact cannot be understated here, either. Over the next 25 years, the center is expected to generate $9 billion in economic benefits for Linn County and the state, raise $75 million in taxes, and create 400 long-term jobs. As NextEra chairman and CEO John Ketchum reflected, “Google and NextEra Energy are answering the call of America’s golden age of power demand, creating thousands of jobs, strengthening Iowa’s economy, delivering long-term value to our shareholders and helping power America’s future through innovation and technology.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/482076898_1078809167608798_291436744535838906_n-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:56.292316

In November, the Biden EPA proposed finding that for most combustion turbines, the use of combustion controls plus SCR is the BSER.
The standards come amid a surge in proposed gas-fired power plants across the United States, in part driven by rising electric demand forecasts from data centers.
The EPA estimated that the final rule will save power plant owners $87 million over eight years.
Groups criticized the EPA’s decision to stop considering the health benefits of reduced pollution in its regulatory analysis.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday issued a final rule onnitrogen oxide standards for new gas-fired power plants and other stationary turbines. The standards are significantly more lenient than a proposal issued in November during the Biden administration.

The EPA determined that the “best systems of emissions reduction,” or BSER, for NOx emissions is the continued use of combustion controls for all but one subcategory of new, modified or reconstructed turbines. The BSER for new large turbines with 12-month capacity factors over 45% is combustion controls combined with post-combustion selective catalytic reduction, or SCR.

In November, the Biden EPA proposed finding that for most combustion turbines, the use of combustion controls plus SCR is the BSER.

The EPA estimated its final new source performance standards for stationary combustion turbines will cut annual NOx emissions by up to 296 tons by 2032 — significantly less than the 2,659 tons the proposed rule was estimated to cut.

The new standards cover facilities that started construction, modification or reconstruction after Dec. 13, 2024. The standards were last updated in 2006.

NOx contributes to asthma, bronchitis, respiratory infections and premature mortality by reacting with other volatile organic compounds to form ozone and fine particulate matter, according to the EPA.

The standards come amid a surge in proposed gas-fired power plants across the United States, in part driven by rising electric demand forecasts from data centers. The PJM Interconnection, for example, has approved about 8.1 GW of gas-fired capacity for fast-track interconnection review. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator has approved or is reviewing about 9.2 GW of gas-fired generation in its fast-track interconnection process and the Southwest Power Pool is studying about 9.6 GW of gas-fired capacity in its similar interconnection review.

The EPA estimated that the final rule will save power plant owners $87 million over eight years. The savings come from combining the cost to power plants that will have more-stringent standards to the savings from those that will have less-stringent standards, the EPA said in a fact sheet.

The agency expected its proposed rule would have cost $166 million in the same period, but it would have provided net benefits of up to $340 million, partly through improved public health.

EPA drops health benefits analysis

In a change from agency practice, the EPA declined to estimate the monetary benefits of improved public health caused by the final rule, saying those estimates are too uncertain.

“Because of the significant impacts of environmental regulations on the U.S. economy, it is essential that the Agency have confidence in the estimated benefits of an action prior to utilizing these estimates in a regulatory context,” the EPA said in its economic impact analysis of the final rule.

Groups criticized the EPA’s decision to stop considering the health benefits of reduced pollution in its regulatory analysis.

“Communities across the country are scrambling to fight the threat of surging pollution harms from new fossil gas plants built to meet insatiable data center electricity demand,” Julie McNamara, associate policy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Climate and Energy Program, said in a statement Monday. “Instead of protecting people’s health, however, these deficient new gas turbine standards make clear Trump’s EPA is only here to boost the profits of Big Tech and the fossil fuel interests that serve them.”

The EPA’s failure to assess the monetary benefits from saving lives and improving people’s health by curbing fine particulate matter and ozone may be challenged in court, according to Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group.

EPA’s analyses have shown trillions of dollars of economic benefits from protecting public health and welfare under the Clean Air Act, according to John Walke, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jCA50yCu6zcbii5_EEw48m7BP9FW4TVsHvukyul7l3U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI2NzEwMzcxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-13 11:02:28.962451

Industrial sector emissions rose modestly due to higher industrial activity, and oil and gas emissions ticked up slightly with increased production.
We estimate that US GHG emissions grew faster than the economy, breaking a three-year trend of economic growth outpacing emissions growth.
Power sector emissions also increased in 2024; this stretch marks the first consecutive two-year period of power sector emissions growth since 2012-2013.
Industrial power demand, which accounts for a smaller share of total power demand, increased by 1.9% due to increased output in electricity-intensive subindustries.","Based on preliminary economic and energy activity data, we estimate that in 2025, US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by 2.4%, marking a change from the prior two years of decreases in emissions. Emissions also grew faster than the economy in 2025, with real GDP expanding by a projected 1.9%—reversing the decoupling of emissions and economic activity of the prior two years. Emissions in 2025 were 6% below pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and 18% below 2005 levels.

The increase in emissions was driven primarily by the buildings and power sectors. Colder winter temperatures drove higher space heating demand in buildings, pushing up direct emissions from fuel use in buildings by 6.8%. Higher natural gas prices and growing power demand boosted coal electricity generation, resulting in a 3.8% rise in power sector emissions. Elsewhere, changes in emissions were more subdued. Industrial sector emissions rose modestly due to higher industrial activity, and oil and gas emissions ticked up slightly with increased production. Despite record travel activity, transportation emissions were essentially flat due to the growing adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. US emissions in 2025 were not meaningfully impacted by policies enacted by the 119th Congress and the Trump administration, but we project that those policy changes could have increasing effects in the years to come.

Economic growth and rising emissions

Economic growth is a major determinant of GHG emissions, and in 2025, the US inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (real GDP) expanded at a projected rate of 1.9%. This marks about a 30% decline from the growth rates recorded in each of the prior three years. The economy grew despite significant economic turbulence and uncertainty introduced by federal government changes to trade, tariff, tax, and energy policies, as well as the longest government shutdown in US history. Consumer spending, the core driver of US GDP, has so far remained resilient to these shocks and an inflation rate of nearly 3%, while continued investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure were another major source of economic growth.

We estimate that US GHG emissions grew faster than the economy, breaking a three-year trend of economic growth outpacing emissions growth. Using preliminary economic and energy activity data, we project that economy-wide emissions grew by 2.4% in 2025 (Figure 1). This puts US emissions 6% below pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and 18% below 2005 levels.

Higher space heating demand and a growing power sector

Increased demand for space heating currently correlates directly with increased emissions, as the majority of homes in the regions with the coldest temperatures rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for heat. Colder 2025 winter temperatures led to increased direct combustion of these fuels in buildings, driving up emissions by 56 million metric tons (MMT), or 6.8%, compared to 2024.

In the power sector, a 2.4% increase in total electricity generation and a 13% increase in coal generation relative to 2024 pushed emissions from electricity generation up by 55 MMT (3.8%). This marks only the second year in the last 10 years that coal generation has increased—a notable departure from its general downward trajectory, in which coal generation has shrunk by 64% since its peak in 2007. Power sector emissions also increased in 2024; this stretch marks the first consecutive two-year period of power sector emissions growth since 2012-2013.

Based on historic and forecasted sectoral consumption data, the largest source of increased electricity use was commercial buildings, where data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and other large load customers drove electricity demand up by 2.4%. This growth was concentrated in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Ohio Valley regions. Residential buildings saw the next largest increase, with electricity demand up by 2.2%. This was primarily due to space heating demand from colder winter weather, but electric vehicle consumption is increasingly a significant contributor. Industrial power demand, which accounts for a smaller share of total power demand, increased by 1.9% due to increased output in electricity-intensive subindustries.

The main driver of higher coal use was higher natural gas prices, up 58% at Henry Hub in 2025 compared to very low levels seen in 2024, as a result of high space heating demand from colder temperatures and rising LNG exports (Figure 4). Generation from coal and natural gas together made up 57% of total generation, down slightly from 58% in 2024, illustrating how these resources compete with each other.

The pace of coal plant retirements also slowed, as utilities delayed planned retirements to help meet rising power demand and in response to orders from the Department of Energy. Through November, only 2.5 GW of conventional steam coal capacity had retired, compared with 4.5 GW in 2024 and an average of nearly 9 GW a year since 2020.

At the same time, the fastest growing power generation source in 2025 was solar, which surged by 34%—its highest growth rate since 2017. This pushed the grid share of zero-emitting sources up by one percentage point to 42%, despite only a modest increase in wind and flat nuclear and hydroelectric generation. Natural gas remained the single largest source of electricity, though it fell by nearly three percentage points to 40% of the grid mix.

Higher industrial output and fossil fuel production

Industrial emissions grew by 15 MMT (1.3%) relative to 2024, reflecting modest growth in total industrial output. The overall increase in output was driven by emissions-intensive subindustries such as chemicals, primary metals, and nonmetallic mineral production. However, that growth was moderated by broad declines in the manufacture of other consumer and commercial goods, including food and beverages, paper products, and motor vehicles.

Oil and gas production emissions were essentially flat—up by only 1 MMT (0.5%) relative to 2024—despite natural gas and petroleum production increasing by 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Over the past decade, state and federal regulations combined with a trend toward cleaner production practices, especially reductions in methane venting, have steadily reduced methane emissions per barrel of oil and per cubic foot of natural gas. We estimate that the methane intensity of gas and oil systems declined by 44% and 62%, respectively, between 2015 and 2025. The extent to which this trend will continue remains to be seen as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has targeted the federal regulations for oil and gas production methane emissions for repeal.

Flat transportation emissions

In transportation—the highest-emitting sector—emissions were virtually flat relative to 2024, increasing by only 2 MMT (0.1%). This was the result of increases in diesel and jet fuel emissions slightly outweighing gasoline emissions reductions (Figure 5). The US is on track for a fifth straight year of record-high road activity, with a 1% increase in road traffic volumes through October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. And available seat miles—a measure of passenger flight capacity—are on track to set their own record in 2025, based on available data through September showing the metric up 2% year-on-year. Despite an increase in miles driven, gasoline consumption declined due to an increasingly fuel-efficient vehicle fleet. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) made up nearly 10% of all passenger car and light truck sales in 2025, and traditional hybrids (HEVs) were another 12% of sales, based on data through November 2025. BEV sales growth was effectively flat, and PHEV sales declined by 14% compared to last year, while HEV sales showed continued, strong growth of 25% compared to 2024. BEV and PHEV sales dropped sharply in the fourth quarter after the expiration of clean vehicle federal tax credits for consumers and businesses.

Something unusual happened with diesel this year: consumption went down but emissions went up. Biomass-based diesel consumption was down 34% relative to 2024, reversing a steady growth trend and boosting consumption of petroleum-based diesel by 2%. Biomass-based diesel imports fell steeply because of their loss of eligibility for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit this year. Domestic biomass-based diesel production also fell due to uncertainty about how Renewable Fuel Standard blending requirements would be updated by the EPA. Around a quarter of diesel consumption is in the industrial and buildings sectors, where higher industrial output and space heating demand also increased petroleum-based diesel use.

Looking ahead

US GHG emissions have been trending downward since peaking in 2007, averaging about a 1% decline each year, even with the last few years of increasing emissions (Figure 6). Our longer-term outlook for US GHG emissions changed sharply this past year. In our 2025 edition of Taking Stock, our annually updated outlook for US emissions under current policy, we project US emissions will decline by 26-35% below 2005 levels in 2035. In the highest emission scenario, this reflects an even slower rate of decarbonization progress over the next decade than we’ve seen over the past 15 years. This year’s projections represent a substantial slowdown in emissions reductions compared to our outlook in 2024, which projected a decline of 38-56% by 2035 relative to 2005. This slowdown is largely due to changes to energy tax credits made by the 119th Congress in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill and the repeal of climate regulations by the Trump administration. Apart from some modest contributions to increased coal generation from Department of Energy orders to keep a few plants running, we aren’t yet seeing the direct effects of these policy changes in US emissions. That could change in the coming year or two, particularly if data center electricity demand continues to surge and the grid responds with more output from existing fossil generators instead of new, clean resources. The growth in electric vehicles, which has in part helped keep a lid on transportation sector emissions, may also stall in the absence of federal tax credits and regulatory policies.

Beyond policy changes that will result in higher emissions, the Trump administration has also moved to stop collecting and reporting a multitude of data on GHG emissions and climate change. Two of these data products in particular—the EPA’s annual GHG inventory and its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for major emitting facilities—are integral inputs to our work. Typically, we would expect EPA to give the US its final GHG report card for 2025 in spring 2027. However, EPA only released the 2023 inventory earlier this year when compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request, and most of the work had already been completed under the Biden administration. Given the Trump administration’s hostility to collecting and reporting data related to climate change, we may not receive any further inventories under this administration.

The loss of this data means we are heading into murkier waters when it comes to understanding the second-largest emitter of GHGs in the world. While US emissions rose, 2025 was the second- or third-hottest year on record across the globe. Because emissions and their impacts persist even when the government does not count them, we will continue to adapt to this new landscape in order to inform critical US energy and climate policy debates.",https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-emissions-2025-1024x683.webp,N,,2026-01-13 14:13:21.983921

Many affordable EVs have officially reached price parity with gas-powered vehicles in 2026 when you factor in lower fuel and maintenance costs, allowing these budget-friendly electric cars to offer the lowest total cost of ownership for American drivers.

Our 2026 guide ranks the best affordable electric cars in the US market.

What are the best cheap EVs to buy in the USA?

For the purposes of this article, prices are listed in USD, and do not include potential extra destination charges or potential federal tax credits or state incentives that may reduce the final cost of the EV.

Nissan Leaf

The Nissan Leaf was the pioneer of the consumer EV market, following the first model back in 2010. The third-generation Nissan Leaf, new for 2026, remains one of the most affordable ways into a new electric vehicle in the US, reducing entry barriers to EV ownership.

Going on sale soon across the US, pricing will initially start at $29,990 for the ‘S+’ model. That low price doesn’t give any compromise on battery range however, with this model carrying a 75kWh battery pack which offers an EPA-estimated range of 303 miles. This affordable model still packs a decent list of standard equipment, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, remote climate control, a 28-inch driver display, and more. With the front-driven electric motor offering up 214 horsepower, it’s got more than enough power to easily merge onto highways too.

Further down the line, Nissan will also release a more entry-level ‘S’ specification, with a price tag even lower than the initial launch price of $29,990.

Tesla Model 3

The Tesla Model 3 is a little more expensive than the other cars on this list, but it still offers a great value when you consider the combination of performance, technology, and tight-knit public charging integration you get for the price.

Prices for the Model 3 start at $36,990, and even this entry-level specification still offers an EPA range of 321 miles, and an impressive 0-60mph time of 5.8 seconds. You’ll need to pay extra for features such as full self-driving, however.

Chevrolet Bolt

Arriving this year, the all-new Chevrolet Bolt will return as one of the most affordable electric cars on the market. At launch, the starting price will be $29,990, identical to the Leaf. Later down the line, Chevrolet will release a more affordable specification with prices starting at $28,995.

The new Bolt uses LFP batteries to keep its price down, whilst also offering a longer driving range than the previous generation Bolt – up at 255 miles, compared to 238 miles before.

Hyundai Kona Electric

The Kona Electric is another affordable compact SUV on this list, offering a compelling blend of range, tech, and utility in a segment-favorite

crossover package.

The entry-level Kona Electric SE starts at approximately $32,795 USD. With an EPA estimated range of 261 miles, and standard equipment

such as Hyundai’s dual-screen infotainment setup, connectivity features, and a spacious cabin, this is a great affordable all rounder to finish off the list.",https://electricdrives.tv/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cheapest-electric-cars-usa-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:59:51.811928

The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz.

So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.","For years, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a dollar value to the lives saved and the health problems avoided through many of its environmental regulations.

Now, that has changed. The EPA will no longer consider the economic cost of harm to human health from fine particles and ozone, two air pollutants that are known to affect human health. The change was written into a new rule recently published by the agency. It weakened air pollution rules on power plant turbines that burn fossil fuels, which are sources of air pollution of many types, including from fine particles, sometimes called soot.

The EPA writes in its regulatory impact analysis for the new rule that, for now, the agency will not consider the dollar value of health benefits from its regulations on fine particles and ozone because there is too much uncertainty in estimates of those economic impacts.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch clarified that the agency is still considering health benefits. But it will not assign a dollar amount to those benefits until further notice, as it reconsiders the way it assesses those numbers.

Health experts worry that the move could lead to rollbacks of air pollution rules, which could result in rising pollution levels, leading to more health risks for millions of Americans.

""I'm worried about what this could mean for health,"" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist and air pollution expert at Harvard University and the director of Harvard's Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment. ""Especially for people with chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD, for kids whose lungs are still developing, and for older people, who are especially susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution on the heart, lungs and the brain.""

Fine particles, known as PM2.5, come from a variety of sources, including power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and gas. Long-term exposure to fine particle pollution is known to cause significant health risks, from higher rates of asthma to more heart attacks to dementia, and even premature death. Cleaning up pollution from fine particles has, by the agency's previous estimates, saved more than 230,000 lives and billions of dollars per year in recent years.

The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz. The economic costs to industry of implementing air regulations are still quantified, at least in the new rule. But if the benefits aren't assigned a similarly concrete dollar amount, he says, it is easier to ignore them. ""It looks good only because you ignore the main consequence of the rollback, which is the additional negative impact on public health,"" he says. ""By just saying we are assuming no harm doesn't mean there is no harm.""

The health costs of air pollution

Decades of research have shown that exposure to pollution, such as fine particles, damages people's health. The landmark Harvard University Six Cities study, which ran from the 1970s until the 1990s, showed unambiguously that living in more polluted areas shortened people's lives. Since then, hundreds of research analyses — including many produced by EPA scientists — have linked risks to people's lungs, hearts, and brains with fine particle pollution. And reducing that pollution can have near-instantaneous health benefits: After the closure of a polluting coke plant in Pennsylvania, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory problems dropped dramatically in the surrounding population.

A 1981 executive order from President Ronald Reagan required agencies like the EPA to consider the costs and benefits of major regulations such as the Clean Air Act. So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.

The cost estimates were relatively straightforward: What would it cost industry to upgrade their equipment and processes to comply with a rule? The benefits were slightly trickier. The agency developed sophisticated ways to estimate how many lives would be saved and health problems avoided from lower pollution, driven by tighter regulations. The EPA also developed economic models that could estimate how much money such changes would save the American people.

Most estimates routinely came up with high economic benefit-to-cost ratios, says Rice, the Harvard pulmonologist. ""The Clean Air Act is often cited as having benefit-cost ratios of upward of 30 to 1,"" she says. ""The economic return is so great that even small reductions in pollution, across millions of people, translate into very large savings.""

A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case clarified that agencies like the EPA had to take both benefits and costs into account in their regulatory processes. But the courts have ""not waded into the question of how exactly [EPA] should do that,"" says Jeffrey Holmstead, an EPA expert and lawyer at Bracewell, LLC and former leader of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the George W. Bush administration. ""So, yes, they do have to consider both, but there is no legally enforceable requirement for them to do it in any particular way,"" he says. That leaves it up to the agency's discretion, Holmstead says, whether to forgo an economic benefits calculation, as long as the EPA still assesses the health benefits in some way.

Other EPA regulations, he says, assess the health benefits without assigning a specific dollar value, like some of the rules concerning hazardous air pollutants, which are associated with significant but more uncertain health risks.

However, ""you can't do a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis without trying to monetize both the costs and the benefits,"" Holmstead says. ""This will be the first time in a long time that EPA hasn't tried to provide a monetary benefit to reducing at least PM 2.5 and ozone.""

The move to not consider economic benefits marks a major policy change, says NYU legal expert Revesz. ""It's extraordinarily unusual,"" he says.

Not just air pollution

Revesz points out that under the Trump administration, the EPA has made moves to reconsider the economic benefits of regulations in other areas, as well.

In its proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards, for example, the EPA did not assess the potential economic benefits to consumers who switched to electric vehicles instead of choosing gas-powered cars. It also explicitly declined to calculate societal economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and significantly lowered the estimates of the health savings from tighter rules. The EPA did the same in its efforts to roll back the endangerment finding, which has been in place since 2009. That finding concludes that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere poses serious risks to public health and well-being.

Revesz says that makes three ways the EPA used to consider economic benefits to Americans from regulations. And now the ""EPA has said that it's going to ignore all three of them,"" he says.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a 2025 statement that his priorities at the agency were to ""lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4443x2499+0+231/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2F58%2Feea06c064d10af0de476010fc22c%2Fap19023814163567.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:02:31.950904

This year marks America’s 250th year of independence. One of the trends that has repeatedly shaped the nation’s history is again in the news. As we’re experiencing at Microsoft, AI is the latest in a long line of new technologies to require large-scale infrastructure development.

Microsoft today is launching a new initiative to build what we call Community-First AI Infrastructure—a commitment to do this work differently than some others and to do it responsibly. This commits us to the concrete steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our datacenters. It reflects our sense of civic responsibility as well as a broad and long-term view of what it will take to run a successful AI infrastructure business. In short, we will set a high bar.

As we launch this initiative, we think about it in the context of both the headlines of the day and the lessons from the past. Beginning in the 1770s, the country has advanced through successive eras built on huge infrastructure development based on canals, railroads, power plants, and the electrical grid, followed by the telephone system, highways, and airports. AI infrastructure has become the next chapter in this story.

Like major buildouts of the past, AI infrastructure is expensive and complex. Investments are advancing at a rapid pace. Today, these require large-scale spending by the private sector in land, construction, electricity, liquid cooling, high-bandwidth connectivity, and operations. This revives a longstanding question: how can our nation build transformative infrastructure in a way that strengthens, rather than strains, the local communities where it takes root?

Large AI investments are accelerating just as datacenter concerns are growing in local communities. The pattern is familiar. Whether it was canals, railroads, the electrical grid, or the interstate highway system, each era produced its own conflicts over who bore the burdens of progress. One enduring lesson is that successful infrastructure buildouts will only progress when communities feel that the gains outweigh the costs. Long-term success requires a commitment to address public needs, including by the private companies making these investments.

This must start by understanding local concerns. Residential electricity rates have recently risen in dozens of states, driven in part by several years of inflation, supply chain constraints, and long-overdue grid upgrades. Communities value new jobs and property tax revenue, but not if they come with higher power bills or tighter water supplies. Without addressing these issues directly, even supportive communities will question the role of datacenters in their backyard.

As a company, we believe in the many positive advances AI will bring to America’s future. From stronger economic growth to better medical advances and more affordable products, we believe AI will make a difference in everyday lives. But we also recognize that AI, like other fundamental technological shifts, will create new challenges as well. And we believe that tech companies like Microsoft have both a unique opportunity to help contribute to these advances and a heightened responsibility to address these challenges head-on.

This Community-First AI Infrastructure Initiative provides a framework for doing exactly that. It is anchored in five commitments, each a clear promise to the communities where we build, own, and operate Microsoft datacenters. These are:

We’ll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don’t increase your electricity prices.

We’ll minimize our water use and replenish more of your water than we use.

We’ll create jobs for your residents.

We’ll add to the tax base for your local hospitals, schools, parks, and libraries.

We’ll strengthen your community by investing in local AI training and nonprofits.

We describe our plans in detail below. We recognize that these will evolve and improve, based most importantly on what we learn from ongoing engagement with local communities across the country. We’ll also follow this plan for Community-First AI Infrastructure with similar plans for other countries, shaped to reflect their local needs and traditions.

But we are choosing the beginning of 2026 in Washington, DC to launch this effort in the United States. Our goal is to move quickly, partner with local communities, and bring these commitments to life in the first half of this year.

1.Electricity: We’ll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don’t increase your electricity prices.

There’s no denying that AI consumes large amounts of electricity. While advances in technology may someday change this, today, this is the reality.

The United States will retain its AI leadership role only if AI infrastructure can tap into a rapidly growing supply of electricity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that US datacenter electricity demand will more than triple by 2035, growing from 200 terawatt-hours to 640 terawatt-hours per year. This growth is taking place alongside rapid electrification of manufacturing and other sectors of the economy.

Our nation is addressing this reality at a demanding time. Even in the absence of datacenter construction, the United States is facing major electricity challenges. Much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old, and it’s under strain. Supply chain constraints on transformers and high-voltage equipment are delaying upgrades that would enable existing lines to deliver more electricity. New transmission can take more than 7 to 10 years due to permitting and siting delays. This creates a mismatch with growing electricity demand.

Some have suggested that AI will be so beneficial that the public should help pay for the added electricity the country needs for it. We believe in the benefits AI will create, but we disagree with this approach. Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI. Instead, we believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create.

This will require that we take four steps, and we’re committed to each:

First, we’ll ask utilities and public commissions to set our rates high enough to cover the electricity costs for our datacenters. This includes the costs of adding and using the electricity infrastructure needed for the datacenters we build, own, and operate. We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices. Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers.

In some areas, communities are already starting to benefit from this approach. In Wyoming, for example, Microsoft and Black Hills Energy have developed an innovative utility partnership that ensures our datacenter growth strengthens—rather than burdens—the local community. And as part of our datacenter investment in Wisconsin, we are supporting a new rate structure that would charge “Very Large Customers,” including datacenters, the cost of the electricity required to serve them. This protects residents by preventing those costs from being passed on. But we recognize the need to ensure that datacenter communities benefit everywhere. We believe this approach can and should be a model for other states.

Second, we’ll collaborate early, closely, and transparently with local utilities to add electricity and the supporting infrastructure to the grid when needed for our datacenters. Addressing electricity costs is critical, but it is an incomplete solution for local communities unless we expand electricity supply. This expansion typically requires a complex effort that includes the expansion of electrical generation capacity and improvements in transmission and substation systems.

We’re committed to collaborating with local utilities. We will sit down and plan together, providing early transparency around our projected power requirements and contracting in advance for the electricity we will use. When our datacenter expansion requires improvements in transmission and substation capabilities, we will continue our existing practices by paying for these improvements.

This work will build on a spirit of partnership with utilities we’ve worked to foster across the country. For example, in the wholesale energy market that covers much of the Midwest called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), we have contracted to add 7.9 GW of new electricity generation to the grid, which is more than double our current consumption.

Third, we’ll pursue innovation to make our datacenters more efficient. We are also using AI to reduce energy use and improve the performance of our software and hardware in the design and management of our datacenters. And we are collaborating closely with utilities to leverage tools like AI to improve planning, get more electricity from existing lines and equipment, improve system resilience and durability, and speed the development of new infrastructure, including nuclear energy technologies.

By embedding these innovations into datacenters and by collaborating directly with local utilities, communities gain access to systems that are more efficient, more reliable, and better prepared to support growth without increasing costs for households.

Fourth, we’ll advocate for the state and national public policies needed to support our neighboring communities with affordable, reliable, and sustainable power. Public policy plays an essential role in supporting communities with affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to electricity. In 2022, Microsoft established priorities for electricity policy advocacy: expanding clean electricity generation, modernizing the grid, and engaging local communities. Over the past three years, we have advocated across all three areas and engaged with government leaders at the federal, state, and local levels to do so. To date, however, progress has been uneven. This needs to change.

We will advocate for policies across these areas with an urgent focus on accelerating project permitting and interconnection of electricity projects, expediting the planning and expansion of the electricity grid, and designing new electricity rates for large electricity users.

2. Water: We’ll minimize our water use and replenish more of your water than we use.

Across the country, communities are asking pointed questions about how datacenters use water. These are arising in places already facing water stress, like Phoenix and Atlanta, as well as regions with more abundant supply, like Wisconsin. These concerns are often amplified by aging municipal water systems and infrastructure gaps. Local communities want and deserve reassurance that new AI infrastructure won’t strain their water resources.

Our commitment ensures that our presence will strengthen local water systems rather than burden them. We’ll do this by reducing the amount of water we use and by investing in local water systems and water replenishment projects.

First, we’re committed to reducing the amount of water our datacenters use. The chips that power datacenters produce heat. To manage that heat, datacenters historically relied upon evaporative cooling systems that drew on large volumes of water for cooling in hot weather. As AI workloads have increased, the demand for cooling has increased. The GPU chips that power AI workloads run at very high temperatures; without proper cooling, these chips would burn out within minutes.

The good news is that the tech sector has invested in new innovations to address these cooling needs. Now is the time when we need to step up, use these new technologies, and take added steps to address water use concerns.

Across our entire owned fleet of datacenters, we are committed as a company to a 40 percent improvement in datacenter water-use intensity by 2030. We are optimizing water usage for cooling, improving our ability to balance between water-based cooling and air cooling based on environmental conditions. We have also launched a new AI datacenter design that uses a closed-loop system. By constantly recirculating a cooling liquid, we can dramatically cut our water usage. In this next-generation design, already deployed in locations such as Wisconsin and Georgia, potable water is no longer needed for cooling, reducing pressure on local freshwater systems.

For communities where water infrastructure constraints pose challenges, we will collaborate with local utilities to understand whether current systems can support the additional demand associated with datacenter growth. If sufficient capacity does not exist, we work with our engineering teams to identify solutions that avoid burdening the community.

This approach will build on what we’ve learned from the recent work at our datacenters in Quincy, Washington, an arid region where the local groundwater supply was already under pressure. To avoid drawing from the community’s potable water, we partnered with the city to construct the Quincy Water Reuse Utility, which treats and recirculates datacenter cooling water rather than relying on local groundwater. This approach protects limited drinking-water supplies while ensuring that high-quality, recycled water can be used for datacenter cooling needs. Where future system improvements are required, Microsoft funds those upgrades in full, ensuring that the community doesn’t have to shoulder the cost of supporting our operations.

We also partner with utilities from day one to map out water, wastewater, and pressure needs, and we fully fund the infrastructure required for growth, ensuring local water systems are resilient. Beyond our own footprint, we invest directly in community water infrastructure, modernizing water systems, expanding access, increasing water reliability, and helping utilities maintain stable rates and pressure. For example, near our datacenter in Leesburg, Virginia, Microsoft is funding more than $25 million of water and sewer improvements to ensure the cost of serving our facilities does not fall on local ratepayers.

Second, we will ensure that we replenish more water than we withdraw. This means restoring measurable amounts of water to the same water districts where our datacenter’s water is used, so the total water returned exceeds total water used. This standard provides greater transparency and precision in tracking and reporting, aligned with emerging industry standards.

We will pursue projects that make the most important water contribution to each local community. For example, in the greater Phoenix area and nearby Nevada communities, our leak detection partnerships with local utilities identify and repair hidden breaks in aging water systems, preventing water losses and keeping municipal water in circulation for community use. These projects both add to the total usable water supply and improve the reliability of service for residents.

Across the Midwest, we are restoring historic oxbow wetlands. These are crescent-shaped water bodies that naturally recharge groundwater, reduce flood risk, and enhance habitats for native species. These wetlands act as nature’s reservoirs, capturing and slowly returning water to local aquifers throughout both wet seasons and droughts, creating year-round value for farms, ecosystems, and nearby communities.

Overall, we approach replenishment the same way a household might think about a bank account: our operations make water withdrawals, and our replenishment projects make deposits. Some deposits, like our leak detection projects, go straight into the checking account—depositing water into the municipal supply for immediate community use. Others, like wetland restoration, go into a savings account—investing in the watershed’s long-term capacity to store and supply the region. These projects are evaluated using recognized methods that convert on-the-ground improvements into measurable gallons (or cubic meters) of water restored to local ecosystems, ensuring that commitments reflect tangible local benefits, not abstract promises.

Third, we will support this work with greater local transparency. People deserve to know how much water our datacenters use, and we are committed to making that information accessible, clear, and easy to understand. Aligned with this goal, we will begin publishing water-use data for each datacenter region in the country, as well as our progress on replenishment. This approach will ensure that communities can understand both our operational footprint and the progress we are making against our water-positive goals.

Fourth, we will advocate for public policies to help minimize water use and strengthen resilience. This means championing policies that enable sustainable growth while safeguarding community resources. We will support state and federal efforts to make reclaimed and industrial recycled water the default supply for datacenters wherever feasible. We will advocate for harmonized transparency standards that allow communities to clearly understand water use and stewardship practices. And we will work to reduce permitting delays by promoting predictable pathways for water-efficient datacenter projects.

These actions reflect our belief that technology and environmental responsibility must advance together, ensuring that AI-driven progress aligns with long-term water resilience for people, places, and ecosystems. Our policy activities are rooted in protecting local communities. By prioritizing recycled water and efficiency, we will help reduce pressure on aging municipal systems and ensure reliable water access for people and businesses.

3.We’ll create jobs for your residents.

New datacenters create jobs—typically thousands during construction and hundreds during operations. For example, in Washington state more than 1,300 skilled trades workers are building Microsoft datacenters and by the end of next year more than 650 full-time employees and contractors will work across all our operational facilities there.

One of our goals is to help ensure that workers from the local community benefit from these opportunities. To achieve this, we will invest in new partnerships to help give local residents the skills and opportunities to fill these jobs in both the construction and operational phases.

The AI infrastructure construction boom is driving large-scale physical development, creating a huge demand for skilled tradespeople nationwide. As datacenters and the energy projects that support them grow quickly, firms are vying for a limited workforce. At one level, this is good news for people who already have the qualifications these jobs require. But at another level, there is a risk the jobs will not go to local residents who want to pursue these jobs unless they can acquire the skills required.

We will take a multifaceted approach.

First, we will invest in partnerships to help train local workers to support the construction and maintenance of datacenters. This includes a new and first-of-its-kind partnership between Microsoft and North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) to strengthen apprenticeship and training programs in the skilled trades where datacenters are being built. We are launching today a new agreement that establishes a cooperative framework to focus on building a pipeline of skilled workers in regions where we are building datacenters. This will also help enable NABTU to identify qualified contractor partners to bid on our infrastructure projects.

Second, we will expand our Datacenter Academy program to train individuals to fill ongoing datacenter operations roles. This program works in partnership with local community colleges and vocational schools to train students for critical roles in datacenter operations and related careers, once construction is complete.

A good example of this work is our Datacenter Academy partnerships in Boydton, Virginia, where we have a large datacenter campus. The Academy works with Southside Virginia Community College and the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center, which have helped hundreds of students and adult learners earn industry-recognized certifications in information technology and critical facilities operations.

In 2024, this work expanded with the opening of a new Critical Environment Training Lab (SoVA) in South Hill. This provides hands-on training with electrical, mechanical, and cooling systems using decommissioned datacenter equipment donated by Microsoft. Graduates of these programs have gone on to pursue careers supporting datacenter operations in Southern Virginia, including roles with Microsoft and the broader ecosystem of companies that help operate and maintain digital infrastructure. We will pursue similar partnerships in other states, and we are committed to making this an ongoing part of our work in the communities where we build new datacenters.

Third, we will use our voice to encourage policymakers to support these new job opportunities. While this work is of heightened importance in communities with datacenters, the broader need for this type of skilled labor is national in scope. According to LinkedIn data, job postings for data center occupations or requiring at least one core data center skill, such as data center operations, grew by 23 percent globally and 13.5 percent in the US year-over-year in 2025. This is likely to represent an ongoing trend. Over the next decade, trillions in private investment will offer steady employment opportunities for American workers—including electricians, pipefitters, HVAC techs, welders, and construction crews—alongside manufacturing technicians for related components, like chips, power generation, and cooling systems.

However, this rapid demand for skilled labor is set to outpace the available pipeline of workers. Today, the Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that the construction industry is short roughly 439,000 workers, mostly among skilled workers who do things like lay pipe and wire electrical panels.[1] Manufacturers report shortages as well, with the CEO of Ford Motor Company recently highlighting 5,000 open mechanic jobs that pay more than $100,000 per year. And for datacenter operations, employers face shortages in hands-on infrastructure skills such as cabling, racking, and network hardware.

This problem is exacerbated by the demographics of an aging workforce and a decades-old policy trend of deprioritizing vocational education for young Americans. A generation of skilled workers, vocationally trained in high schools and apprenticeships in the 20th century, are retiring from the trades. In the first quarter-century of the 21st century, high schools pivoted towards preparing young people for higher education and advanced degrees, often at the expense of traditional shop classes and training in skilled craftsmanship.

The increased demand for skilled trades, paired with an aging workforce, requires an enhanced public-private workforce partnership. Secondary schools in the US can be incentivized to do more to educate young people about the trades through vocational schools and pre-apprenticeship programs. Registered apprenticeship programs offered nationally provide a fulfilling career path with long-term wages and benefits.

In partnership with labor, the federal government can champion a national apprenticeship and workforce development initiative that helps young and aspiring American workers near AI infrastructure projects, especially in rural and post-industrial regions. President Trump’s AI Action Plan rightly identifies this opportunity, and we will work closely with the Department of Labor to help scale this effort. The federal government can also help by streamlining the process by which businesses can establish and maintain a registered apprenticeship program. They can also maximize the use of existing federal dollars that directly support registered apprenticeship programs. This could entail modernizing the regulations for the National Apprenticeship Act or updating the statutory language itself.

4.We will add to the tax base for your local hospitals, schools, parks, and libraries.

One of the most tangible benefits from datacenter development is invisible to an individual driving nearby. It’s the property taxes paid by datacenters to the local municipality, which are substantial. But this too requires that the private sector take a responsible approach, as described below.

We won’t ask local municipalities to reduce their local property tax rates when we buy land or propose a datacenter presence. Instead, we’ll pay our full and fair share of local property taxes, adding revenue to local towns and cities. This is obviously critical to supporting the growth a local community often experiences when datacenters are built or expanded. And most importantly, at a time when many communities are facing revenue shortages that threaten vital public assets like hospitals, schools, parks, and libraries, we know from experience that this can make a big difference.

The benefits of this approach are nowhere more apparent than in Quincy, Washington, a small agricultural community about 150 miles east of Seattle where Microsoft built its first datacenter in 2008. Since then, we have built more than twenty datacenters in the area, providing ongoing employment to thousands of construction workers for almost two decades. Hundreds of technicians enjoy permanent jobs in those datacenters, earning salaries well above the median income for Quincy. And we estimate that for every direct construction job created, another one is created in related sectors, including security services, maintenance and repair, retail, restaurants, and more. Altogether, our datacenters drive more than $200 million in regional economic activity each year.

As a result, the share of Quincy residents living below the poverty line has been cut in half, dropping from 29.4 percent in 2013 to 13.1 percent in 2023. And county property tax revenues have more than tripled over the past two decades, from roughly $60 million to more than $180 million. This has enabled the city to invest in public services and amenities. Last year, as rural hospitals around the country cut back on critical care offerings and shuttered their doors, Quincy opened a new 54,000-square-foot medical center. The city has also made substantial renovations to its high school, adding state-of-the-art athletic facilities, an auditorium, and a career and technical training department.

We want to make sure that the other communities where our datacenters are located benefit from our presence in the same way. In all the regions where we build, own, and operate datacenters, we’re devoted to taking a civically responsible approach. This means recognizing the importance of civic services, including public safety, local healthcare, schools, libraries, and parks. As we become an important local employer, local communities can count on us to be a constructive contributor to local business and civic efforts.

5. We’ll strengthen your community by investing in local AI training and nonprofits.

We believe the datacenter communities that power AI should be among the first to benefit from it. As these communities help drive innovation and economic growth for the nation, it’s essential that they share in the economic, educational, and community benefits AI is creating. Especially as jobs evolve and require more AI skills, this requires local investments in AI education and training. To support this goal, we will provide free, age-appropriate, best-in-class AI training and education in these communities in partnership with trusted, local community-based organizations.

For years, we have been helping people gain essential digital skills in communities in and around our datacenters, such as Quincy in Eastern Washington, Boydton in Southern Virginia, and Mt. Pleasant in Southeast Wisconsin. One thing we’ve learned is that these communities have vibrant anchor institutions—schools, libraries, and local chambers of commerce—that form the backbone of local learning, workforce development, and economic growth. That’s why our approach as we go forward will be to invest in communities with our datacenters to partner with and provide support to these anchor institutions so that every community member can leverage the power of AI in how they live, work, and learn.

First, we will partner with local K-12 schools, community colleges, and universities to provide age-appropriate, responsible AI literacy training and learning experiences for students and teachers in our datacenter communities. This will build on some of our most recent experiences. For example, in Quincy, Washington, we partnered with Quincy High School and the local FFA chapter to teach students the critical AI and data skills needed for careers in precision agriculture. And in our datacenter region in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, we recently launched an AI bootcamp for students and faculty with Gateway Technical College to cultivate a new generation of developers and creators of AI tools and technology across Wisconsin technical colleges.

Our commitment is to build on this work to help students and teachers responsibly and effectively engage with AI, create with AI, manage AI, and design with AI by bringing free, locally relevant, responsible AI training that is aligned with AI literacy standards to students in every K-12 school, community college, and university in our datacenter markets.

Second, we will support adults in our datacenter communities with AI tools and skills by creating neighborhood AI learning hubs in partnership with local libraries in our key datacenter markets. This approach will build upon our previous digital skilling partnerships with local libraries. For example, during COVID, we partnered with libraries in rural communities across the country, and more recently, we helped train libraries in our Quincy and Mt. Pleasant datacenter markets on AI so that they could help their patrons learn AI skills. Building on this work, we will invest in AI literacy skills development for librarians and provide access to free AI literacy training and certifications to local library patrons, including by equipping public terminals at local libraries in our datacenter regions with AI tools and services.

Third, we will support AI skills training for small businesses. We recognize that AI training will be critical for small businesses as they navigate the transition to the AI economy. These businesses are the backbone of local economies, and their success directly impacts job creation, workforce stability, and community vitality. Through a new workforce transformation initiative, we will deliver AI training, tools, and insights to local chambers of commerce that support these small businesses. We will also provide flexible grants for AI training and upskilling to local chambers of commerce and a variety of workforce organizations to help local businesses upskill employees, adopt AI responsibly, and prepare their workforce for ongoing transformation—ensuring that economic opportunity stays rooted in the communities where we build and operate datacenters.

Finally, we will invest in your local nonprofit community. A defining aspect of Microsoft’s own history and culture has long been a commitment to support the many nonprofit organizations that are vital to every community the company calls home. As we expand our datacenters in new communities, we’re committed to bringing this role to these new regions.

This starts with support for our employees in the local community. We provide two key benefits to all our full-time employees. First, we will match every hour they spend volunteering for a nonprofit with a donation to that group of $25. Second, we’ll match each dollar they donate to a nonprofit with an equal donation by Microsoft. These give all our employees, including in our datacenters, a total potential match of $15,000 each year.

This approach to community engagement is an important part of Microsoft’s culture, and it has become the largest nonprofit charitable matching program in the history of business. In 2024 in the United States, it raised $229.1 million in donations for 29,000 nonprofits, plus 964,000 volunteer hours contributed by our employees. It’s a part of Microsoft we’re excited to bring to the communities that have our datacenters.

We recognize that our support for the local community also needs to go beyond this type of program. Our broader contribution must start with listening. You know best what your town needs, what nonprofits are making a difference, and which organizations are best positioned to do more. We will provide locally based Microsoft liaisons in major US datacenter communities to work side by side with local leaders and nonprofits. Our local staff will provide a community connection to our various Microsoft teams and resources. Working together, we will shape our direction and connection to help further our support for local nonprofits.

Conclusion

Many lessons emerge from the nation’s 250-year history relating to technology and infrastructure. The first is that large-scale infrastructure expansion is vital to economic growth and everyday improvements in people’s lives. Our lives today rely on electrical appliances, automobiles, phones, airplanes, and much more that would be impossible without modern infrastructure.

But a second lesson illustrates an important tension. Major infrastructure expansion is always difficult. It’s expensive. It inevitably raises questions, concerns, and even controversies. This has been true for more than 200 years, and we should assume it will be true well into the future. This always requires that important decisions be made by government leaders from village presidents and town councils to the American President and Congress.

Third, the most important decisions are often made at the local level. This reflects the outsized impact—both positive and negative—of infrastructure expansion at the local level. It also reflects the American political tradition and our zoning and permitting laws, which rightly put decision-making authority closest to those elected to serve local communities.

There’s a final lesson that speaks most directly to us. Private companies can help by stepping up and acting in a responsible way. We cannot surmount inevitable community challenges by ourselves. But we can make everything easier by embracing a long-term vision. By recognizing our responsibility. By playing a constructive role. And by supporting the entire community.

As we look to the future, we are committing to taking this final lesson to heart. And making it a fundamental part of our efforts every day.

The programmes from the legislation will also require utilities to promote energy equity for low-income households.

Moreover, the CRGA aims to drive the clean energy economy, create new jobs and accelerate the creation of new energy projects across the state.

This will be achieved through the search for new clean energy opportunities by directing the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) to propose long-term procurement agreements; establishing a Solar Bill of Rights that would ensure citizens served by municipal and cooperative utilities have the possibility to install rooftop solar panels or extend clean energy siting reforms for energy storage projects, too.

The Illinois General Assembly passed the bill in October last year ahead of it going to Pritzker to be signed into law. The energy storage target will see resources deployed or contracted for by 31 December 2030, and the bill directs state authorities to also conduct energy storage procurements by electric utilities. The Act, including the energy storage target, was warmly welcomed by consumer and environmental advocacy groups as well as clean energy industry trade bodies as it passed the state legislature, as reported by Energy-Storage.news.

The legislation will also benefit community solar development in Illinois with the increase of the maximum size for these projects to 10MW. The state passed its first community solar legislation in 2016 and has since then seen 444MW of new community solar capacity in the state up until Q3 2025, according to data from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Illinois is one of the leading states in terms of community solar installations and ranks fifth among states with community solar development.

JB Pritzker, said: “The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard in the effort to lower energy costs and marks a historic step forward in our clean energy vision. Once again, Illinois is stepping up where the federal government is failing.

Illinois is among the US states with the highest growth projection in the coming years, according to trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA forecasts 14.6GW of new solar PV over the next five years, the fourth most across all US states. This would more than double Illinois current installed solar PV which sat at 6.5GW at the end of the third quarter of 2025.

This preconceptual design review marks the completion of the final major milestone in the DOE’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program (“the Milestone Program”), and Thea Energy is the first awardee company to receive certification of its pilot plant design.

The Milestone Program launched in with $46 million in funding across eight private fusion companies to support progress on the path to commercial power plants.

Modeled after the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, essential in launching the private space industry, the Milestone Program supports companies focused on grid-scale power through non-dilutive capital and external validation, where funds are only paid when key milestones that de-risk fusion technologies are completed and approved by a review panel.

The U.S. DOE approved completion of the Helios preconceptual design following a detailed report review by independent experts from national laboratories, research institutions and universities focused on fusion.

Members of the DOE review team visited Thea Energy’s headquarters in Kearny as part of the certification. Reviewers focused on comprehensively validating that the company has a system architecture and a robust path toward deploying a fusion power plant.

Other disclosed milestones completed by Thea Energy since selection in 2023 include the successful performance of the world’s first superconducting planar coil magnet array and the down selection to a family of stellarator plasma configurations.

“This final design milestone, now certified by the DOE, substantiates the validity of the planar coil stellarator and shows a clear pathway to a deployable power plant,” said Brian Berzin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Thea Energy. “Practicality, conservatism and engineering margins are emphasized in Helios, and the DOE has recognized those differentiators in this design.

“The Helios preconceptual design reflects decades of specialized expertise, now vetted and confirmed by fusion leaders and foremost technical authorities. This significant approval allows us to definitively communicate confidence in this design to the interested power offtakers and hyperscalers that we are in conversations with.

“Working with the DOE across this milestone, and eight prior, ensured team Thea approached each cornerstone with rigor, scrutiny and thoroughness. Now is the time to prioritize fusion and the teams driving meaningful progress, and we strongly support the expansion of the Milestone Program to align with the industry’s commercialization goals.”

“The inaugural period of the Milestone Program’s goal is to see companies demonstrate critical underlying technologies while on the path to a preconceptual fusion pilot plant design,” said Jean Paul Allain, Ph.D., associate director for fusion energy sciences in the DOE Office of Science.

“Thea Energy tackled key milestones swiftly and enthusiastically leading to this in-depth design for a modernized stellarator system — summarized in a 200-page report to the DOE. The Milestone Program mandates a heightened level of accountability from awardees, and we look forward to seeing Thea Energy’s continued momentum.”

Thea Energy is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s following Eos, its large-scale demonstration system that will create power-plant-relevant, steady-state fusion. Eos will directly benefit from the breakthroughs highlighted in the company’s Helios design and is scheduled to be online by 2030.

Last month, New York State officials adopted the 2025 State Energy Plan, which will guide energy policy and investment decisions for the next 15 years. This is the state’s first energy plan since the passage of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019 – a landmark law that commits New York to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

Because state agencies must align their decisions with the Energy Plan, it represents an important opportunity to drive full implementation of the CLCPA. In fact, state law explicitly requires the SEP to incorporate the Climate Action Council’s 2022 Scoping Plan – the state’s roadmap for achieving its climate targets through a managed, equitable energy transition.

Instead, the final plan falls short

The SEP ignores key Scoping Plan recommendations, under-prioritizes the most affordable clean energy solutions and doubles down on costly, polluting fossil infrastructure. It embraces an “all of the above” fallacy that fails to center clean energy – despite clear evidence that these solutions deliver long-term financial benefits while reducing health and environmental harms.

New York’s state energy plan falls short Share on X

As written, the SEP puts New York’s energy system on a trajectory that is incompatible with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The state’s own modeling shows that emissions between 2030 and 2040 exceed levels consistent with a net-zero pathway, regardless of whether emissions are measured using CLCPA or conventional United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change accounting.

The state leaves billions on the table

New Yorks’s own modeling also makes the consequences of this failure unmistakable. A Net-Zero Pathway strategy could generate up to $35 billion in net benefits by 2040, from avoided health costs – like reductions in nonfatal heart attacks, asthma-related ER visits and lost workdays – and reduced climate damages. By contrast, the SEP’s chosen planning scenario delivers only $18 billion in net benefits – roughly half of what the state could achieve by committing fully to net zero.

The plan omits one of the state’s most powerful tools

Most glaringly, the SEP excludes a commitment to cap-and-invest regulations – known as the Clean Air Initiative – despite the Scoping Plan identifying such a program as a core strategy for meeting New York’s emissions limits. Cap-and-invest is projected to generate at least $3 billion every year to invest in programs that lower energy bills, create good jobs and deliver major health benefits, especially in communities burdened by air pollution. After years of policy development and stakeholder engagement, the program is ready for implementation. Its absence from the SEP underscores the plan’s failure to meet New York’s climate and affordability promises.

Clean energy saves New Yorkers money – if the state acts

The SEP itself acknowledges that efficiency and electrification deliver significant cost savings. State modeling shows that by 2031, households prioritizing high-efficiency electrification could save an average of $175 per month on combined energy and transportation costs – with savings reaching up to $335 per month for some households.

The SEP also recognizes that policies reducing upfront costs and adoption barriers are essential to realizing these savings and alleviating energy insecurity and burdens. That is exactly what cap-and-invest revenue is designed to do – scale investments in weatherization, public transit and efficient electric appliances and vehicles so that all New Yorkers can benefit.

Last year’s state budget took an important step by allocating $1 billion to clean energy and efficiency programs through the Sustainable Future Program. But one-time funding is not enough. To deliver lasting savings, healthier schools and homes and family-sustaining jobs, the state must sustain and scale these investments – including another $1 billion commitment in the FY2027 budget, followed by cap-and-invest.

Where the plan gets it right

The SEP does include several constructive elements that state agencies should embrace:

It exercises caution around “differentiated,” or “certified,” natural gas programs and indicates a pathway to further assess responsible utilization of this emissions mitigation tool.

It rejects blending hydrogen into the natural gas system due to safety concerns.

It promotes the development of thermal energy networks, a critical component of the clean energy transition.

It warns against double-counting environmental attributes associated with “renewable” natural gas credits sold out of state.

While these provisions matter, they do not compensate for the SEP’s broader failure to prioritize clean energy at the scale and speed that the climate crisis demands.

New York must close the gap

New Yorkers deserve clean air, affordable energy, healthy communities, and a livable future. The CLCPA – passed with broad statewide support – can deliver on all of this. But only if the state follows through.

Especially now, in the face of federal opposition to thoughtful policy, New York cannot afford to retreat. The State Energy Plan does not reflect the clean energy future New Yorkers have demanded. State agencies must act now to close the gap and put the state back on track to meet its climate commitments.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//NY-SEP-Blog-Image.png,N,,2026-01-13 10:12:50.809072

Although these nameplates rely primarily on internal-combustion engines, Subaru said it positioned them within a broader Subaru electrification strategy.
The program continues to support customer engagement and community giving as Subaru balances near-term sales pressure with long-term electrification goals, Subaru said.","Subaru of America closed 2025 amid a broader industry slowdown while continuing to advance its Subaru electrification strategy. The automaker said it expanded its mix of hybrid and fully electric vehicles as it worked through market headwinds.

Subaru reported 57,437 vehicle sales in December 2025. That total marked a 7.2% decline compared with December 2024. For the full calendar year, Subaru delivered 643,591 vehicles, down 3.6% year over year.

Company leadership pointed to electrified powertrains as a core priority. Jeff Walters, president and chief operating officer of Subaru of America, said the company remained focused on “expanding our versatile lineup of models offering gas, hybrid, and fully electric options.” He also thanked retailers for their support during the transition of Forester assembly to Subaru of Indiana Automotive.

Solterra Reflects Subaru Electrification Strategy

Subaru’s fully electric Solterra posted lower volumes in 2025. The model recorded 498 sales in December, down from 1,165 units in the same month last year.

For the full year, Solterra sales totaled 10,715 vehicles. That figure declined from 12,447 units in 2024, based on the company’s reported data.

Despite the decline, Solterra remains Subaru’s only fully electric vehicle. The model anchors the brand’s current EV efforts as Subaru prepares additional electrified launches.

Core Nameplates Support Broader Strategy

Subaru’s best-selling carline in 2025 was Crosstrek, it said. The model achieved its best year ever with 191,724 sales. That result marked a 5.5% increase over 2024.

Forester followed with 175,070 annual sales. Outback reached 157,716 units for the year.

In its final full year of sales, Legacy delivered 22,212 units. That total represented a 13.4% increase year over year.

Although these nameplates rely primarily on internal-combustion engines, Subaru said it positioned them within a broader Subaru electrification strategy. The approach blends traditional powertrains with hybrid and fully electric options.

Preparing for an Electrified Future

Troy Poston, senior vice president of sales at Subaru of America, said retailers are preparing for the 2026 lineup. The upcoming models include the all-new Trailseeker and Uncharted.

Health experts worry that the move could lead to rollbacks of air pollution rules, which could result in rising pollution levels, leading to more health risks for millions of Americans.
The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz.
The health costs of air pollution Decades of research have shown that exposure to pollution, such as fine particles, damages people's health.
So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.","For years, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a dollar value to the lives saved and the health problems avoided through many of its environmental regulations.

Now, that has changed. The EPA will no longer consider the economic cost of harm to human health from fine particles and ozone, two air pollutants that are known to affect human health. The change was written into a new rule recently published by the agency. It weakened air pollution rules on power plant turbines that burn fossil fuels, which are sources of air pollution of many types, including from fine particles, sometimes called soot.

The EPA writes in its regulatory impact analysis for the new rule that, for now, the agency will not consider the dollar value of health benefits from its regulations on fine particles and ozone because there is too much uncertainty in estimates of those economic impacts.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch clarified that the agency is still considering health benefits. But it will not assign a dollar amount to those benefits until further notice, as it reconsiders the way it assesses those numbers.

Health experts worry that the move could lead to rollbacks of air pollution rules, which could result in rising pollution levels, leading to more health risks for millions of Americans.

""I'm worried about what this could mean for health,"" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist and air pollution expert at Harvard University and the director of Harvard's Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment. ""Especially for people with chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD, for kids whose lungs are still developing, and for older people, who are especially susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution on the heart, lungs and the brain.""

Fine particles, known as PM2.5, come from a variety of sources, including power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and gas. Long-term exposure to fine particle pollution is known to cause significant health risks, from higher rates of asthma to more heart attacks to dementia, and even premature death. Cleaning up pollution from fine particles has, by the agency's previous estimates, saved more than 230,000 lives and billions of dollars per year in recent years.

The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz. The economic costs to industry of implementing air regulations are still quantified, at least in the new rule. But if the benefits aren't assigned a similarly concrete dollar amount, he says, it is easier to ignore them. ""It looks good only because you ignore the main consequence of the rollback, which is the additional negative impact on public health,"" he says. ""By just saying we are assuming no harm doesn't mean there is no harm.""

The health costs of air pollution

Decades of research have shown that exposure to pollution, such as fine particles, damages people's health. The landmark Harvard University Six Cities study, which ran from the 1970s until the 1990s, showed unambiguously that living in more polluted areas shortened people's lives. Since then, hundreds of research analyses — including many produced by EPA scientists — have linked risks to people's lungs, hearts, and brains with fine particle pollution. And reducing that pollution can have near-instantaneous health benefits: After the closure of a polluting coke plant in Pennsylvania, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory problems dropped dramatically in the surrounding population.

A 1981 executive order from President Ronald Reagan required agencies like the EPA to consider the costs and benefits of major regulations such as the Clean Air Act. So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.

The cost estimates were relatively straightforward: What would it cost industry to upgrade their equipment and processes to comply with a rule? The benefits were slightly trickier. The agency developed sophisticated ways to estimate how many lives would be saved and health problems avoided from lower pollution, driven by tighter regulations. The EPA also developed economic models that could estimate how much money such changes would save the American people.

Most estimates routinely came up with high economic benefit-to-cost ratios, says Rice, the Harvard pulmonologist. ""The Clean Air Act is often cited as having benefit-cost ratios of upward of 30 to 1,"" she says. ""The economic return is so great that even small reductions in pollution, across millions of people, translate into very large savings.""

A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case clarified that agencies like the EPA had to take both benefits and costs into account in their regulatory processes. But the courts have ""not waded into the question of how exactly [EPA] should do that,"" says Jeffrey Holmstead, an EPA expert and lawyer at Bracewell, LLC and former leader of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the George W. Bush administration. ""So, yes, they do have to consider both, but there is no legally enforceable requirement for them to do it in any particular way,"" he says. That leaves it up to the agency's discretion, Holmstead says, whether to forgo an economic benefits calculation, as long as the EPA still assesses the health benefits in some way.

Other EPA regulations, he says, assess the health benefits without assigning a specific dollar value, like some of the rules concerning hazardous air pollutants, which are associated with significant but more uncertain health risks.

However, ""you can't do a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis without trying to monetize both the costs and the benefits,"" Holmstead says. ""This will be the first time in a long time that EPA hasn't tried to provide a monetary benefit to reducing at least PM 2.5 and ozone.""

The move to not consider economic benefits marks a major policy change, says NYU legal expert Revesz. ""It's extraordinarily unusual,"" he says.

Not just air pollution

Revesz points out that under the Trump administration, the EPA has made moves to reconsider the economic benefits of regulations in other areas, as well.

In its proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards, for example, the EPA did not assess the potential economic benefits to consumers who switched to electric vehicles instead of choosing gas-powered cars. It also explicitly declined to calculate societal economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and significantly lowered the estimates of the health savings from tighter rules. The EPA did the same in its efforts to roll back the endangerment finding, which has been in place since 2009. That finding concludes that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere poses serious risks to public health and well-being.

Revesz says that makes three ways the EPA used to consider economic benefits to Americans from regulations. And now the ""EPA has said that it's going to ignore all three of them,"" he says.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a 2025 statement that his priorities at the agency were to ""lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.""

“The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said.
“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.
“To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities.
“This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.

When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2021, authorizing more than $11 billion in new funding to reclaim lands and waterways damaged by abandoned coal mines, the people who lead this work on the ground were ecstatic.

“We were to the moon,” said Amanda Pitzer, the executive director at Friends of the Cheat, a nonprofit organization in West Virginia that works to restore the Cheat River watershed. “Once that big influx of money was announced, with West Virginia on track to receive $2.1 billion over those 15 years, we thought, ‘Now’s the time. Now’s the time to invest in water treatment.’”

But Congress wants to claw back some of that funding.

Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that would withdraw $500 million of the money allocated in 2021 for abandoned mine cleanup projects. The states that stand to lose the most are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, according to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, an environmental organization that works on conservation issues in central and southern Appalachia. The bill must still pass the Senate, which plans to take it up this week, and be signed by the president before it becomes law.

“We’re horribly disappointed,” Pitzer said. “Less money means less reclamation, period.” Among the projects that Pitzer’s organization champions are the building and maintenance of treatment systems that clean up acid mine drainage, a type of pollution that harms aquatic wildlife.

Federal budget bill would raid fund for cleaning up abandoned coal mines

In West Virginia, she said, Abandoned Mine Land funding has also been used to help build public water lines in communities where pollution has affected drinking water supplies. Although significant progress has been made in cleaning up the Cheat River since the 1990s, much more work remains to be done, Pitzer said.

The House bill proposes using the siphoned funding to pay for wildland fire management and U.S. Forest Service operations. “I think it’s highly inappropriate of Congress to rob Peter to pay Paul,” said Andy McAllister, the regional coordinator of the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.

McAllister was particularly upset about the “yes” votes from Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation in the House. All but one member voted for the bill.

Pennsylvania has the most abandoned mines of any state, McAllister said. Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania have created a range of environmental and public safety problems, from underground fires and subsidence to sinkholes and pollution affecting more than 5,500 miles of waterways.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimated it would need $5 billion to fully remediate abandoned mine lands and the waterways they contaminated. Forty-five of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are impacted.

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.

Experts are worried that this “repurposing” of the fund could continue beyond this year, with Congress dipping into the money for other reasons. “The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said. “It just feels very shortsighted.”

Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices, said his group assumes that passing this bill will lead to an annual reduction in funding. Zedack and McAllister said they have not heard back from legislators they’ve reached out to with their concerns.

The offices of Pennsylvania’s senators, Republican Dave McCormick and Democrat John Fetterman, did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News.

Zedack and McAllister both pointed out that the loss of funding will harm local economies. Unremediated mine land can’t be used for development, for example.

“Projects that are funded through this provide jobs in historically depressed areas,” McAllister said. Those opportunities can help to offset job losses from the declining coal industry.

Joe Pizarchik, the former head of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which oversees AML funding, grew up in western Pennsylvania. The region is also losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue, he said. Many waterways are so impaired by mining pollution that they can’t be used for fishing or recreation.

Pizarchik said this isn’t the first time the federal government has reduced the funding available to help communities in coal country since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was first passed in 1977.

“There was a fee put in place on every ton of coal produced to help clean up the messes of the past,” he said. Over time, the fees have shrunk. “Congress is taking back money again to continue to punish the impoverished communities that have been suffering for a century,” he said.

“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. “To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities. We are living the impacts of this legacy.”

Pitzer agreed. “The program was initially structured to collect a fee to pay for sins of the past, and that money should stay in coal country. It should not be redirected to other needs and other places,” Pitzer said. “This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lick-Run-Sept-2019-2-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:02:12.821455

“It is a perfect, wild storm,” said Christy McGillivray, a former Sierra Club Michigan lobbyist who helped push for stronger regulations around the centers in the state.
The levels of political pushback vary from calls for a moratorium on new datacenters to raising concerns in public statements.
At the state level, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has proposed a sweeping set of measures that aim to protect residents from exploitation by big tech datacenters and AI.
Trump, who is closely allied with big tech, is attempting to stop states from regulating data centers.","In late October, an unlikely coalition formed to fiercely oppose controversial plans for more than a dozen Michigan datacenters – rightwing “Stop the Steal” activists joined forces with groups like the Democratic Socialists of America, and people of all political stripes in between.

Polling showed just 28% of residents supported new datacenters, and, amid the furor, Michigan state congressman Dylan Wegela introduced a bill to repeal datacenter tax credits. Despite an opportunity for what looked like an easy political win, the bill has few co-sponsors, is unlikely to move in the state house, and most datacenter plans are poised to be built.

Wegela in part attributed the tepid legislative response to “a lack of political courage” from other politicians.

But the situation in Michigan is emblematic of the broader dynamics unfolding around datacenters in the US. The centers are often so widely loathed across the political spectrum that they are bringing together people who can agree on little else, and the issue has been dubbed “the great unifier”.

Despite this, there has been scant political opposition or action among many Democrats or Republicans – why?

In short, there is a very powerful confluence of forces pushing for datacenters, advocates say.

“It is a perfect, wild storm,” said Christy McGillivray, a former Sierra Club Michigan lobbyist who helped push for stronger regulations around the centers in the state.

Among other issues, national Republican and Democrat leadership are jockeying for big tech’s financial favor in the wake of an election cycle in which the sector shattered spending records as it shifted from leaning left to right.

Meanwhile, those who benefit most from centers represent a potent political force: big tech, the fossil fuel industry, utility companies and the AFL-CIO are allied in support of datacenters and the claims of new jobs they might create. At the same time, the political establishment has made AI expansion a national security issue, and some pro-business Democrats in Michigan are driven by purported economic development.

Moreover, the problems are relatively new, and many Congress members are not yet educated enough on the issue, industry observers say.

The grassroots opposition stems from fears that the centers would increase energy bills, deplete water sources, destroy communities’ rural character, pollute, and cause more fossil fuel to be built. The centers, which house AI infrastructure, create very few jobs, and AI is in part designed to eliminate many jobs.

With state and federal lawmakers largely in support, David v Goliath fights are playing out at the local level across the US, often pitting working- and middle-class residents of all political backgrounds against the interests of tech oligarchs.

McGillivray said state and federal inaction risks further alienating people at a fragile time in US democracy.

“It’s incredibly dangerous for elected officials to feed into the perception that democratic governance cannot do what the vast majority of people want,” McGillivray said.

The levels of political pushback vary from calls for a moratorium on new datacenters to raising concerns in public statements. Many of those taking action are from the Democratic party’s left wing – though not all.

Over the last month, at the federal level, Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib called for a moratorium, while others like Senators Ed Markey, Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Congressman Ro Khanna called for stricter regulations or investigations.

At the state level, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has proposed a sweeping set of measures that aim to protect residents from exploitation by big tech datacenters and AI. Virginia’s Democratic governor, Abigail Spanberger, made capping utility bills a campaign focus in 2025.

Still, the scattered response does not match the issue’s speed or depth, advocates say. That is in part because many politicians do not yet understand how the centers impact on communities, or grasp the breadth of the opposition, said Michelle Deatrick, chair of the Democratic National Committee’s Climate Council, who works on datacenter issues in Congress.

“It’s all happening really fast, and at the national level, a lot of elected leaders I meet with just don’t know that much yet,” Deatrick said.

They added that they expect that more candidates – incumbents and challengers – will begin making datacenters a campaign issue as the midterm races heat up throughout 2026.

Educating lawmakers is in part the goal of a Food And Water Watch-spearheaded campaign. In December, it sent a letter signed by over 230 consumer and environmental protection groups to Congress members demanding a moratorium.

The campaign is also trying to connect local grassroots opposition to harness that energy and direct it at lawmakers, said Jim Walsh, policy director for Food and Water Watch.

“We need to put a halt to more datacenters while policymakers put policies in place that won’t adversely affect people,” Walsh said.

The broader issue, he added, is money in politics. Tech oligarchs spent about $240m supporting Republicans and just $52m supporting Democrats last session, a Guardian analysis of federal records found. Democratic leadership is viewed as tiptoeing around tech leaders who they want to win back.

“The political system is dominated by big money interests that have spent millions of dollars to try to brush these issues, like energy costs, under the rug,” Walsh said. He noted that the Republican party has control over Congress and the White House, and it drives policy. Trump, who is closely allied with big tech, is attempting to stop states from regulating data centers.

Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO has complicated the issue for Democrats. The union’s leadership typically supports projects for which the organization would benefit, even if it is widely opposed by the public. Advocates in Michigan said stronger regulations and consumer protections would be in place had the AFL-CIO not opposed them.

Advocates also say some Democrats’ tepid response is part of a broader problem with the party – an engrained unwillingness to take bold action on major problems.

“There’s almost no risk involved in embracing this issue, so it’s like it’s a cultural thing from the party’s top leaders,” Deatrick said.

The inaction in Congress has pushed the battles to the state level. In Georgia, a Democrat candidate for the state’s public utility commission, which regulates datacenters’ energy use, won in a landslide October upset, in part because he campaigned on stronger regulation of the industry.

In Michigan, Oracle and OpenAI are proposing a datacenter backed by the Trump administration and the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer. The companies and government would invest about $7bn, and Whitmer and other pro-business Democrats have touted it as the largest project in state history, and a massive economic win.

But it is receiving potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in state and federal tax breaks, and would create very few jobs. Meanwhile, datacenters in the state have a history of not delivering on job or tax revenue creation estimates.

Still, pro-business Democrats view the centers and economic development as a “magical unicorn that will solve everyone’s problems,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former state legislator and clean energy advocate. Many politicians refuse to consider the facilities’ externalized costs and problems, Rabhi added.

“There’s no discernment and anytime you start asking these questions, it’s met with a ‘How dare you question or push back on it,’” Rabhi said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f237fce10e82e5b07da60e603c5d42ca66ba5844/340_0_4501_3600/master/4501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b079cfd60d067a978b7e10137fef5167",N,,2026-01-13 11:02:17.092727

The DATA Act of 2026 was proposed by Senator Tom Cotton (Republican, Arkansas) and would amend the Federal Power Act.

“American dominance in AI and other crucial emerging industries should not come at the expense of Arkansans paying higher energy costs,” Cotton said in a statement. “My bill will ensure that America can continue to lead in these spaces by eliminating outdated regulations.”

If passed the bill would create a new utility category called “consumer-regulated electric utilities” (CREUs), with companies who build their own independent power infrastructure falling under this new designation. In order to qualify for CREU, the utilities would have to be completed disconnected from the main grid and built solely to serve new electric loads. Consequently, if the utility subsequently connects to the grid it would lose its exempt status.

The exemption would allow data center developers to avoid the provisions of the Federal Power Act, including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rate regulation, reliability standards, interconnection rules, transmission planning, and merger approval.

The act would also permit the companies to sell electricity at retail to other customers, subject to the caveat that the system is islanded from the grid.

According to Cotton, the bill would accelerate energy innovation, exempt new off-grid projects from outdated federal regulations not designed for on site, self-contained power systems, and enable data centers and other energy intensive sectors to construct electricity systems without impacting existing grids or ratepayers.

It seems likely that the bill will be vehemently opposed by electric utilities, as it would threaten their revenue streams.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is responsible for permitting and enforcing environmental regulations data centers are required to adhere to, including air emissions, wastewater discharge, hazardous material storage and water use.

But advocates say the agency is already stretched thin and emerging technologies like large-scale Al facilities could add to that strain.

“If we want our regulatory agencies like the TCEQ to be in a position to protect us from major environmental impacts of data centers, then we need policy,” said Kathryn Guerra, a former TCEQ employee who now works with Public Citizen. “The TCEQ doesn’t have near the resources it needs to enforce the permits that it’s issuing.”

More than 400 data centers have already been established in the Lone Star State, and Guerra said once a data center applies for federal air or water permits, communities have limited ability to stop the project from moving forward.

“We have a weak agency because state lawmakers want it that way,” she said. “We can’t expect the TCEQ to be a check on the growth of industry or the environmental harm that data centers are bringing to Texas.”

A 2024 study examining data center’s impacts of public health shows that centers like the ones in Ellis County are already creating hidden health risks from air pollution that industry reports often overlook.

According to the researchers, training a single large Al model produces as much pollution as driving across the country 10,000 times — meaning these facilities could eventually be as harmful to the air as heavy highway traffic.

Ahead of the 2025 Legislative Session, the TCEQ asked the state legislature for $60 million in additional funding in order to efficiently enforce its duties.

“Without additional resources, it will be difficult for TCEQ to meet the increasing demands placed on the agency, including emerging technologies, and maintain state primacy for many of its programs,” the agency wrote to the legislature. “If TCEQ does not have sufficient resources, permit timeframes will lag and TCEQ’s ability to timely respond to the needs of regulated entities and the public will be hindered.”

KERA News reached out to the TCEQ to see if agency leaders believe it can execute its investigative duties at its current funding level.

In its response, the agency said, “TCEQ follows all state and federal regulations including compliance when handling new technologies.”

Data centers that support artificial intelligence also require enormous amounts of electricity and water to operate. SMU professor Venky Shankar said the scale of demand is unprecedented.

“You need five or six nuclear power plants to get eight megawatts,” said Shankar. “We’re anticipating, if the state is friendly, if a lot of these things go according to plan, you might see as high as 200 megawatts by the end of 2030.”

Shankar said water use could also affect surrounding communities.

“You may need an average of two million gallons of water per one megawatt,” he said. “That has implications for the communities because there could be water shortages at peak times of summer.”

Most recently, citizens from the City of Granbury have become weary of the city’s decision to annex over 2,000 acres of unincorporated land from Hood County.

The city asserts they have no plan for the annexed land.

“I understand there’s been a lot of speculation, but what I can tell the council and the public is that there is absolutely no application for any development received by the city as to that property,” said City Attorney Jeremy SoRelle. “Whether that be 5,000 homes or some sort of commercial industry or, as I’ve heard, data centers, that will be looked at.”

But during a council meeting Tuesday night, dozens of residents voiced their opposition to the annexation, fearing the land could open the doors for data centers to move in.

“I’ve yet to meet anybody who wants to live next to a data center because of the reported air, light, noise pollution, as well as the water and energy consumption,” said Granbury resident Jacob Herbold. “My question is, ‘Do data centers fit with our identity as a town?’ I say no.”

Other residents questioned whether economic development should outweigh potential public health concerns.

“Y’all can pretend that you don’t know what it’s for and you may not, but I’m not sure I believe that,” said pediatrician Shannon Watts. “But I just need to point that out, that I don’t think there’s any reason that you should sacrifice the health of our community for any amount of money.”

Several residents say they fear development could change the character of the city.

“You’re pushing the city into our country living where we want to be left alone,” said Carolyn Reeves. “We’re concerned about noise, we’re concerned about air pollution, we are concerned about our water and our electricity.”

While the TCEQ can issue fines or require corrective action for permit violations, Guerra said enforcement is often slow, making it difficult to document problems like emissions or nuisance conditions.

“Often, the thing that they’re complaining about isn’t happening three or four or five days later when the investigator is finally able to go out,” she said.

In its 2025 enforcement report, the TCEQ reported that only 6% of claims made were investigated within five days. Most claims were investigated a month after a claim was made.

Guerra believes the TCEQ is nowhere near capable of enforcing the large influx of AI data centers.

“We really can’t depend on the TCEQ to be the entity that’s checking that growth and ensuring that it’s protective of the environment and of communities,” she said.

Trump’s first stop work order attempt was overturned in September 2025.

Revolution wind is already over 80 percent complete. Once finished, Revolution Wind has the potential to power 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The project has created 1,200 stable, well-paying jobs in the region.

Trump’s Department of the Interior had halted construction on all five offshore wind projects underway in the United States in December. The pauses impacted Revolution Wind, as well as Vineyard Wind 1, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind 1.

In response, Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne issued the following statement:

“Trump’s clean power cancel culture is senseless and, as repeatedly proven in court, illegal. The offshore wind industry is capable of providing good, local jobs and reliable energy without the volatility of gas and fossil fuel prices, meaning steady, affordable energy costs for Americans.”

Sierra Club Connecticut Chapter Director Samantha Dynowski added:

“Yet again, Connecticut workers can get back to work on this local project nearly ready to provide our communities and neighbors with clean, affordable energy. Completing Revolution Wind will lower pollution, improve the health for vulnerable groups, and, critically, lower energy bills. Connecticut residents need this project cross the finish line.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-13 09:58:40.127610

In 2025, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) supported communities recovering from Hurricane Helene, took actions to address PFAS contamination and continued to protect the state’s natural resources for the health and prosperity of all North Carolinians.

The monumental task of helping communities recover from Hurricane Helene, while rebuilding in a way that makes them more resilient to future storms, played a central role in the Department’s actions last year. In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 12 months on helping North Carolinians recover from the hurricane.

2025 By the Numbers

Aiding recovery, resiliency in WNC

In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 18 months on helping North Carolinians recover from Helene:

Awarded $365 million in grants for water infrastructure repairs and resiliency.

Mapped 4,000 landslides, helping North Carolinians stay safe from future slides.

Inspected 400 dams.

Awarded $12 million to clean up debris in streams and rivers.

Designated 177 debris collection sites.

In 2025, DEQ received the first federal funding through EPA to improve flood resiliency to drinking water, wastewater and septic systems affected by Hurricane Helene. The Division of Water Infrastructure received $685 million in supplemental funds and has completed two funding rounds using these funds to date.

The Dam Safety Program established the North Carolina Dam Safety Grant Fund in accordance with House Bill 1012 (SL2025-26), making $10 million in state funding available to dam owners for the rehabilitation and/or removal of Hurricane Helene damaged high-hazard dams.

In August, EPA awarded DEQ a $61 million grant for Hurricane Helene State Program Support for Hazardous Waste Management. The grant will run through Sept. 30, 2030, and will assist North Carolina with emergency response and recovery from Hurricane Helene. It also will fund preparations for emergency recovery as related to DEQ’s hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, recycling and materials management, emergency response programs and pesticide management.

DEQ created the Western NC Recovery Grants Program that provides free, customized grant writing support to local governments and partner nonprofits in Western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene. The program objective is to help impacted communities secure federal and state funding for long-term recovery projects.

NC Geological Survey staff mapped more than 2,600 landslides resulting from Hurricane Helene and responded to more than 400 landslides.

The NC General Assembly allocated emergency disaster recovery funding to DEQ’s Underground Storage Tank Section (UST) to assist owners and operators with testing and repairing tanks that store petroleum and hazardous substances and were damaged by Hurricane Helene. The program provides temporary financial assistance for emergency services until owners receive federal disaster relief funds or insurance reimbursements. Loans are interest-free and mature upon the earlier of receiving federal disaster relief or other funding, or by June 30, 2030. As of November, DEQ had received 11 loan agreements for more than $1.2 million.

DEQ received an EPA grant (with state matching funds) totaling more than $15.8 million to assess and cleanup spills of petroleum from USTs damage by Hurricane Helene. The grant will run through March 31, 2030, and can be extended an additional two years. The UST section has identified more than 15 sites that may be eligible for funding. Assessment or corrective action is underway at nine facilities. Evaluation of additional sites is ongoing.

The Division’s Solid Waste Section approved 177 sites for temporary management of debris from Hurricane Helene. The section also worked with regional officials and residents to manage the debris.

In the aftermath of Helene, the Asheville Regional Office assisted by the Winston Salem Regional Office conducted more than 400 dam safety inspections.

The State Energy Office (SEO) launched a $5 million Clean Energy Microgrid Initiative to deploy small solar-powered microgrid systems in areas that lost power due to Hurricane Helene. As of December, five microgrid sites had been selected and materials were being purchased.

DEQ received the first federal funding for onsite decentralized wastewater to support Hurricane Helene recovery. The $22.5 million EPA award is currently open for applications through the Division of Water Infrastructure until March 2, 2026, and funds the replacement and repair of septic systems in a 39-county region of WNC.

DEQ awarded a $10 million grant to MountainTrue, an Asheville based nonprofit, to clean up debris from 125 miles of streams. Funding from DEQ has allowed the organization to hire 79 workers, who removed an average 10,000 pounds of debris from Western NC waterways daily.

Investing in Communities and Building Resiliency

In 2025, the State Water Infrastructure Authority awarded more than $877 million in loans and grants to update and harden drinking water, wastewater and septic systems, limit chemical pollution (PFAS), replace lead pipes and assist towns damaged by Hurricane Helene while improving resiliency for future storms.

The NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint program awarded $25.2 million to projects in 16 counties to build more resilient communities and protect lives, property and livelihoods across North Carolina. The program, through partnerships with agencies such as the NC Land and Water Fund, NC Emergency Management and the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, funded more than 73 projects valued at more than $78 million in total. The total investment from the Blueprint program for these initiatives amounted to over $34.4 million, demonstrating a highly efficient use of state resources where program dollars are working twice as hard through leveraged funding.

In 2025, the Division of Mitigation Services (DMS), initiated 14 new mitigation projects that will permanently protect approximately 97 acres of wetlands along with nearly 20 miles of stream and 91 acres of riparian buffer. These projects represent an investment of approximately $59 million to restore and protect natural resources in North Carolina. DMS currently manages 206 active and ongoing mitigation projects.

In 2025, DMS received mitigation credit releases valuing more than $40 million. In addition, 29 projects were closed out resulting in:

16.2 miles of stream restored and protected

174.2 acres of wetland restored and protected

92.66 acres riparian buffer area restored and protected

20.92 acres of Nitrogen and Phosphorous nutrient offset

In 2025, DMS assisted 235 development projects by taking responsibility for 270 new mitigation requirements including:

58,206.6 stream credits

80.9 wetland credits

1,367,513.8 riparian (streambank) buffer credits (equivalent to 31.39 acres)

6,388.45 Nutrient Offset Nitrogen credits (equivalent to 2.8 acres)

3,514.7 Nutrient Offset Phosphorus credits (equivalent to 24 acres)

DMS and Ecosystem Planning and Restoration completed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for the existing and future conditions (after implementation of flood mitigation projects) of the Stoney Creek watershed. The Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program’s first pilot project, a stormwater wetland basin on the Wayne Community College campus in Goldsboro, was completed in December. Construction on a second natural infrastructure project in the Stoney Creek watershed should begin in early 2026.

The State Energy Office’s Weatherization Assistance Program completed work in 1,380 households, including repairing or replacing 543 heating units and weatherizing 838 homes.

SEO reached agreement with three weatherization agencies for a combined contract value of more than $33 million to begin delivery of weatherization services with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in four of the seven program regions.

The $208 million Energy Saver North Carolina program Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs launched Jan. 16, 2025, which includes the Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) rebates.

As of December, the program processed applications in 98 of the North Carolina’s 100 counties. Residents in Mecklenburg and Wake counties can apply beginning in January 2026.

2,600 North Carolinians completed an application.

Approximately $650,000 rebates paid.

An estimated 293,000 kilowatts annually saved.

Households participating in the program will realize an estimated annual average savings of $945.

SEO selected nine projects to receive $2.79 million in Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants. The projects will reduce energy usage and lower costs for local governments, state agencies and universities.

Seven subawardees were selected for nearly $20 million in funding to improve North Carolina’s electric grid: the City of Wilson, Duke Energy Carolinas, Fayetteville Public Works Commission, Four County Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), Surry Yadkin EMC, Tideland EMC and the City of Gastonia. The request for proposals for the next funding round of about $9.7 million will be released in 2026.

The Utility Savings Initiative saved $159 million in avoided utility costs in fiscal 2024–25 and a cumulative $2.26 billion in avoided costs since fiscal 2002–03 by using efficiency improvements across state facilities.

The Division of Air Quality (DAQ) awarded $1.91 million for new public electric vehicle chargers across North Carolina, filling gaps in the state’s charging network along highways and in rural communities. The projects will prevent more than 657 tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere and will avoid 125 pounds of nitrogen oxide emissions and 1,191 pounds of volatile organic compound emissions.

DAQ awarded $1.14 million in grants for clean vehicle projects, including more than $270,000 for new all-electric vehicles. These awards are projected to eliminate 3,483 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 57 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 7,700 pounds of fine particle emissions.

The Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) received $26 million in EPA funding in October for grants to local communities in western North Carolina to improve recycling operations damaged by Hurricane Helene and to conduct recycling and waste management workshops for disaster preparedness.

DEACS awarded $1.17 million (plus $1.11 million in matching funds) in recycling grant funding to 19 businesses and 15 local governments for projects that are expected to create 31 jobs and divert 25,000 tons of material from landfills annually.

DCM’s Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP) awarded $6 million to 32 communities across coastal North Carolina. A total of $1.9 million was allocated to cover technical assistance in risk assessment and resilience planning, as well as incorporating resiliency into Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) Land Use Plans. Grants totaling more than $4 million were awarded to communities to support engineering, design and construction.

DCM’s Public Beach and Coastal Waterfront Access Program awarded more than $2.25 million in grants to support 10 projects that will expand and improve public access to North Carolina’s beaches and coastal waterways. The next round of funding for this program will be announced in January 2026.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service awarded a $1 million coastal wetlands grant to DCM for the purchase of The South End at Topsail Beach. This is the final portion of the total $8 million that was required for the conservation of this ecologically rich barrier island property. The South End consists of more than 100 biodiverse acres of salt marsh, maritime forest, dune and beach on a dynamic ocean inlet. The NC Coastal Land Trust will execute the purchase and transfer the property to DCM, which will maintain it as a public access area in cooperation with the town of Topsail Beach.

DCM received $227,833 in funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program, which provides funding to marinas and other boating facilities for outdoor recreation. The funding will allow staff to training opportunities.

The Division of Water Resources awarded more than $2.6 million in grants to support stream restoration, water-based recreation and water management projects across North Carolina. The total includes nearly $2.3 million awarded through two different grant cycles of the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects fund, and $350,880 to support two stream restoration projects on agricultural lands through a cost-sharing program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

DWR awarded more than $9.39 million for five projects in coastal North Carolina for beach and dune renourishment. There were five projects that received funding from the Coastal Storm Damage Mitigation Fund, which is funded by the N.C. General Assembly through Session Law 2023-134 for costs associated with beach nourishment, artificial dunes and other projects to mitigate or remediate coastal storm damage to the ocean beaches and dune systems of the state.

DWR awarded more than $5.8 million in grants in funding from the Flood Resiliency Blueprint to support projects that provide flood reduction or flood resiliency benefits across the following six river basins across North Carolina: Cape Fear, French Broad, Lumber, Neuse, Tar Pamlico & White Oak basins. The grants were awarded to 10 local governments through a one-time appropriation of flood resiliency funding received through the NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint administered through the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects program.

The State Resilience Office (SRO) joined DEQ in July to support resilience-building statewide. The SRO, previously at the N.C. Department of Public Safety, supports local governments and their partners to plan for and invest in resilience initiatives. The SRO also manages the NC Resilience Exchange, an online toolbox of resilience resources and staffs the Interagency Resilience Team, a partnership of state agencies working to promote resilience efforts across state government.

SRO, in partnership with the State Climate Office, kicked off its second Planning for Extreme Heat Cohort Program. Nine local governments from the coast to the mountains participated in the program with the goal of developing a local heat action plan. Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related impact.

In January, SRO published the NC Resilient Communities Planning Guide to help local leaders, especially local governments, plan for a more resilient future in their communities. This two-volume tool guides users through the process of understanding their vulnerabilities and developing a project plan to address them.

The Blueprint Tool, posted in April, serves as a resource for communities, local governments and partners by providing accurate, data-driven flood-risk and vulnerability assessments.

The Blueprint released its first progress report in March.

The NCGS brought in record external funding this year with 11 grant projects totaling more than $2 million. The projects cover an array of topics from foundational geologic mapping needs to critical minerals and rare earth element studies to data preservation.

Protecting North Carolinians from Forever Chemicals

DEQ continues to lead on addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in North Carolina, guided by the Action Strategy for PFAS. DEQ continues to work on limiting PFAS discharges to the environment, protecting public health and addressing remediation efforts to clean up existing PFAS contamination. The Division of Waste Management (DWM) continues to direct Chemours Co. Fayetteville Works plant to sample private wells and provide alternate water as warranted based on results. DEQ has also required Chemours to expand sampling to an area that now encompasses 10 counties.

The Bernard Allen Memorial Emergency Drinking Water Fund, administered by DWM, continues to notify persons whose private wells are at risk of PFAS contamination, test private wells for PFAS and provide alternate drinking water to owners of wells contaminated by PFAS. The program sampled 414 private wells for PFAS and provided drinking water to 113 residences in the past fiscal year. Requests for sampling of private wells continue to increase.

DEQ required Chemours to expand welltesting (Opens in new window) in the lower Cape Fear region under its consent order, expanding eligibility to 14,000 additional residences.

The Environmental Management Commission adopted groundwater standards for three types of PFAS: PFOS, PFOA and GenX.

DWM’s Solid Water Section has required all permitted sanitary landfills to sample their facilities’ groundwater monitoring networks for PFAS and has directed facilities to update receptor surveys and sample private wells and provide alternate water when applicable. The majority of DWM programs are directing drycleaning facilities, pre-regulatory landfills, permitted hazardous waste facilities and inactive hazardous facilities to evaluate PFAS effects and where applicable direct these facilities to complete updated private-well receptor surveys and provide alternate water where applicable.

DEQ’s Division of Water Resources worked with Sampson County Disposal LLC to develop a special order of consent that requires SCD to begin testing groundwater and water runoff from the Sampson County Landfill for PFAS and to install an advanced groundwater treatment system. Sampson County Landfill is the first landfill with a proposed direct discharge that will install an advanced treatment system designed for PFAS removal.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section staff coordinated with DWI to hire a contractor to develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan that has been submitted to EPA for approval. The plan will allow Federal Emerging Contaminants Small and Disadvantaged Community Grant funds to be used by DWM and the PWS Section to collect hundreds of samples to test for PFAS in drinking water and provide technical assistance to affected communities.

DWR’s Groundwater Resources Branch completed its initial round of statewide groundwater PFAS sampling of a statewide network of groundwater monitoring wells. DWR has incorporated additional follow-up PFAS sampling into the branch's routine sampling process.

DWR, at the request of the Environmental Management Commission, developed proposed rules that would establish industrial users discharging wastewater at publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities (POTWs) and direct dischargers to perform for one year baseline monitoring for three PFAS compounds: PFOS, PFOA and GenX. Dischargers that have results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the PFAS compounds. POTWs will submit to DWR annual reports on the activities of significant industrial users. Industries will continue water sampling and following plans until the three PFAS compounds cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

At the request of the Environmental Management Commission, DWR developed proposed rules to minimize 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA has identified as a likely carcinogen. The rules would require large industrial users discharging wastewater for treatment at POTWs and direct dischargers that likely have 1,4-dioxane in their wastewater perform baseline monitoring for the compound for one year. Dischargers showing sampling results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate 1,4-dioxane. Industrial practices will be summarized, and POTWs will submit annual reports to DWR. Industries will continue water sampling until the compound cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

DEQ completed a study of PFAS concentrations in saltwater fish species in the lower Cape Fear region. The studyfound (Opens in new window) a consistent presence of the compounds across the seven species studied.

Additional accomplishments

DAQ released an update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a continued trend of declining air pollution emissions and improved air quality. In August, North Carolina celebrated being in compliance with every federal health-based air quality standard for 10 consecutive years, which benefits public health and the economy. Among the 20 most populous states in the U.S., North Carolina has the longest running streak of being in statewide attainment with the standards.

For the second time in its history, DAQ recorded no exceedances of the ozone air quality standard during the year.

DAQ upgraded the Air Quality Portal’s public mapping tool, the Ambient Information Reporter. Improvements include a new Air Quality Index layer, measuring fine particulate data and a better display of surface visibility data.

DWM’s Brownfields Redevelopment Section celebrated the 750th Brownfields Agreement at a site known as Brown School, which has been transformed into an affordable housing community called the Brown School Lofts at Legacy Heights.

DEQ’s environmental education program hosted 30 livestreamed talks with top researchers and educators in partnership with the NC Museum of Natural Sciences that reached more than 7,000 viewers this year. The talks are broadcast on YouTube and shared with schools, universities and colleges, state agencies and the public.

In 2025, 46 educators achieved the NC Environmental Education Certification, a nationally recognized professional credential managed by the DEQ in partnership with various state agencies. The program saw strong growth with 92 new enrollments, with both classroom teachers and nonformal educators pursuing their certification. To earn the certification, participants must commit to 200 hours of professional development, community leadership and instruction.

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program team submitted to EPA its Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which details 14 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and presents ways to reduce statewide emissions by 50% by 2030 from the 2005 baseline, and attain net-zero by 2050.

The Department submitted an updated NC Energy Security Plan to the Department of Energy that included new sections on critical infrastructure and cross-sector dependencies, emergency preparedness and response, energy sector threats and impacts, a risk assessment, and risk mitigation and coordination.

The NC Geological Survey digitized about 500 geophysical well logs and created an online viewing tool, allowing for easier and deeper analyses without specialized software.

The NC Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) Study and Evaluation Tool was completed in association with Applied Weather Associates in May. The PMP replaces outdated values provided in hydrometeorological reports. The study relies on the most current practices for defining PMP, including comprehensive storm analyses procedures, extensive use of geographical information systems, explicit quantification of topography and coastal effects, updated maximum dew point and sea surface temperature climatology for storm adjustments, and improved understanding of weather and climate related to extreme rainfall in the region.

Nearly 40 experts attended two workshops held by the Coastal Reserves program to develop habitat resilience plans for the Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island reserves. Attendees addressed habitat vulnerability and risk, research, monitoring and solutions. The Masonboro Island Reserve workshop yielded a list of 41 research and monitoring needs to foster future resilience at the site. Products from the Zeke's island Reserve workshop are under development.

DCM’s Local Permit Officer Program held a two-day workshop in May for 60-plus officers in central and southern sites and in October for Northern/Northeastern officers. The workshops included field trips to Manteo and Swansboro and included presentations by Division staff and other state and federal agencies representatives, rule updates, hands-on training in the field and dialogue/discussions with questions and answer sessions.

DCM celebrated the 40th anniversary of the state’s National Estuarine Research Reserve, designated by the state and NOAA to protect special places in the state, including the Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island Reserves. This designation inspired the state to later create the umbrella N.C. Coastal Reserve, which is authorized by the N.C. Coastal Area Management Act.

Across all reserve sites, the total value of DEQ’s volunteer program was $38,374.13. (1,340.75 reported volunteer hours valued at $33.01/hour.) 500-plus pounds of marine debris removed by volunteers.

DMF, in cooperation with the NC Department of Information Technology and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, put into effect Dec. 1 new harvest reporting requirements for recreational and commercial fishermen.

DMF’s Observer Program launched in February the automated Observer Trip Scheduling System, which schedules observer trips for Estuarine Gill Net Permit holders. The Division worked with the N.C. Department of Information Technology and volunteer commercial fishermen to develop the system, which is a requirement of North Carolina’s Endangered Species Act Section 10 Incidental Take Permit.

DMF completed and implemented four fishery management plans — for Spotted Seatrout, Eastern Oyster, Hard Clam and Southern Flounder — that were adopted by the N.C. Marine Fisheries Commission.

The Artificial Reef Program finalized its five-year timeline for ocean reef enhancements, funded by Coastal Recreational Fishing License revenue. The Artificial Reef Program plans to complete one project per year, for a total of five projects, one in each coastal region.

The Utility Scale Solar Decommissioning Program rules went live Aug. 1 and allows project owners to create an online account to register utility-scale solar projects, upload decommissioning plans and financial assurance mechanism documents, pay registration fees and update project.

DWR protects water quality in North Carolina by processing permits, certifications and conducting inspections for facilities that discharge wastewater. DWR staff responded to resident complaints and investigated wetland and streambank vegetation to ensure compliance with state law. Regional staff:

Inspected 707 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted facilities, 100 sanitary sewer collection systems, 583 non-discharge wastewater treatment facilities and 1,872 animal feeding operations.

Responded to 1,609 individual incidents and complaints.

Completed 1,025 stream determinations and 967 wetland/buffer inspections and investigations.

Performed, with support from the Public Water Supply Section, approximately 5,400 site visits, including 1,835 sanitary surveys.

DWR’s 401 water quality certification program, which assesses and regulates water quality construction damage to streams, streambanks and wetlands, issued 2,534 certifications. The program’s average processing time for the certifications was 29 days, less than half the program’s goal of 60 days.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section Plan Review Unit reviewed 93% of 1,553 drinking water infrastructure engineering projects as of Dec. 12 for compliance with public water system state rules.

DWR launched a tool to display the results of freshwater sampling conducted through the WNC Recreational Water Quality Monitoring program to help the public identify locations where E. coli levels are above or below recreational guidance values in three river basins.

Between Nov. 24, 2024, and Oct. 25, 2025, DWR’s Water Sciences Section laboratories reported 150,769 compound results.

As of Nov. 20, DWR’s Algae Lab resolved 332 reports received on the Fish Kill & Algal Bloom Dashboard, an interactive tracking tool.

Data Center Map located 4,304 such facilities across the country, and Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers' power demand will increase 165% by 2030.
As a result, ""rising electricity prices are squeezing American households,"" Rewiring America reported, citing lagging wages and expired federal clean energy incentives as factors.
""There's been some recent polling showing that data centers are not very popular,"" Wyent told Fast Company.
""Our perspective is that data centers are going to be built.","Home solar is a proven safeguard against surging electricity rates. If the technology were widely installed, the added electricity per household would add up significantly, according to Rewiring America.

The experts' most notable recommendation is that tech companies should foot some of the bill for panels, battery backups, and energy-saving heat pumps for homes well-suited for the tech because they would free up power for their own computing.

""We saw this trend happening with data centers needing capacity on the grid and thought by upgrading households, we can actually create a significant amount of capacity,"" Rewiring America's research and data science head Cora Wyent told Fast Company.

At issue is the increasing number of computing hubs being built to process artificial intelligence, chatbots, and all the other computing we do daily. Data Center Map located 4,304 such facilities across the country, and Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers' power demand will increase 165% by 2030.

As a result, ""rising electricity prices are squeezing American households,"" Rewiring America reported, citing lagging wages and expired federal clean energy incentives as factors. To compensate, some of the tech giants have invested in solar farms to provide sustainable energy at scale.

Elsewhere, electricity suppliers are turning to coal and natural gas for the juice, but those fuels create byproduct air pollution that is a burden to community health at every stage of life, according to the American Lung Association.

The Cool Down's Solar Explorer makes finding the best home solar setup simple. It will connect you with innovative solar subscription plans such as Palmetto's LightReach for no money down and zero installation or maintenance costs. Customers pay a set monthly fee and use all of the electricity, slashing utility rates by up to 20%.

EnergySage is another trusted partner of the Solar Explorer. Its experts can help you find incentives, secure vetted quotes, and receive installer recommendations when buying panels. EnergySage has reported that panels cost $30,000 on average to install outright, making leasing appealing to homeowners on a budget.

Rewiring America suggested that the tech companies pay 30% of the upfront cost, though. If done at scale, the outlet says the price of the arrays would drop by 40%, making the overall project at parity with building a gas plant, and much more affordable for customers.

What's more, helping homes update aging HVACs with efficient heat pumps would help to free up even more grid power, Rewiring America added. Pairing the panels with efficient appliances adds to the savings, and TCD's HVAC Explorer will get you started on a heat pump upgrade that can save you up to 50% on your heating and cooling costs.

Additionally, Palmetto's free Home app makes it easy to unlock up to $5,000 in rewards that you can use for improvements at your house — all with some simple, everyday actions.

Rewiring America wrote that the scaled per-household work could be completed faster than building dedicated power plants — in months instead of years — and win over much-needed homeowner sympathy.

""There's been some recent polling showing that data centers are not very popular,"" Wyent told Fast Company. ""Our perspective is that data centers are going to be built. So why don't we try to make that as beneficial as possible to the communities where they will be built?""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aZbWLmsmeRoNG_fx.Fa6SQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/257cdb81e67e13bb58e866f30ea4105c,N,,2026-01-13 13:01:15.076459

Mary explained that the moment the prospect of tariffs arose in late 2024, the executive team sought ""no-regret moves"".
Pragmatism amid regulatory disruption While trade barriers have been a significant concern, Mary said that shifting regulations caused even more disruption in 2025.
Mary said: ""We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030.","At a fireside chat hosted by the Automotive Press Association at General Motors’ new Hudson’s Detroit headquarters, the hot topic was how the company will navigate a cooling EV market and a volatile trade environment.

Mary Barra, CEO of GM, addressed the dual pressures of multi-billion-dollar tariff projections and the dismantling of federal EV incentives.

Despite these headwinds, the leadership remains resolute.

""Our destination is to get to the all-EV future we've been talking about,"" Mary said, though she conceded that the roadmap has become significantly more complex.

The company is now balancing its ""North Star"" EV ambitions with a ""self-help"" reorganising programme designed to shield its bottom line from geopolitical shifts.

Mitigation through domestic production shifts

GM previously projected that the Trump Administration’s tariffs on imported vehicles and parts would cost it an additional US$5bn in 2025.

However, Mary said aggressive internal restructuring enabled it to offset approximately 30% of that impact.

Mary explained that the moment the prospect of tariffs arose in late 2024, the executive team sought ""no-regret moves"".

This resulted in a US$4bn investment in US manufacturing during the summer of 2025. It included bringing the production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox back from Mexico to the US.

Pragmatism amid regulatory disruption

While trade barriers have been a significant concern, Mary said that shifting regulations caused even more disruption in 2025.

The expiration of the US$7,500 US tax credit in September triggered a 43% year-on-year decline in EV sales during the fourth quarter.

Mary said: ""We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030. Now, without the consumer tax credit… we are on a different path.”

This has forced a more ""pragmatic"" stance. While she maintained that ""once someone buys an EV, they're 80% more likely to buy another EV”, she acknowledged the necessity of a transition period.

Consequently, the company will introduce hybrids where necessary to bridge the gap until charging infrastructure becomes sufficiently robust.

Reappraising the electric vehicle business

The transition has not been without significant financial pain.

On 8 January, GM revealed in a regulatory filing that it expects to record US$7.1bn in special charges for the fourth quarter.

This includes a US$6bn write-down related to a reappraisal of its EV business and production plan changes.

Despite these figures, Mary defended the original strategy, saying: ""As I go back and look, everything that we knew at that point in time we would have made the same decision.”

Restructuring operations and software goals

The financial charges also cover a US$1.1bn restructuring of the company’s operations in China, a market that has proven increasingly difficult for legacy automakers.

As GM adjusts its global footprint, it is shifting its focus toward high-margin software and driver-assistance technologies.

Mary highlighted the company’s roadmap to achieve ""eyes-free"" advanced driver-assist technology by 2028 as a key competitive advantage.

""We have to think, 'What will the regulatory environment be beyond 2028?'"" she said, adding, ""We will announce what vehicles we're refreshing when the time is right. I think we’re just getting started.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/75196b101060a4e32940a740821e43f3:44ea5a63e97c1018464c16f786ed9db5/mary-barra.webp.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 09:59:35.247163

Yet it’s crucial to improve sightlines into sourcing regions as extreme weather events surge.
With advanced remote sensing capabilities, satellites offer a continuous, bird’s-eye view of sourcing regions and the risks from extreme weather.","The impact of climate and weather volatility is increasingly tangible for businesses worldwide. Extreme weather is resulting in failed and reduced harvests, completely disrupting and reconfiguring the supply chain. This year alone we’ve seen wildfire devastation and record breaking hurricanes in the U.S., while droughts and floods further afield continue to affect businesses and consumers, with unsustainable food price increases. This creates a perfect storm of business disruption across procurement, production, and profitability.

In 2026, the ability to interpret how accelerating weather and climate volatility influences production will become a decisive competitive edge. Organizations will no longer be able to rely solely on historical patterns or reactive risk management. Instead, they will need continuous, forward-looking visibility into both real-time conditions and future disruptions that could impact operations and supply continuity.

The reality of first-mile risk

The “first mile,” e.g., sourcing regions where soft commodities are grown and harvested, is particularly susceptible to risk. In fact, as much as 60% of business costs and risks occur within the physical places where these commodities originate.

At the same time, we’re seeing growing regulatory pressure for those exporting to the EU as a result of the EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation). Despite changes to the regulation, and delays to its implementation, the EUDR should be front of mind for any organization that imports goods like cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy, and wood into the European Union. Organizations that don’t meet the core deforestation objectives – by ensuring deforestation has been eradicated in their supply chain since 2020 – could face fines and in some cases a temporary ban from the EU market.

Shifting from assumption to evidence

There are therefore many moving parts to getting the first mile right, and extreme weather adds yet another complication. Until recently, a lack of transparency and access to information on the first mile has meant managing all of these risks is particularly challenging.

Yet it’s crucial to improve sightlines into sourcing regions as extreme weather events surge. Farm Bureau data highlights the massive scale of destruction related to extreme weather-related disasters, with 27 across the U.S in 2024 alone, each with damages exceeding $1 billion.

Despite widespread flooding and hurricanes, drought and heat-related conditions drove the majority of U.S. crop losses, totaling more than $11 billion. Texas experienced the greatest agricultural losses for the third year in a row, with damages exceeding $3.4 billion. Cotton was the most affected crop at $1.8 billion in losses, followed by forage and rangeland, as well as wheat. In fact, more than two-thirds of Texas’ losses in 2024 were caused by drought, excessive heat, and hot winds.

To insure harvesting land against these events, risk has traditionally been evaluated through assumption-based models; for example, a percentage chance of whether the event is likely to occur. Yet the technology available today is changing this method for the better. With the climate crisis worsening, assumption-based modelling is simply no longer a sustainable nor necessary approach. Instead, risk can be evaluated with evidence. With deep scientific, environmental and weather analysis, it’s possible to track when land is getting drier, vegetation is becoming denser, and atmospheric conditions are changing - signaling a wildfire, for example. This progress means that not only can risk be reduced significantly, but preventative measures can be put in place to stop the worst from happening.

Closing the visibility gap

In order to enable this advanced risk analysis, the technological shift centers around satellite and drone imagery. The reality today is that historical and more traditional methods of land records and fragmented datasets are outdated. Until now, the original approach to understanding risk and managing the first mile has created a significant visibility gap, generating supply-chain wide uncertainty and growing business cost.

What’s more, much of the first mile data already out there is either insufficient or incorrectly classified. There have been cases where palm oil tree plantations have been misclassified as forests, for example, which in turn would create incorrect flags for EUDR’s deforestation requirements once it is enforced. It’s therefore crucial that businesses utilize technology to generate and validate datasets themselves. The good news is that satellite output now offers 10-meter resolution imagery, enabling businesses to monitor land use change, forest degradation, or methane emissions across vast areas with granularity.

Going one step further, agentic AI can implement expert workflows that can abstract complexity at a massive scale. For example, synthesising vast and heterogeneous datasets, from satellite imagery to transactional records, into actionable, defensible insights at the scale and speed that modern supply chains operate.

Cacao is one crucial example of how harvests have changed over recent years. Its huge price spikes have been driven by fundamental shifts in production conditions across West Africa. This is because cacao is particularly susceptible to climate related viruses like swollen shoot disease caused by heavy rainfall, which can decimate crop harvests. In fact, in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, where over 50% of the world’s cocoa originates, prolonged rainfall, disease, soil degradation and rising temperatures have undermined yields – forcing manufacturers to make choices between cost, quality and composition.

Yet with satellite imagery and AI, businesses can gain greater insight into their sourcing regions and understand where may be most susceptible to flooding based on recent weather events. With advanced remote sensing capabilities, satellites offer a continuous, bird’s-eye view of sourcing regions and the risks from extreme weather. Then, acting as a connective tissue between data sources, AI can apply deep scientific expertise to analyze and predict harvest success in the future. With this intelligence, businesses will understand where their biggest risks exist. Further still, they can take either preventative measures to improve harvests, or source new harvesting regions to mitigate another unsuccessful year.

The power in prediction and prevention

It’s undeniable that preventing disruption is more cost-effective than managing a crisis. For businesses in 2026, it’s crucial they prioritize supply chain resilience. A successful supply chain is one that can integrate predictive models and environmental risk insights into their planning cycles in order to reduce exposure, limit losses, ensure operational efficiency and act faster.

The reality is that companies that are able to detect risk and monitor the success of harvests throughout the year, then allowing preventative action, will be the ones that succeed as extreme weather events continue to expand risk posture in the coming decade. Climate-resilient operations should be a key consideration at board level, and technology will be critical in making this shift a possibility.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260112-154932-af7-Simon%20Constance%2C%20Head%20of%20Partnerships%2C%20Treefera.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 11:03:07.923067

It would not apply to investor-owned utilities like Xcel Energy and Black Hills Corp.
“It’s not like there’s no commitment to getting us to clean energy.
Union, business and utility leaders held a “Colorado Energy Crossroads” summit last month in which they vowed to oppose efforts to speed the clean energy transition any further because it could hurt home budgets and jobs.
The bill announced Monday is the first legislative effort to seeks to push back against the speed of the transition.","Just days in advance of a legislative session where debates over energy costs are expected to take center stage, a bipartisan group of southern Colorado legislators on Monday announced they will introduce a bill to delay emissions-reduction mandates for some public utilities.

The group of two Democrats and two Republicans said they are supporting the effort specifically on behalf of Colorado Springs Utilities, which will not be able to hit its goal of 80% emissions cuts by 2030. Without this bill, officials said, ratepayers could face costly increases if the state forces CSU to reduce emissions in ways that are not feasible.

However, the proposal would apply to all municipally and otherwise publicly owned utilities, allowing them to file new Clean Energy Plans this year with extended deadlines if they are having problems identifying replacement options for more affordable fossil fuels. It would not apply to investor-owned utilities like Xcel Energy and Black Hills Corp.

Origin of the proposal

CSU has been working to find alternative fuel supplies to shutter the Ray Nixon Power Plant by 2029, as is now required, but has found contracts for renewable power purchases 30% to 50% more expensive than anticipated, CSU CEO Travas Deal said at a news conference. Unless it can keep the coal-fired power plant open a few more years to build transmission and generation infrastructure, CSU will have to raise rates to the point that it could make the region uncompetitive for businesses that are looking to expand and relocate, putting its residents and its economy at a disadvantage, he said.

In addition, the utility needs the time to build out infrastructure to ensure that the delivery of energy is reliable and does not lead to energy failures for residents and business, officials said. Even a momentary outage can cost a manufacturing facility or other business hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost productivity, which can end up hurting workers and costing jobs, said Johnna Reeder Kleymeyer, president/CEO of the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Corp.

“Some will ask me … ‘What are you doing on this bill?’ I’m going on this bill because it can strike the balance between reliability, affordability and clean energy in Colorado Springs,” said Rep. Amy Paschal, a Colorado Springs Democrat who described herself as an EV-driving, rooftop-solar-brandishing environmentalist. “It’s not like there’s no commitment to getting us to clean energy. But we will have to do that in a way we can afford the rates.”

Debate rising about green mandates

While the cost of the energy transition long has been a concern with fiscal conservatives, conversation around the subject seemed to pick up after the Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved a statewide Clean Heat Plan in December. That plan will require 41% reductions in emissions from building heating over the next 10 years and 100% reductions by 2050, necessitating a ban on natural-gas heating by that time.

The push by state agencies to reduce emissions comes as the northern Front Range remains in severe violation of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ozone regulations aimed at limiting the respiratory and other public-health effects of air pollution. State officials have mandated emissions-reduction plans for utilities, oil-and-gas producers, manufacturing facilities, commercial buildings and other sectors, but still the state is not on track to hit the standards.

But the Clean Heat Plan seemed to breed a new level of frustration about the mandates. Union, business and utility leaders held a “Colorado Energy Crossroads” summit last month in which they vowed to oppose efforts to speed the clean energy transition any further because it could hurt home budgets and jobs. A Black Hills official there said that the Clean Heat Plan could raise electricity bills for customers $215 per month.

The bill announced Monday is the first legislative effort to seeks to push back against the speed of the transition. Because municipal utilities are not regulated by the PUC, that body wouldn’t have any ability to get in the way of efforts to delay emissions-reductions mandates by a couple of years.

Why Dems and GOP support utilities on this

After a decade in which increased environmental regulations have largely become a partisan issue, it’s notable that this bill has bipartisan sponsorship. Democratic Sen. Marc Snyder of Manitou Springs will be a prime sponsor along with Paschal, as well as two Republicans — Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson of Alamosa and House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell of Monument.

Asked if the bill has any chance at passage, Snyder, the longest-serving legislator of the quartet, said he believes it has “a good shot” because it seeks only temporary extensions of fossil-fuel-burning sources necessary to make clean energy feasible in the long run. Caldwell said he and Paschal have talked with House Speaker Julie McCluskie and Majority Leader Monica Duran and that while they haven’t gotten commitments that the bill could pass, the leaders have been “receptive to it.”

It’s likely that environmental groups that have pushed hard for air-cleaning mandates since Gov. Jared Polis’ inauguration in 2019 will fight the effort as well, as many have noted Colorado already is not on target to reach its 2030 emissions-reduction goals. Backers fielded several questions at Monday’s online press conference asking why, if other utilities are on track to meet their 2030 goals, that CSU would need a special extension.

Utilities’ struggles a bigger business issue

Kleymeyer said that CSU, in endeavoring to meet its 2030 goals, had run into transmission constraints, market conditions resulting in higher renewable-energy prices and the limitations of speeding replacement of equipment at this scale. It needs more time to bring on replacement power and the flexibility to find other clean-energy options, not a limitless exemption from meeting its obligations, she said.

This proposal could run into not only opposition but bills seeking to do just the opposite of what it’s asking. Some state and environmental leaders have pushed for Colorado to accelerate the timeframe for utilities to reach net-zero emissions from 2050 to 2040, though the enthusiasm for such an effort appears to have dimmed somewhat.

Despite Snyder’s optimism, passage of the bill will not come easily, if at all. But the tone offered by sponsors on Monday seemed to establish the parameters they hope to set for the debate around environmental goals and energy costs this session — that the state can reach its goals, but it may need to adjust timeframes slightly to address the ongoing affordability crisis simultaneously.

“What we are seeing now is a growing gap between intention and reality,” Caldwell said. “Affordability matters. Reliability matters. And ignoring either one puts real people at risk.”",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ray-Nixon-Power-Plant-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 09:58:43.805772

Instead of forcing a single narrative around electrification or performance, the automaker is putting customer choice front and center. Gas, hybrid, electric, performance, off-road, family utility—it’s all here, and it’s all intentional.

From the return of legendary HEMI® V8 power to fully electric “Trail Rated” SUVs and reimagined family vehicles, Stellantis is clearly signaling that the future doesn’t have to be one-size-fits-all. For enthusiasts, truck buyers, families, and commuters alike, the company’s Detroit presence feels less like a corporate roadmap and more like a response to real-world demand.

Here’s how each brand is shaping that message.

Jeep®: Heritage, Hybrids, and Hardcore Capability

The Jeep® brand is celebrating its 85th anniversary by doubling down on what made it iconic in the first place—freedom, capability, and adventure—while continuing to move forward technologically.

Front and center is the all-new 2026 Jeep Cherokee, a midsize SUV that blends efficiency with real-world usability. Powered by a new turbo-hybrid setup, it delivers impressive fuel economy while maintaining the everyday versatility Cherokee buyers expect. This isn’t about chasing trends—it’s about balance.

On the other end of the spectrum sits the Jeep Recon, the brand’s first fully electric, Trail Rated SUV. With serious horsepower, instant torque, and legitimate off-road credentials, the Recon proves that EVs don’t have to be soft or soulless. It’s a Jeep first—and an EV second.

Add in refreshed Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer models, Wrangler special-edition “buzz” vehicles from the Twelve 4 Twelve program, and the return of Camp Jeep®, and the message is clear: Jeep isn’t abandoning its roots—it’s expanding them.

Ram: Muscle, Diesel, Electric—and NASCAR

If there’s one brand that best represents Stellantis’ shift toward a customer-driven strategy, it’s Ram.

The headline move is the return of the 5.7-liter HEMI® V8 to the Ram 1500 lineup. This isn’t nostalgia—it’s demand. Buyers wanted it back, and Ram delivered, pairing it with modern eTorque technology for better drivability and efficiency.

Then there’s the public debut of the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX, once again wearing the crown as the most powerful gas-powered production pickup. Loud, unapologetic, and over-the-top, it’s exactly what the TRX name should be.

Ram is also pushing boundaries in the heavy-duty space with the 2027 Ram 2500 Power Wagon, now available with Cummins diesel power for the first time. That’s a big deal for off-road truck buyers who want torque, durability, and factory-backed capability without compromise.

Electrification hasn’t been forgotten either. The Ram 1500 REV shows how range-extended EVs can work for truck owners, while Ram’s return to the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series reinforces the brand’s performance-first mindset.

Dodge: Multi-Energy Muscle Done Right

Dodge continues to prove that muscle cars don’t have to disappear—they just have to evolve.

The new Dodge Charger lineup is the perfect example. Buyers can choose between turbocharged internal combustion power or all-electric performance without losing the Charger identity. The Charger SIXPACK R/T delivers strong, affordable performance, while the SIXPACK Scat Pack brings serious acceleration and all-wheel-drive capability to the mix.

Then there’s the four-door Dodge Charger Daytona, which combines brutal performance with everyday practicality. It’s fast, spacious, and unmistakably a Charger—just reimagined for a new era.

Dodge also keeps its HELLCAT legacy alive with the Durango SRT HELLCAT Jailbreak, now available nationwide. It’s proof that Dodge understands its audience: some buyers want the future, others want supercharged HEMI power—and both deserve a seat at the table.

FIAT: Style Meets Sustainability

FIAT brings Italian flair to Detroit with the Fiat 500e Giorgio Armani Collector’s Edition, blending high fashion with electric mobility. This isn’t about performance numbers—it’s about personality, design, and urban livability.

Alfa Romeo: Performance with Precision

Alfa Romeo rounds out Stellantis’ Detroit showing with the refreshed 2026 Tonale, a compact SUV that prioritizes handling, steering feel, and driver engagement.

With turbocharged power, standard all-wheel drive, and a design that stands out in a crowded segment, Tonale shows that performance doesn’t have to mean excess—it can mean precision.

A Smarter Direction for Stellantis

In Detroit, Stellantis isn’t chasing headlines—it’s answering customers. By investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing, bringing back beloved powertrains, expanding electrification where it makes sense, and keeping brand identities intact, the company is charting a more realistic and sustainable path forward.

This isn’t a pivot—it’s a reset. And for buyers, enthusiasts, and the industry as a whole, it’s a welcome one.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC01099-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 14:00:58.390263

For years, the federal solar tax credit helped homeowners lower the cost of installing rooftop solar. That incentive has now expired, and many families are asking whether solar still makes sense. Without the residential tax credit, buying a solar system does cost more upfront.

But homeowners in communities like Sarasota, Bradenton and across Southwest Florida also understand something many others do not: When the power goes out after a major storm, it can stay out for days – and sometimes longer.

After hurricanes Ian, Helene and Milton, thousands of families were left without electricity while oppressive heat, humidity and serious fuel shortages made recovery even harder. For many, access to power became a safety issue, not just a convenience.

Imagine coming home to a house that survived the storm, but that had black mold growing everywhere. For many, that was a reality.

That is where rooftop solar paired with battery storage makes a difference. A solar and battery system can keep essential power running when the grid fails. Refrigerators, medical equipment, lights, phones, internet and even larger devices like air conditioning can stay on with a properly installed system.

Unlike gas generators, batteries do not require fuel, do not create fumes and do not need to be started or serviced in potentially dangerous post-storm conditions. For seniors, families with children and anyone who works from home, that kind of reliability is invaluable.

Rooftop solar is also hurricane hardened: Since reputable installers are required to follow the latest building code, they have to install rooftop solar to be stronger than storm forces. As many residents with solar panels confirmed after the recent storms, their rooftop solar systems were “just fine, thank you” through three major storms. Regionally, the vast majority of rooftop solar arrays in the area had no problems at all.

At the same time, Southwest Florida homeowners are facing rising electricity bills. Utility profits are higher than ever, but that’s not stopping utilities from increasing rates at an alarming pace. Solar helps families take back some control by reducing exposure to future rate hikes.

Even without the residential tax credit, homeowners still have options. Solar leasing agreements remain available, allowing families to go solar with little or no upfront cost.

As with any construction project, make sure to do your homework and hire a reputable, state licensed contractor. Members of our state industry association, FlaSEIA, which has a directory on its website, are some of the best.

Rooftop solar also supports Southwest Florida’s economy: Thousands of Floridians work in the solar industry. Local installers, electricians and contractors play a critical role in both clean energy and post-storm recovery. Local contractors have a vested interest in their customers’ success – so they are usually much more responsive if you do have an issue.

For homeowners considering solar today, the most important questions go beyond dollars and cents. They are:

• How long can my household function without power?

• Do I rely on electricity for medical devices or remote work?

• What is my plan for the next hurricane?

The solar tax credit is gone, but rooftop solar – especially with battery storage – remains a practical investment in resilience, stability and peace of mind.

Across the state, Wisconsinites are seeing their electricity bills rise, adding to existing economic anxiety over how to meet basic needs. This year, rate increases were approved for three major utilities, raising average bills as much as $13 per month.

At the heart of many energy cost discussions are data centers, which are being approved for development across the state. While there are many factors that can cause bills to go up, we already know that data center costs are being passed on to consumers in many parts of the United States. Furthermore, data center developers are manufacturing an false urgency to meet their steep electricity demands, but current policies and regulations in Wisconsin don’t protect ratepayers from cost increases or the potential adverse environmental, health and reliability impacts. Advocates on the ground are fighting for transparency and protections for their communities , but decision-makers need to both listen and take action by implementing comprehensive policy to protect their customers.

How utilities are responding to data center growth

Developers are seeking rushed approval of data center projects, and utilities in turn are seeking approval for billions of dollars of infrastructure to power them. Wisconsin doesn’t require Integrated Resource Planning (IRP), meaning each proposal to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) is a one-off request for a new project. This requires significant vetting time for PSCW staff and advocates to comb through all the paperwork, and makes it challenging to review proposals in a holistic framework. work.

Residents of Wisconsin may already be familiar with many of these projects…but more likely not, since proposals and approval processes have been mostly hidden from the public by use of confidentiality agreements between tech companies and decision-makers.

Notably, are the projects in We Energies’ territory. Microsoft’s data center plans include a suite of projects in Racine (yes, the one in Mount Pleasant that was supposed to be host to the now defunct Foxconn project years ago) and Kenosha counties with an initial plan of around 450 Megawatts (MW) with continued growth in the future. There’s also the data center planned in Port Washington hosted by Vantage (to be utilized by OpenAI and Oracle), estimated to need anywhere from 1 to 3.5 Gigawatts (GW) of electric generating capacity. According to Clean Wisconsin, 3.9 GW is enough to power 4.3 million homes in Wisconsin (currently, there are only 2.8 million housing units in the whole state).

To power these behemoths, We Energies is seeking approval for nearly 3 GW of generation capacity, including 1.4 GW of fossil gas. Last year, the PSCW approved We Energies application for $1.5 billion of gas plants to accommodate data centers’ energy demand. Around $1.4 billion dollars in transmission infrastructure is also being proposed in Port Washington to connect the data centers’ to the grid.

Another large utility, Alliant, is planning on being home to Meta’s billion-dollar data center in Beaver Dam; however, the company has not been forthcoming on the details of the data center’s planned energy demand.

This is not a comprehensive list and it’s worrying for various reasons. Instead of using less gas and coal, utilities are building more, pushing back coal plant retirements, setting the stage for increased pollution and health impacts and delaying a transition to clean energy. Tech companies have been notorious in keeping information from the public about their true plans, proposing duplicative and speculative projects, therefore creating a risk that utilities may overbuild generation capacity that ratepayers get stuck paying for.

A look at how regulatory cases raise energy bills

When it comes to the “large customer” terms and conditions—or “large load tariffs” in regulatory terms—the PSCW is also responsible for approving, modifying, or rejecting utility proposals brought forth by utilities. We Energies, for example, has proposed a Very Large Customer tariff which would require customers with huge electricity loads (aka data centers) to pay for their electricity needs differently than what residential and other commercial users are subject to. There’s no question that this is an important and necessary step in addressing potential unfair costs to ratepayers. Every utility should implement a fair cost rate for data centers, but the devil is in the details here, so we need to scrutinize the utilities too.

While the utility insists their proposal requires data centers to pay their fair share of energy costs, there are serious reasons to doubt these claims. We Energies’ proposal falls short of actually holding data centers responsible for their impacts, and if approved, ratepayers are at risk of seeing higher electricity bills. Let’s examine some of these issues.

The 500 MW qualifier: First, there’s the size threshold requirement. We Energies believes this special rate should only apply to customers requiring at least 500 MW of electricity. For reference, below is a snapshot from Halycon’s Large Load Tariff tracker, which accounts for the various applications being submitted and processed across the country for large users like data centers. That lone point in the top right corner with the big red arrow? That’s We Energies’ plan–the qualifying energy threshold is waaay bigger than what’s being proposed in other jurisdictions. This 500 MW threshold would exclude many data centers and other large users that should still be responsible for paying for their own energy needs.

Figure 1: Data plot of proposed sizing requirements for large load tariffs

We Energies does not explain why their criteria is so large beyond stating that the proposed structure wouldn’t be suitable for smaller customers. Source: Halycon

75% is not 100%: Under We Energies’ proposal, data centers may choose a specific capacity-only service from the utility which would only make them responsible for 75% of costs out of the portion of resource they want to use. Despite entire gas plants being built for the purpose of accommodating a data center, other ratepayers would still be on the hook for a significant portion of these ownership costs…plus 100% of the associated fuel costs. The utility claims their proposal creates a fair plan to make data centers responsible for their electricity needs, but their own application proves otherwise.

Transmission costs are not accounted for: The utility claims that data centers would also be responsible for paying the costs of transmission and distribution investments made to serve their electricity load, but then admits that there are hidden costs that they wouldn’t be able to trace back to the data center customer. My colleague, Mike Jacobs, broke this issue down in his recent analysis, showing that utilities in seven states in PJM (the regional transmission organization in the mid-Atlantic) passed more than $4.3 billion in local transmission upgrade costs on to other customers in 2024, and at least another $3 billion last year. Because of how costs are socialized in the MISO approval process, the true costs of transmission investments cannot be comprehensively traced back to the individual customer in order to assign responsibility. The result? Ratepayers are on the hook once again. Don’t be fooled – utilities have a lot of control over how much of those transmission costs are allocated (take a look at recent testimony analyzing the utility’s proposals for doing this). We Energies can’t continue to pass the buck on its responsibility to ratepayers.

Mismatched lifetime of assets: We Energies is proposing that data centers enter into a 15-year contract for which they’d be responsible for covering costs of energy assets like power plants. That may seem like a long period of time, except for the fact that newly approved gas plants serving just this kind of purpose are expected to operate for no “less than 30 years”. If a data center abandons their plans earlier than promised and that gas plant still has years of operational life left, ratepayers are possibly stuck with polluting stranded assets. The cost of stranded assets is already estimated to be around $1 billion dollars for Wisconsin energy customers.

The details of We Energies’ application matter because they are trying to claim that everything is fine, so there’s no need to scrutinize the details! They’d prefer regulators and the public to think that they’ve come up with the perfect solution, but their track record and the fine print tells us otherwise.

When we don’t scrutinize the validity of these applications by applying scientific and economic realities to profit-motivated claims, we lose the opportunity to fight for fair outcomes. We cannot and should not cede this ground. Communities become exposed to higher costs and environmental harms and the cycle continues. When left unchecked, decisions are made based on what’s negotiated between utilities and big tech companies, rather than what’s best for Wisconsin ratepayers. Hopes for future climate goals also become harder to achieve when new gas is built and coal plants don’t retire.

We don’t have to accept the backroom deals and attempts at distraction. Wisconsin can achieve clean and healthy energy systems that provide communities with affordable power.

What does data center accountability look like?

UCS has been studying the impact of data centers’ electricity demand in Wisconsin, and our forthcoming analysis will take a deeper dive into how different policy pathways may affect our energy future. The bottom line is that comprehensive policy must be enacted to ensure a healthier, less costly, and reliable future for communities. Below is a sneak peek at some of the recommendations from our analysis:

Data centers should bring their own clean energy: Data centers must not be a barrier to achieving clean energy goals in Wisconsin. With proper legislation to plan long-term, like an IRP, regulators and the public can hold utilities accountable for meeting the state’s energy needs and prioritizing clean, reliable energy infrastructure for the public rather than a few large customers.

To ensure the state’s long-term roadmap provides a path to clean and healthy energy, lawmakers must also commit to clean electricity legislation and guardrails for large users like data centers to bring their own new clean energy (BYONCE). Utilities must invest and offer comprehensive demand response and energy efficiency programs to help lower costs and conserve energy where possible.

Wisconsin state legislators recently introduced a bill, known as the Data Center Accountability Bill, to address some concerns about data center development. The bill aims to apply more stringent reporting requirements about data centers’ water and energy use, directs the PSCW to define a classification for large customers like data centers, creates renewable energy requirements for data centers, and provides guidance on how laborers constructing data centers should be fairly compensated. Rather than counting on data centers or investor-owned utilities to do the right thing, decision-makers must bake these principles into law.

Data centers must pay their fair share: Ratepayers in Wisconsin should not be on the hook for the costs that data centers incur. New policy is needed to require data centers to pay their fair share, while also helping to fund community energy efficiency programs and low-income communities, to ensure that the economic growth promised by developers actually flows to Wisconsin families. Utilities need to properly classify data center customers and make them responsible for 100% of their energy and infrastructure costs.

In addition to the Data Center Accountability bill, consumer advocates and energy experts from around the state are fighting to protect ratepayers from even higher electricity prices. By scrutinizing We Energies’ inadequate proposal that we discussed earlier, advocates are making it clear to regulators that corporate interests of power-hungry data centers cannot come before the needs of Wisconsin residents. Take a look at the details of case here.

Information Transparency: We can’t achieve any of the above goals if the public isn’t equipped with information. Data centers must disclose data regarding their intended energy, water, and other resource uses which would impact the communities surrounding them and the state as a whole. The public needs ample time to participate in the decision-making process; large corporations can’t be allowed to rush through approvals. A single user like a data center having the power to disrupt the livelihoods of so many with their energy use is unprecedented. State regulators must adapt accordingly by setting the expectation that thorough review from experts and the affected communities is a requirement when approvals by data centers are sought.

Wisconsin communities continue to show up in numbers to make their voices heard. Towns impacted by proposed data centers are sending a clear message to their elected officials that a lack of transparency over data center impacts will not be tolerated. Questions on the environmental impact of data centers and how they will impact the health and future of communities are still going unanswered, but the call for accountability is only growing stronger.

If there’s a single takeaway from this discussion, it’s that the future of Wisconsin’s energy and environment shouldn’t be decided by a select wealthy tech companies. Let’s not leave it up to data centers and utilities to decide whether or not to do the right thing. A just energy future means fair costs, clean air, and an informed public.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blog-Thumbnail-Microsoft-Logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:01:59.956623

The pressure on Big Tech to self-fund its energy needs comes as the Trump administration leans into the AI race with the Stargate Project, which is a massive $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced by Trump early in 2025 to build AI infrastructure. As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.

A ban on ranked choice voting also advanced.

Indiana already governs professional lobbyists paid to influence the legislative and executive branches, but Sen. Scott Alexander sees a gap.

“It’s really the influencers that we’ve been seeing that are influencing politics outside of the parameters of, for instance, the lobbyists,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Monday, after his Senate Bill 267 squeaked through the Senate’s Elections Committee.

Alexander, R-Muncie, wants transparency for those “paid to influence (or) paid to protest.”

His legislation focuses on “influence campaigns,” defined as attempts to mobilize the public to take some action or contact state officials — including via protest.

Executive branch leaders like the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, comptroller, treasurer and attorney general count, and so would the legislative branch’s lawmakers. Also accounted for are candidates, employees, consultants and close relatives of both branches.

Someone who encourages another person to engage in an influence campaign — and pays that person at least $500 in a year — would be required to file with the Indiana Lobby Registration Commission within 24 hours of handing over the cash, beginning July 1.

They’d need to submit detailed information on themselves, their organization, others involved in the influence campaign, their goals and their expenditures, according to the proposal.

“We would like to support Senate Bill 267, because there is certainly a need for more transparency around money spent to influence the legislative process,” said Julia Vaughn, with elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana.

However, she said, the group is opposed “because we think it’s duplicative of current law for registered lobbyists, at least, and unworkable for those it would apply to.”

Vaughn observed, for example, that the giver of money would be responsible for disclosing how it was spent, although that duty is typically placed on the recipient.

Administrative, 1A concerns

Regulator testimony revealed deeper dilemmas.

The Lobby Registration Commission is one of just two legislative branch agencies, alongside the Legislative Services Agency, said Edward Ferguson, the entity’s executive director and general counsel.

“We question the wisdom of putting the ILRC in a position of having to deal with actions taken to influence executive branch members, especially since the executive branch has its own statute concerning lobbying,” Ferguson said, noting he’d been in touch with ILRC’s commissioners about the bill.

Lobbyists who earn at least $500 annually to influence the legislative branch file with the commission. Those who make at least $1,000 annually to influence the executive branch register with the Indiana Department of Administration.

“The ILRC has never in its history regulated lobbying and influencing in the executive branch,” Ferguson told the committee. “I see a separation of powers issue here.”

Furthermore, the 24-hour deadline for reports “seems unreasonable and a bit confusing,” he added, because payments for lobbying services are often made weeks or months after.

He anticipated the ILRC would be “swamped” with reporting problems.

The agency has just one full-time employee — Ferguson — and a part-time employee, supplemented by an additional staffer during peak registration and activity reporting periods, he said.

“Our current staffing level is ultimately insufficient” to handle Senate Bill 267, Ferguson continued, in contrast to an LSA fiscal impact analysis that said increases in workload “are within the routine administrative function” of the agency and could be absorbed with “existing resource and funding levels.”

First Amendment advocates, meanwhile, warned the legislation could infringe upon constitutionally protected paid advocacy.

Samantha Bresnahan, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said while the group supports transparency in government, “it must be balanced against constitutional rights.” The bill could “chill” political association and participation, she said.

“If what the bill’s authors hope to accomplish is to squelch paid protesters … this bill is not a way to accomplish that,” agreed Barbara Tully, with the League of Women Voters of Indiana.

Paid protester perceptions

Outrage over allegedly compensated paid advocacy is growing nationwide, although fact-checkers like Politifact have repeatedly found such accusations aren’t supported by evidence.

“I know that some of my colleagues thought there were some paid protesters during the redistricting fight,” said Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis. Several demonstrations, both for and against President Donald Trump’s map-drawing push, were held before the campaign failed.

“Do you believe that … there are people that are being paid to protest?” Ford asked Alexander.

“Around the Statehouse? I would say there probably are,” he responded. “Yeah, yeah, for sure.”

Asked if his bill was aimed at paid protesters, Alexander told the Capital Chronicle, “No, not necessarily.” He acknowledged it could “catch” compensated advocates.

But, he emphasized, there’s “definitely not an intent to push down on free speech.”

Another colleague questioned whether social media influencers who are paid by political parties or outside groups would also have to report activity.

Lawmakers of both parties expressed misgivings following testimony, prompting Alexander to admit, “This is a bill that we got down to the wire on.”

Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, asked if the bill could be held, but committee chair Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, noted the panel meets on Mondays and next Monday is a holiday. The deadline for bills to pass from committee is Jan. 26.

Legislative leaders plan to adjourn in late February, two weeks sooner than usual, to offset the cost of the two weeks they dedicated to redistricting in December — compressing the 10-week session into just eight.

“What I would like to ask the committee is that we go ahead and move the bill, if you think you can move it today with the promise from Sen. Alexander that he will work with us on a substantial revision on second reading,” Gaskill said. “I think that’s the only possibility at this time to give the bill the hope of moving forward.”

Several witnesses and committee members offered their assistance.

“I do think that it has potential,” said Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport. “But, again, I offer the help to get it in a good spot, because right now it’s not.”

The legislation advanced on a 6-3 vote. Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, joined two Democrats in opposition.

Ranked choice preemption moves

A prohibition on ranked choice voting was also voted out of committee.

Most elections use a single choice model. In a ranked choice version, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority of ballots on which they are listed as the top choice, the other rankings are used to determine a winner.

“Part of the problem with ranked choice voting,” said Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, is voters who only wish to support one candidate either complete the ballot to “vot(e) against that person at some point” — or skip the rankings and don’t get counted in later rounds.

“That scares us,” Doriot said, noting that Indiana Code is silent on the issue, and could be impacted by the results of a federal lawsuit, for example.

Opponents of his Senate Bill 12 indicated the ranked choice approach could help bridge the partisan divide.

Tully said the league in Indiana supports ranked choice voting to “reduce the toxicity of negative campaigning, to advance those candidates who have broad support, to keep candidates and campaigns issues-focused.”

Advocates of the ban, including the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, said ranked choice voting is complicated to administer and creates longer ballots for weary voters to fill out.

Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project said Indiana should outlaw the system even though it’s not currently used, adding, “You should not wait for the ranked choice voting lobby to make Indiana a target.”

Brad King, the Republican co-director of the bipartisan Indiana Election Division, said the state’s home rule law already bars local units of government from using election procedures like ranked choice voting, but that it doesn’t prevent all litigation.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1125995-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 08:00:35.698172

Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years.
But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.
In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.
Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady - or even come down - other costs such as rent, dining out and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity - the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way - is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand - particularly from data centers - is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” - the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the U.S. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity - not tear it down - will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

The Senate was expected to make progress on permitting this month after the House passed the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R.","Senate Democrats hope the White House’s quest to win the artificial intelligence race with China will blunt President Donald Trump’s unrelenting hatred of offshore wind turbines and help restart talks on a permitting deal. It may be wishful thinking.

The administration’s decision in December to halt the construction of five offshore wind projects prompted Democrats to pause bipartisan permitting negotiations on Capitol Hill at a time when some of the nation’s most powerful lobby groups are increasing pressure on Congress to ease project approvals. They said continued attacks on wind and solar means the president can’t be trusted to treat all projects fairly.

Now, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, is calling on technology companies involved in artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers to intercede with the president.

“The artificial intelligence folks, the crypto folks, the data system folks who need massive amounts of electrons — you all need to start showing up and letting people know that you actually want permitting reform, and you actually want an administrative and regulatory process in which electrons are treated fairly, irrespective of source, so you can get the power that you need,” Whitehouse said during floor remarks Wednesday.

Whitehouse and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the Energy and Natural Resources ranking member, have been working with Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Whitehouse on Wednesday took pains to say congressional Republicans weren’t the problem in the permitting talks. That title, he said, belonged to the White House.

Trump on Friday reiterated his hatred for wind during a meeting with oil company leaders, saying, “My goal is to not allow any windmill to be built — they are losers.”

Asked whether he thought an intervention from Big Tech would matter, Whitehouse said, “It could make a big difference if the AI, crypto and data people said, ‘Wait a minute, we need these damn electrons.’ They have not. They are just beginning to. We are seeing them for the first time in the permitting reform conversation.”

Some tech lobbyists, however, argued they have been engaged for some time. “This isn’t like a new policy priority for us,” said Cy McNeill, senior director of federal affairs at the Data Center Coalition.

“It’s a pretty simple equation,” he said. “The time it takes to build a data center and the time it takes to build new energy infrastructure is just mismatched in this country, so our priority lies in trying to minimize that delta as much as possible.”

McNeill, during an interview with POLITICO’s E&E News, worked to keep the conversation away from politics, noting they are not in the habit of getting into “fights about which energy generation resources are more valuable.”

“This isn’t something we’re doing in direct response to Democrats calling for us to be more vocal on this,” he said. “This is something that has been a long-standing priority for us, and when we talk to Democrats and Republicans, we talk about the need for more electrons on the grid and shortening that timeline.”

He declined to elaborate on their specific outreach to administration officials, and was hesitant to talk about what their long-term strategy might look like. “I will say: This is our No. 1 policy priority,” he said about permitting.

This is a “real issue” for us, he added, not a “buzzword we’re using to weigh in on the conversation.” For example, the electric utility Dominion Energy saw delays connecting to transmission infrastructure, he said.

Rich Powell, executive director of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, said he was cautiously optimistic both sides could still come together to agree on permitting language to, essentially, ensure that once construction is underway, “a deal is a deal.”

But he stressed that time is of the essence. The bipartisan Energy Act of 2020, which passed that December, was on the Senate floor by March. “It gives you a sense of how mature things will have to be,” he said.

Powell acknowledged frustrations on both sides of the aisle about the Trump administration pausing nearly complete projects, but said: “Our sense is that there is a deal here.”

Powell said his conversations with the administration have revealed three priorities: preserving energy affordability, preserving reliability of the grid and winning the AI race.

“They have taken all kinds of actions, maxed out their ability to go after three things,” he said.

Trump took to Truth Social on Monday to say the administration was working with tech companies to make sure they pay for their energy use.

The Senate was expected to make progress on permitting this month after the House passed the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, to ease the National Environmental Policy Act review process.

But the bill passed the House only after GOP leaders struck a deal with ardent offshore wind opponents who wanted to ensure the Trump administration could continue to block projects it dislikes — at least for now.

Last week, “SPEED Act” sponsor House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) waved off questions about the White House continuing to attack renewable energy.

“If you ask some people in my party last Congress, they would say they didn’t trust the previous administration, which again amplifies why we need permitting reform,” he said. “It’s why Congress needs to act.”

He also touched on a key argument that could compel the White House to play ball: “The Trump administration is doing a remarkable job approving projects and getting things going, but under the current process, a new administration could come in and cancel those projects.”

Nick Loris, executive vice president for policy at C3 Solutions, a consulting firm, suggested the argument about offshore wind was something of a red herring because even without government interference, the industry has supply chain and cost challenges.

“That battle can be lost on the merits of economics and yet it’s the political wedge that’s further driving the divide for permitting reform,” he said.

“I don’t think anything President Trump says on renewable energy is going to change but my hope is that if there’s some movement forward on renewable energy broadly — even if it’s done quietly — is that’s enough to narrow the divide on renewables and get us enough votes.”

Heinrich was not exactly sure the data center push would work: “In theory, if decisions were being made from a logical point of view, then yeah, because there’s a giant new load demand, right, but I don’t know that this administration has been making logical decisions.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1e/f6/298bcdb74b28bfe5d563ae1f306c/sheldon-floor.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 07:59:56.329585

Ormat Technologies (Ormat) has announced the signing of a 13-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Switch, the premiere provider of AI, cloud, and enterprise data centers.

Under the PPA, Switch will purchase approximately 13 MW of power from Ormat’s Salt Wells geothermal power plant located near Fallow, Nevada, with an option to further expand the output to Switch by adding an approximately 7 MW Solar PV facility. This will help power Switch’s Nevada data centers.

“We are excited to partner with Switch, a leader in the data center industry, to supply reliable, zero-emission power from our Salt Wells geothermal facility. This agreement not only advances Switch’s sustainability goals but also underscores the growing demand for renewable energy within the data center sector,” said Doron Blachar, CEO of Ormat.

Energy delivery under the PPA is scheduled to commence by the first quarter of 2030. This will be after the completion of a major upgrade to the Salt Wells power plant, which is expected to be finalized by the second quarter of 2026. The Salt Wells geothermal power plant is one of the assets that Ormat acquired from Enel Green Power North America back in 2023, as ThinkGeoEnergy reported.

“We are proud to enhance our diverse portfolio of renewable, Nevada-based energy sources and deepen our commitment to powering Switch’s data centers with renewable energy through this new long-term agreement with Ormat,” said Alise Porto, SVP of Energy & Sustainability at Switch.

A recent white paper examines Southeast Asia’s swift industrial growth amid this rising demand and the region's energy transition.

Participants in the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2026 will discuss how to support sustainable economic growth while strengthening competitiveness.

Southeast Asia is entering a decisive decade. With more than 670 million people and a $3.8 trillion economy, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) rapid growth is driving energy demand that is projected to more than double by 2050. How ASEAN meets this surge in demand will shape the region’s economic and industrial resilience, job creation and environmental future for decades to come.

Without decisive action, rising energy demand risks deepening fossil fuel dependence at a moment when ASEAN needs more diversified, affordable and resilient energy pathways to sustain industrial competitiveness and economic growth. Meeting this challenge will require solutions that can deliver impact at scale, and fast.

How industrial clusters can power the energy transition

Southeast Asia is becoming one of the world’s most powerful drivers of energy demand as it grows into a major global production hub. ASEAN countries host a range of energy-intensive industrial clusters – from electrical and electronics manufacturing in Malaysia, Singapore and Viet Nam, to automotive, chemicals and advanced manufacturing in Thailand, and resource-based industries and an emerging electric vehicle battery value chain in Indonesia.

Companies within the same industrial area often share similar needs, such as reliable energy, modern infrastructure, new technologies and access to funding. Well-organized industrial clusters create an ecosystem for collaboration to meet these needs. Co-located companies can share resources, coordinate plans and pursue energy transition opportunities that would be difficult to achieve alone.

A recently published white paper, Industrial Transformation in ASEAN: A Cluster-Driven Model for Regional and Global Collaboration, from the World Economic Forum and the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution shows how these hubs are turning national energy transition ambitions into on-the-ground delivery of low-carbon industrial transformation. The report explores how industrial clusters in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand use partnerships, policy, technology and finance to power growth and competitiveness.

1. Developing partnerships and a common vision

No single company can decarbonize an entire value chain or build low-carbon infrastructure alone. But when businesses collaborate across sectors and borders, they can share risks, aggregate demand and accelerate the adoption of new technologies.

In Indonesia, the Indo-Pacific Net-Zero Battery Materials Consortium (INBC) is bringing together companies across mining, processing and battery manufacturing to create an integrated, low-carbon battery hub on the island of Sulawesi. With plans to scale production dramatically by 2030, INBC’s common vision, shared infrastructure and coordinated planning could help to strengthen ASEAN’s position in the global clean-tech supply chain.

2. Providing clear and long-term policy direction

When governments set consistent regulations, clear roadmaps and predictable incentives, they reduce uncertainty and make it easier for private finance to commit to low-carbon projects. Effective policy frameworks can help to align public and private priorities, guide infrastructure decisions and create the confidence investors need to scale clean energy solutions across industrial clusters.

In Sarawak, Malaysia, for example, the Bintulu Industrial Cluster has benefitted from the state's Post COVID-19 Development Strategy 2030 and the Sarawak Energy Transition Policy. Bintulu is also advancing hydrogen production, carbon capture and renewable energy projects, supported by measures such as a forthcoming state-level carbon levy under the Sarawak Carbon Roadmap. Consistent policy signals are helping to attract investment, positioning Bintulu as one of Malaysia’s emerging low-carbon industrial hubs.

3) Scaling innovative, low-carbon technologies

From renewable energy systems and digital optimization tools to clean fuels and advanced automation, new technologies can dramatically reduce emissions while boosting competitiveness.

When deployed at the cluster level, companies can share infrastructure and operate at scale. This helps technological innovation to create efficiencies that would be impossible for individual entities to achieve alone. Industrial clusters can also unlock the benefits of technology convergence – the integration of digital systems, clean-energy solutions and advanced industrial processes.

Singapore’s Tuas Port is using technology to become a future-ready, low-carbon hub designed to support the future use of clean fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia. The fully electrified and highly automated port uses digital systems and smart energy management to cut emissions and improve efficiency.

4) Unlocking finance for industrial transformation

Decarbonizing heavy industry requires significant capital because many emerging technologies still face high upfront costs. Blended finance, public-private partnerships and de-risking mechanisms can help attract the private investment needed to scale low-carbon solutions. When financial innovation is directed toward industrial clusters, it can turn ambitious transition strategies into bankable, investable projects.

In Thailand, the Saraburi Sandbox is located in a province that produces nearly 80% of the country’s cement. It’s using blended finance from international partners to support projects in low-carbon cement, alternative fuels, biomass and solar, alongside community initiatives. This targeted financial support, backed by clear national climate goals, is helping to boost the area’s industrial decarbonization plans.

Supporting ASEAN’s industrial clusters

Accelerating Southeast Asia’s energy transition will require tighter alignment across policy, industry and finance, as well as industrial transformation. Governments can set the pace by harmonizing standards, providing clear long-term regulations and gradually rebalancing fossil fuel subsidies. Stronger carbon pricing and disclosure frameworks will also help to build investor confidence.

At the same time, industrial clusters offer ideal environments to pilot clean technologies, share infrastructure and coordinate investments, supported by transparent governance and long-term offtake agreements. Mobilizing finance at scale is also essential. Blended-finance tools, de-risking mechanisms and green lending can turn promising ideas into bankable projects and help to decarbonize heavy industry.

ASEAN energy demand may double by 2050, but emissions do not have to. With aligned policies, collaborative industrial cluster ecosystems and innovative financing, the region can turn ambition into action and emerge as a global model for sustainable industrialization.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_0pT58ryaIaYZvoDrl0lV8WoZG9NBPwje8-KjCtBnIHQ.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:13:00.624148

At the same time, the Trump administration and the GOP Congress are systematically blocking the cheapest forms of electricity to meet this new demand.
There’s no secret why—they’ve said over and over again that it’s in service to the oil industry.
The battle against the LA Dogers sponsorship by the oil industry is going national, as the World Series champions look forward to next year’s schedule.
The fossil fuel industry is essentially running the United States government from the inside.","This may have been the worst week in recent American political history—from the oil-soaked invasion of Venezuela and the threats against half a dozen other nations, to the debut of Elon Musk’s new child pornography tool, to the murder of Rene Good, whose last kind words were ‘I’m not mad at you.’ I hope and trust you’ve been out in the street—our small Vermont town had a half-mile of mourners carrying candles.

The midterm elections are not yet looming over us, but they’re very much in mind—along with street protest, we also badly need to beat MAGA for control of Congress, which would give the forces of relative reason at least a small foothold in our political life. Those midterm contests should turn on revulsion at fascism, but chances are they will be decided, at least in part, on what we’re now calling ‘affordability.’ And energy may well be at the heart of that: what eggs were to 2024, electricity may be to 2026. So it’s going to be crucial for candidates to be able to talk effectively about this topic. I imagine I’ll be revisiting this many times this year, so consider this a first primer—and consider forwarding it to you local good-hearted candidate. (And should you decide to become a candidate yourself, Run for Something is a great resource, and remember that Lead Locally has an upcoming virtual training session for potential climate-focused candidates).

I think the most basic message is: keep it simple. Energy and utility policy is intricate and abstruse, a matter of PUCs (public utility commissions) and ISOs (independent system operators) and RTOs (regional transmission organizations). We need to repair incentives for utilities, so that they’re spurred to save energy instead of build infrastructure; we need to move to a “connect and manage” system that forces fast interconnections. But you don’t actually need to explain all of that every time you give a speech. Instead, you need to establish a few things.

The Trump administration and the GOP Congress are dramatically increasing demand for electricity, mostly because they’re approving every data center any of their billionaire buddies suggest. You might point out that the biggest fruits to date of all this electricity are a lot of weird child porn on X, and a hard job market for entry-level workers seeing their prospects crimped by AI. And you could point out the absurd pollution it’s producing—black neighborhoods of Memphis, for instance, get to breathe the smog from Musk’s jet engines powering Grok. But the basic bottom line is: a sudden, Republican-led spike in demand for power.

At the same time, the Trump administration and the GOP Congress are systematically blocking the cheapest forms of electricity to meet this new demand. They’ve shut down wind farms that were sending power back to shore and they’ve prevented big solar farms from being built. There’s no secret why—they’ve said over and over again that it’s in service to the oil industry. For America as a whole this is a treasonous gift to the Chinese, who are now assuming world leadership in energy technology. But in each Congressional district what it means is: no cheap energy for us, thank you Republicans

When you increase demand and decrease supply, prices go up. Electricity prices increased something like ten percent last year. This is the Republican tax—the gratuity that you get to add to your electric bill to help the oil barons who in turn pass on a small amount in campaign donations to the GOP. (If you really want to piss people off, point out that the rates paid by data centers have gone up far far less than the rates paid by, um, people)

And that rise in rates compounds over time, because we just keep paying. If you want your voters to understand what they’re missing, you need to point to Australia. a country of 40 million people who—beginning in June, right at the start of the general election season—will be getting three free hours of electricity every afternoon. There is not a voter in America who can’t understand three free hours of electricity a day—time to run your washing machine, cool your house with the AC, fill your storage battery. “Friends, if we had leadership like Australia’s, we’d be getting free power. Instead, you get to give the fossil fuel industry a big gift. When I’m elected that will end.”

I’m not claiming that this is everything you need to know about energy to govern effectively. But what I know is that Republicans have won too many elections in recent years reciting simple lies: crime is out of control, immigrants will take your job, climate change is a scam. It’s time to win elections by telling simple truths—clean energy is cheap and abundant, and comes with lots of jobs attached.

Oh, and no one is going to need to invade Venezuela to grab their share of sunlight. I think people are growing tired of the violence that surrounds every aspect of Trumpism, including the conquest of foreign countries. So say that too.

I think it’s a winning message.

+Hannah Ritchie and Pablo Rosado with some data on how much land we need for solar power—if we took just the acreage the world currently uses to grow “biofuels” like ethanol and covered them with solar panels, we could produce twenty three times more energy, which would be enough to power every car and truck on the planet four times over.

The reason these comparisons are even more stark than biofuels versus solar is that most of the energy consumed in a petrol car is wasted; either as heat (if you put your hand over the bonnet, you will often notice that it’s extremely warm after driving) or from friction when braking. An electric car is much more efficient without a combustion engine, and thanks to regenerative braking (which uses braking energy to recharge the battery). That means that driving one mile in an electric car uses just one-third of the energy of driving one mile in a combustion engine car.

Put these two efficiencies together, and we find that you could drive 70 times as many miles in a solar-powered electric car as you could in one running on biofuels from the same amount of land.

+So the EPA is going to stop calculating how much damage pollution does to people, and instead only add up how much regulations cost polluters. Maxine Joselow, in the Times, calls the shift “seismic.”

“The idea that E.P.A. would not consider the public health benefits of its regulations is anathema to the very mission of E.P.A.,” said Richard Revesz, the faculty director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law.

“If you’re only considering the costs to industry and you’re ignoring the benefits, then you can’t justify any regulations that protect public health, which is the very reason that E.P.A. was set up,” said Mr. Revesz, who led the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

+Following up on my last newsletter about Greenland, Andy Revkin helpfully interviews a bunch of scientists who have worked there over the years, and who—not surprisingly—think taking it over is a crummy idea for a long list of reasons. As the veteran polar scientist Eric Rignot observes

A takeover by the USA could put an end to many international scientific studies in Greenland, which would be dramatic. We need to leave Greenland to the greenlanders. We need to respect them and work with them. We need to find a way to cooperate with them on the terms of their choosing. They have all the reasons in the world to be scared by the USA. The USA has not taken care of its own indigenous people, the condition of American indians is absolutely terrible. Until we show the world that we can take care of our own people, we should not pretend that we can take care of greenlanders.

Greenlanders will protect the environment in Greenland, they care about it deeply, they have done so for many generations. No other nation will do that job better than them. This is their home. Leaving Greenland to greenlanders is the best way to protect Greenland and the best way to show greenlanders the respect that they so much deserve

+Good news from New York where the first interview with the city’s brand new comptroller indicates that he’s serious about taking on the financial industry’s biggest players for their egregious climate stance. Mark Levine succeeds Brad Lander in the post, and he told Responsible Investor he will hold “every asset manager to extremely high standards on climate.” The point in question: should the city take its huge pension funds out of Blackrock, which has been a climate backslider for years (the result of red state treasurers applying the kind of pressure Levine is now considering).

+Interesting new paper from the International Journal of Astrobiology arguing that perhaps one reason we don’t find many other signs of intelligent life in the universe is that planets might need to develop coal in order to industrialize, and that coal is relatively difficult to create in massive quantities. Except, sadly, on our planet.

Central to our argument is the host of highly contingent taphonomic factors, involving plate tectonics and climate, that were required to convert the tropical lycopsid swamp forests of the Pangean supercontinent to the massive coal deposits of the Carboniferous period.

+A cogent argument from Chris Hatch, who points out that oil prices barely moved during Trump’s attack on Venezuela, probably because more and more players are realizing that we’re not going to need as much oil as we used to think.

The big reason is electric vehicles. More than half the new vehicles sold in China were EVs last year, and by the end of the year, the figure had risen to almost 60 per cent. “The rapid adoption of electric vehicles in China has been a major driver of China’s shrinking oil footprint,” according to the European Centre for Economic Policy Research.

It’s a shift that’s not limited only to cars, but extends from buses to two and three-wheelers and heavy trucks. And it’s a trend that’s unmistakable across Asia and the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, Tina Casey writes at Clean Technica that oil execs are skittish because they know that another big round of improvements in solar cells seems likely as perskovite cells get closer and closer to commercialization. She quotes Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm

“Utility scale perovskites are here!” Granholm posted on LinkedIn last week.

“I had the pleasure of visiting Tandem PV this week and their solar panels are at 29% efficiency today and will be over 30% within weeks — which means they are 30% more efficient than the average solar panel,” Granholm elaborated.

“That means less land necessary for solar installations, and lots of LCOE savings,” she added, with LCOE being shorthand for levelized cost of energy, a calculation that enables costs to be compared across different energy resources.

If you caught that thing about “less land,” that’s just as significant as the 30% efficiency improvement. Less land translates into lower costs for site acquisition, preparation, and maintenance, and it also provides farmers with more opportunities for agrivoltaic projects, in which solar panels are combined with farming in integrated systems.

+In the morbid contest for which climate side-effects killed the most people last year, heatwaves appear to have outdone fires and floods. According to World Weather Attribution,

Among all extremes, heatwaves stood out as the most lethal. In Europe alone, one study estimated that 24,400 people died during a single summer heatwave between June and August, across 854 cities representing nearly 30 per cent of the continent’s population.

In many parts of the Global South, however, comparable mortality data does not exist, the report noted, masking the full scale of heat-related deaths.

Continued greenhouse gas emissions meant that what might otherwise have been a relatively cooler year instead became an extremely warm one, fuelling prolonged heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods across the world.

+Forget the petrodollar. Aaron Foyer predicts the rapid rise of the electroyuan

Being a technology supplier gives China enormous leverage, especially with countries that are developing and looking to energize on a budget. Projects that are financed by Chinese banks, built by Chinese companies or assembled using Chinese parts could receive favorable financial terms in exchange for using renminbi in the agreements.

A perfect example of this occurred in 2023, when a Chinese developer built a 500-megawatt solar farm in Uzbekistan and stipulated the power contracts be settled in yuan. But Uzbekistan is just one of many countries striking these sorts of deals with Beijing.

The rise of an electroyuan would completely reshape global financial architecture and geopolitics.

For one, it would increase the yuan’s share in international payments, something that’s already been growing for over a decade and brings a certain inertia with it. Countries that become economically tethered to Chinese power projects might start invoicing in yuan by default. Over time, swaths of Asia, the Middle East and Africa could start conducting their commerce and trade in yuan, further eroding the trade dominance the dollar has enjoyed for decades.

An international yuan trading world would also hand Beijing incredible geopolitical leverage and weaken U.S. influence. Just as the widespread use of the dollar gave the U.S. the ability to hit bad-boy nations with financial sanctions to compel their governments into taking specific actions, China could pull the same Don Corleone moves.

Along somewhat the same lines, Bloomberg’s Mark Gongloff argues that the smart money around the world is pouring into green tech, despite Trump’s best efforts

Global green-debt issuance hit a record $947 billion last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, as the obvious need for cheap, quickly built energy supply in the AI age mostly outweighed the bluster from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Issuance could hit $1.6 trillion next year, one analyst told Bloomberg News. The AI bubble might need to keep inflating for that prediction to come true. But even if the mad scramble to build data centers happens to cool, continuing demand for electrification and cheap power in developing markets should put a solid floor under cleantech for the foreseeable future.

Globally, solar and wind-power growth in the first nine months of 2025 was more than enough to meet the increase in the world’s power demand during the same period, the think tank Ember noted recently. As renewable-energy market share grows, it economically outperforms fossil fuels, driving demand for still more renewable power. “The direction of travel is unmistakable: Clean power is scaling, markets are shifting and the electricity system is becoming the center of economic strategy — from AI growth to energy security,” Ember analysts wrote.

+A new study of a small Antarctic glacier found that its retreat was the fastest ever measured, which may be an ominous sign for much larger chunks of ice. Laura Paddison reports:

Hektoria is a relatively small glacier by Antarctic standards, and its partial demise won’t cost the planet much in terms of sea level rise, one expert said.

However, “it’s a smaller cousin to some truly gigantic — I mean size of the island of Britain — glaciers in Antarctica that could conceivably go through the same process, as this whole evolution of the ice sheets on Earth evolves with global warming,” a glaciologist added.

Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the research, said the new findings “raise the bar on our understanding of how fast Antarctic glaciers may retreat.”

These glaciers, especially the cavities beneath their ice shelves and tongues, are some of the most inaccessible environments on Earth, he told CNN, but knowing more about them is crucial to better project how they’ll respond to climate change. The research raises fears that ice loss from Antarctica, which contributes to sea-level rise, “could occur more rapidly than projected,” he said.

+Remember when all the billionaires were going to leave New York if Mamdani got elected? That didn’t happen—but a new survey shows that half of all Americans are thinking about moving because of climate change. That won’t happen on that scale either (among other things, it’s hard to sell a home where the insurance prices are rising fast) but I’m sure it will increasingly be a factor in where Americans live. The problem is, where to go?

For those considering a move to another state, more than half of respondents wanted to avoid disaster-prone states like Florida and California and preferred to move to what they perceived as low-risk states, including Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Connecticut.

Utility-scale projects account for 82% of 2025 installations. This segment continues to significantly outpace both residential and C&I installations, driven by large grid applications, renewable energy integration requirements, and government procurement programs.

By 2025, average utility-scale energy storage durations reached approximately 2.5 hours globally, with some markets like Chile and Saudi Arabia developing projects with durations exceeding 3-4 hours to address specific grid requirements.

The utility-scale segment's leadership position is expected to continue through 2034, with projections showing sustained strong growth across all major markets. The business case for utility-scale storage has strengthened considerably, supported by declining battery costs, improved project economics, and increasingly diverse revenue opportunities. Additionally, government-led tenders are driving deployment of utility storage systems. Even limited policy support can accelerate project development and provide investors with the confidence needed when fully merchant business cases appear too risky.

China remains the global leader of the energy storage market throughout the outlook

China emerged as the clear leader in global energy storage deployment in 2025, accounting for 54% of worldwide installations. This significant market concentration reflects China's ambitious renewable energy targets, mandatory renewable-storage coupling policies, and substantial domestic manufacturing capacity.

However, the Chinese market faces considerable challenges entering 2026-2027. The removal of mandatory renewable-storage coupling requirements and the absence of established revenue frameworks create substantial uncertainty. Despite these challenges, China's market is projected to contribute approximately 50% of new storage capacity between 2025 and 2034, maintaining its global leadership position.

US installations surge 53% in 2025 despite policy headwinds

The US demonstrated notable resilience in 2025, with installations growing 53% year-over-year despite federal policy changes. The passage of reconciliation legislation introduced supply chain restrictions for projects seeking federal tax credits, creating initial market uncertainty.

However, US large-scale forecast actually increased following the bill's passage, driven by announcements of domestic cell manufacturing facilities and committed large electricity loads. Developers accelerated construction on over 13 GW of ""safe harboured"" projects to qualify under previous policy frameworks.

Key growth drivers in US include capacity-constrained markets where storage provides critical reliability services, state-level incentives and mandates, and the country's first wave of battery augmentation projects. Approximately 12% of existing systems required capacity additions in 2025, creating a new market segment that is expected to expand significantly in the coming years.

Australia, Germany, Saudi Arabia emerge as key growth markets

Australia continued to exceed expectations with 55% growth, driven by the expanded Capacity Investment Scheme and successful state-level procurement auctions. Over 6.5 GW of capacity is currently under construction, with the National Electricity Market projected to host more than 30 GW of large-scale storage by 2034.

Germany maintained its position as Europe's distributed storage leader in 2025, supported by strong policy frameworks, high retail tariffs and the potential elimination of feed-in tariff schemes, which strengthens the business case for storage paired with existing distributed solar installations. Germany has also emerged as one of Europe's most active large-scale storage markets, as high power price volatility, increasing renewable energy penetration, and market liquidity drive demand for large-scale storage.

Saudi Arabia established itself as a significant new market with major gigawatt-scale projects, though some experienced delays. The Kingdom successfully commissioned four standalone projects in 2025 and has ambitious plans for continued expansion.

Market growth to moderate in 2026 before resuming long-term trajectory

While 2025's 43% growth rate was exceptional, the market is expected to moderate in 2026 due to policy transitions in the US and China. However, sustained long-term growth remains strong, supported by government tenders driving large-scale deployment and support schemes accelerating distributed segment adoption.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/2025/12/macro_energy_storage_gettyimages-1302632855.jpg?width=800&height=480&rmode=crop&rxy=0.5,0.5",N,,2026-01-13 11:02:04.591518

The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide.
In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide.","Ethylene oxide was once considered an unremarkable pollutant. The colorless gas seeped from relatively few industrial facilities and commanded little public attention.

All that changed in 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency completed a study that found the chemical is 30 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.

The agency then spent years updating regulations that protect millions of people who are most exposed to the compound. In 2024, the EPA approved stricter rules that require commercial sterilizers for medical equipment and large chemical plants to slash emissions of ethylene oxide, which causes lymphoma and breast cancer.

It was doing what the EPA has done countless times: revising rules based on new scientific knowledge.

Now, its ability to do that for many air pollutants is under threat.

In government records that have flown under the radar, President Donald Trump’s EPA said it is reconsidering whether the agency had the legal authority to update those rules.

Chemical companies and their trade organizations have argued that the EPA cannot reevaluate hazardous air pollution rules to account for newly discovered harms if it has revised them once already.

It doesn’t matter if decades have passed or new information has emerged.

If the EPA agrees, environmentalists fear that the decision could have wide implications, significantly curbing the EPA’s ability to limit nearly 200 pollutants from thousands of industrial plants. The next time new science reveals that a chemical is much more toxic, or that the amount of pollution released from a factory had been underestimated and would cause legally unacceptable health risks, the agency would not be able to react.

“It’s a poor reflection on this administration’s claim that they are actually interested in clean air,” said Ana Baptista, a professor of environmental policy and sustainability management at The New School. “By saying we’re no longer going to consider science, it’s abdicating your mission.”

The EPA didn’t address ProPublica’s questions about the ethylene oxide reevaluation or its broader implications. Instead, the agency pointed to a March press release about how it was reconsidering multiple air pollution rules issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, including the ones for chemical plants and commercial sterilizers. “EPA is committed to using the gold standard of science during these reviews,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.”

The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations. There’s a specific rule for oil refineries, for instance, and another for steel mills. Within eight years after each rule is published, the EPA is required to conduct an assessment, called a residual risk review, to decide if an update is necessary.

These assessments use detailed data on the quantity of emissions coming from each facility, the toxicity of each chemical and other information on how the chemicals are released and dispersed in the air. The combined data reveals how the emissions put local residents at risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive harm and other health problems.

If the EPA determines the overall risks exceed what’s allowed under the law, the agency must tighten the rules.

The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one. Nor does it specifically prohibit the agency from doing so.

As far back as 2006, the EPA under President George W. Bush asserted that the agency had the right to revisit and revise the rules based on risk.

The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide. The office estimated that nearly half a million Americans were exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from industrial emissions by chemical plants, commercial sterilizers and other facilities pumping out ethylene oxide.

In its report, the inspector general’s office advised the agency to “exercise its discretionary authority to conduct new residual risk reviews” as needed when “new data or information indicates an air pollutant is more toxic than previously determined.” (The inspector general was a Trump appointee.)

The EPA had already conducted the first, mandatory risk reviews for large chemical plants and commercial sterilizers in the early 2000s. In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide. Ultimately, the EPA determined the health risks were unacceptable and revised the rules to lower them. The agency asserted that the Clean Air Act “does not limit our discretion or authority to conduct another risk review should we consider that such review is warranted.”

According to the EPA’s estimates, the new regulations for chemical plants under the 2024 revised rule would cut the number of nearby residents who are exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from 90,000 to 3,000.

But the chemical industry opposed the stricter rules. Industry representatives disagreed with the EPA’s new assessment of ethylene oxide, contending that it overestimated the risk the chemical posed, and argued the agency didn’t have the authority to conduct those risk reviews. In a 2023 letter, the American Chemistry Council said “the Agency has erred in conducting a new risk review,” as “the plain text” of the Clean Air Act “indicates that EPA actually lacks this authority.”

Similarly, the Louisiana Chemical Association submitted public comments on the chemical plant rule stating the “EPA has no statutory authority to conduct a second risk review” and that doing so was “arbitrary and capricious.”

David Cresson, president and CEO of the association, told ProPublica that the trade group supports “protecting the public’s health through regulatory frameworks that are lawful, while remaining based in sound science.”

Brendan Bradley, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said the organization had no further comment on the issue.

After Trump was inaugurated, one of his appointees to the EPA let the industry know the agency was conducting a “reconsideration” of the two rules focused on ethylene oxide emissions. Last spring, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Abigale Tardif, a former oil and gas lobbyist, hinted at how the EPA might challenge those rules.

In letters addressed to trade groups representing commercial sterilizers and chemical plants, Tardif said the agency was reconsidering multiple issues related to the rules, including the “EPA’s authority and decision to undertake a second residual risk review” under the Clean Air Act, as well as “the analysis and determinations made in that review, and the resulting risk standards.”

Tardif didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The agency also filed a regulatory notice about its plans to revise the 2024 chemical plant rule. Citing the part of the Clean Air Act that deals with the updated rule assessments, the notice said the EPA had “identified items for reconsideration around its CAA section 112(f)(2) residual risk review authority.”

While the stricter ethylene oxide rules are technically still in effect, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of large chemical plants and sterilizer facilities from following them as the agency works through a formal process that is widely expected to result in watered-down standards.

If the Trump EPA does decide it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, the agency might still have the authority to strengthen hazardous air pollution rules by using a separate part of the Clean Air Act, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. That section of the act allows the EPA to update a rule if agency scientists conclude that better pollution-control technology is affordable and available. But limiting the agency’s ability to conduct residual risk reviews would be a serious blow to the act, Russ said, “kneecapping” the agency’s authority over these toxic pollutants.

Environmental groups will almost certainly sue if the EPA concludes it does not have the legal authority to revise hazardous air pollution rules more than once based on risk. Russ called industry’s comments absurd and said they don’t account for the reality that our knowledge of industrial pollution is changing all the time.

As ProPublica reported in October, the agency recently received clear evidence that many industrial facilities are leaking far more pollution than the companies that own them previously reported. In 2023, researchers who conducted their own air monitoring in the industrial corridor of Louisiana known as Cancer Alley found much higher concentrations of ethylene oxide than expected. For more than half the areas they sampled, the local cancer risk from ethylene oxide would be unacceptable if residents were exposed to these concentrations over a lifetime.

If the EPA decides it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, it would find itself in the position of not being able to take action even if the agency confirmed similar results.

“The whole premise of risk assessment is that it’s based on the best available science,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project. As our knowledge grows, researchers tend to find that chemicals are linked to additional health effects, she added, so blocking these updates “pretty much ensures” the EPA is underestimating the risks.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/valero-2-1024x6831768302623.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=GzhzYMz9,N,,2026-01-13 08:13:21.388202

,Congress,2026-01-13 11:01:59+00:00,Inside Climate News,Coal Communities Accuse Congress of Breaking Its Promise to Clean Up Abandoned Mine Lands,"Derek Harrison, Kiley Bense, Marianne Lavelle",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13012026/congress-bill-would-reduce-money-to-clean-abandoned-coal-mine-lands/,"“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.
“Congress is taking back money again to continue to punish the impoverished communities that have been suffering for a century,” he said.
“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.
“To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities.
“This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”","When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2021, authorizing more than $11 billion in new funding to reclaim lands and waterways damaged by abandoned coal mines, the people who lead this work on the ground were ecstatic.

“We were to the moon,” said Amanda Pitzer, the executive director at Friends of the Cheat, a nonprofit organization in West Virginia that works to restore the Cheat River watershed. “Once that big influx of money was announced, with West Virginia on track to receive $2.1 billion over those 15 years, we thought, ‘Now’s the time. Now’s the time to invest in water treatment.’”

But Congress wants to claw back some of that funding.

Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that would withdraw $500 million of the money allocated in 2021 for abandoned mine cleanup projects. The states that stand to lose the most are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, according to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, an environmental organization that works on conservation issues in central and southern Appalachia. The bill must still pass the Senate, which plans to take it up this week, and be signed by the president before it becomes law.

“We’re horribly disappointed,” Pitzer said. “Less money means less reclamation, period.” Among the projects that Pitzer’s organization champions are the building and maintenance of treatment systems that clean up acid mine drainage, a type of pollution that harms aquatic wildlife.

In West Virginia, she said, Abandoned Mine Land funding has also been used to help build public water lines in communities where pollution has affected drinking water supplies. Although significant progress has been made in cleaning up the Cheat River since the 1990s, much more work remains to be done, Pitzer said.

The House bill proposes using the siphoned funding to pay for wildland fire management and U.S. Forest Service operations. “I think it’s highly inappropriate of Congress to rob Peter to pay Paul,” said Andy McAllister, the regional coordinator of the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.

McAllister was particularly upset about the “yes” votes from Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation in the House. All but one member voted for the bill.

Pennsylvania has the most abandoned mines of any state, McAllister said. Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania have created a range of environmental and public safety problems, from underground fires and subsidence to sinkholes and pollution affecting more than 5,500 miles of waterways.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimated it would need $5 billion to fully remediate abandoned mine lands and the waterways they contaminated. Forty-five of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are impacted.

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.

Experts are worried that this “repurposing” of the fund could continue beyond this year, with Congress dipping into the money for other reasons. “The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said. “It just feels very shortsighted.”

Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices, said his group assumes that passing this bill will lead to an annual reduction in funding. Zedack and McAllister said they have not heard back from legislators they’ve reached out to with their concerns.

The offices of Pennsylvania’s senators, Republican Dave McCormick and Democrat John Fetterman, did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News.

Zedack and McAllister both pointed out that the loss of funding will harm local economies. Unremediated mine land can’t be used for development, for example.

“Projects that are funded through this provide jobs in historically depressed areas,” McAllister said. Those opportunities can help to offset job losses from the declining coal industry.

Joe Pizarchik, the former head of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which oversees AML funding, grew up in western Pennsylvania. The region is also losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue, he said. Many waterways are so impaired by mining pollution that they can’t be used for fishing or recreation.

Pizarchik said this isn’t the first time the federal government has reduced the funding available to help communities in coal country since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was first passed in 1977.

“There was a fee put in place on every ton of coal produced to help clean up the messes of the past,” he said. Over time, the fees have shrunk. “Congress is taking back money again to continue to punish the impoverished communities that have been suffering for a century,” he said.

“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. “To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities. We are living the impacts of this legacy.”

Pitzer agreed. “The program was initially structured to collect a fee to pay for sins of the past, and that money should stay in coal country. It should not be redirected to other needs and other places,” Pitzer said. “This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lick-Run-Sept-2019-2-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 06:59:33.187344

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.

The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support — or lack of it — for Trump “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.

The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”

Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.

Trump said in an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, last fall that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.

Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”

The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.

Partnership links data center power demand to advanced nuclear deployment

First units targeted as early as 2032 with Meta committing funding to support rollout

The future of American data infrastructure took a decisive turn this week as TerraPower and Meta unveiled a commercial agreement to deploy as many as eight Natrium advanced nuclear power plants across the United States. The plan could deliver up to 2.8 GW of carbon free baseload power for Meta, while Natrium’s energy storage capability would push total dispatchable output as high as 4 GW. Initial units could come online in 2032, positioning nuclear energy as a new backbone for digital operations.

Under the agreement Meta will provide funding to support deployment of the Natrium units. TerraPower will identify a site for an initial dual reactor unit in the coming months.

An Unusual Convergence: Nuclear Meets Data Center Demand

Advanced nuclear developers have courted industrials and utilities for years. The pivot toward hyperscale data firms reflects a shift in the US power market. Artificial intelligence, cloud computing and content distribution have driven a rapid acceleration in firm electricity needs. Renewable power alone cannot always meet the round the clock requirements for data infrastructure without large scale storage or thermal backups.

TerraPower president and chief executive Chris Levesque set out the objective directly. “To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon free power our country needs,” he said. He added that TerraPower has completed design work, secured supply chains and cleared major regulatory steps. “These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi unit delivery agreement.”

Meta framed the deal as a strategic step toward sourcing reliable clean energy for both operations and local communities. “Meta is committed to supporting innovative energy solutions that can deliver reliable, scalable, and clean power for our operations and the communities we serve,” said Urvi Parekh, director of global energy at Meta. “This agreement with TerraPower, the result of Meta’s nuclear RFP process which identified leading developers of nuclear energy to help us advance our energy goals, marks a significant step forward in advancing next generation nuclear technology. Supporting new nuclear energy generation spurs job growth, drives innovation in our local communities, and reinforces America’s leadership in energy technology.”

Technology Profile and Regulatory Status

Each Natrium reactor produces 345 MW of baseload electricity and can ramp up to 500 MW for more than five hours through an integrated storage system. A dual unit delivers 690 MW of firm capacity and can reach 1 GW when drawing from storage. The combination offers both steady output and dispatchable supply, attributes highly valued in markets with variable renewable generation.

TerraPower has already begun construction on its first commercial scale Natrium facility in the United States, targeted for completion in 2030. Natrium is currently the only commercial advanced nuclear design with a completed environmental impact statement and final safety review as part of a construction permit application pending with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That regulatory position matters for investors, since capital deployment in nuclear hinges on licensing visibility, supply chain readiness and political sentiment.

Implications for C Suite and Investors

Corporate power deals are no longer restricted to virtual renewable PPAs. The TerraPower Meta arrangement hints at a new class of energy procurement in which hyperscale firms seek on site or dedicated firm clean power. If the model proves viable it could draw in other digital and industrial buyers whose demand curves favor nuclear and geothermal assets rather than intermittent renewables alone.

The deal also carries geopolitical weight. The United States aims to rebuild influence in nuclear technology after decades of stagnation as China and Russia expanded overseas offerings. Domestic commercialization in advanced reactors would strengthen export prospects, high skilled jobs and fuel supply chains.

The question for global executives is whether data infrastructure will change the economics of nuclear deployment. If so, advanced nuclear could join renewables, hydrocarbons and storage as a fourth pillar of energy security for digital economies.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk.
And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.
The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech.","Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.

No matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

It’s an issue well known to Ohioans. Ohio is home to over 200 data centers, one of the highest figures in the country, and recent reporting has tied that growth to rising utility prices in the state.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267 percent from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74 percent between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40 percent in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100 percent renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2158463644-2048x1281.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 06:59:24.736009

Last year, the state gave DeepRock permits to drill two more injection wells for pumping such waste underground. The new wells are slated for rural Washington County, which sits on Ohio’s southeast border.

The state’s approval has drawn fierce opposition from surrounding community members and local governments that fear waste from the wells could escape and pollute their drinking water supply. Leaks have happened before, including from some DeepRock wells. But these opponents haven’t been able to stop the company’s latest drilling plans.

This lack of local authority highlights an unfair discrepancy in Ohio, according to legal experts and clean energy advocates: While state law allows counties, townships, and disgruntled residents’ groups to delay or even doom many solar and wind developments, it blocks almost all local decision-making power over fossil fuel endeavors.

The difference between how Ohio law deals with renewables and petroleum ​“is night and day,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.

On one hand, state law gives the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ​“sole and exclusive authority” to permit oil and gas activities. ​“So the local governments are cut out entirely,” Robertson explained, noting a 2015 Ohio Supreme Court decision that held that the state’s comprehensive regulation of oil and gas activities preempts even city zoning ordinances that would otherwise restrict that work.

On the other hand, a 2021 law lets counties ban new solar and wind development for most of their territory. Even for ​“grandfathered” projects that are technically exempt from such bans, the Ohio Power Siting Board has used opposition from local governments as grounds for finding such developments were not in the ​“public interest.”

“What you have looks like total inconsistency” when it comes to deciding which energy projects should go where, Robertson said.

That has serious implications for the energy transition: It holds back the projects that would slash planet-warming and health-harming pollution while further entrenching the lead that the oil and gas industry has in Ohio’s electricity sector.

Ohio also treats renewables differently than it does fossil fuel projects when it comes to letting the community participate in permitting decisions. The state lets disgruntled residents intervene as official parties in wind- and solar-permitting cases, which allows those individuals to appeal permit approvals to the Ohio Supreme Court. Yet residents cannot intervene or appeal in cases about where oil and gas activities go.

Advocacy groups such as the Buckeye Environmental Network say this imbalance is making communities like Washington County, where DeepRock plans to inject more fracking waste, less safe.

Fracking — a drilling technique to extract fossil fuels from rocks thousands of feet deep — produces millions of barrels of waste per year. Regular wastewater treatment plants can’t handle those super-salty fluids, which can contain heavy metals, radioactive chemicals, and company ​“trade secret” compounds. That’s why the waste is typically disposed of in deep wells.

Ohio had more than 200 active fracking-waste injection wells as of late 2024, with several already in Washington County.

Marietta, a city of about 13,000 on the Ohio River, abuts Warren Township, where DeepRock will drill the new wells. The city’s leaders worry that the waste could migrate out of the rock layer where it will be stored. A 2019 investigation found that waste had escaped from another injection well in Washington County, although it wasn’t discovered in drinking water at that time.

The Marietta City Council passed a resolution in October that noted problems with waste escaping from other wells, and it urged the state to place a moratorium on disposing of more fracking waste in the area. The city also tried to appeal one of DeepRock’s permits, but the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management at the Department of Natural Resources responded that its Oil and Gas Commission, which reviews those administrative appeals, lacks jurisdiction for Marietta’s claims.

“People are saying we don’t want these injection wells,” said Roxanne Groff, an advisory board member of the Buckeye Environmental Network. ​“And the main reason is the water.”

Groff’s group is taking another approach to stopping the DeepRock project: It’s suing leaders at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources over the permits issued for the wells. The lawsuit, filed in November, argues the agency illegally relied on outdated regulations that were in effect when DeepRock first filed for its permits but that were replaced in 2022 by stricter rules meant to better protect public safety and health.

“The law is very clear in our view that [the department] should be applying the rules in place at the time of permitting,” said James Yskamp, a senior attorney at the nonprofit Earthjustice, which is representing the Buckeye Environmental Network. When DeepRock applied for its permits in late 2021, the current siting rules were already in draft form, and the public comment period on them had ended. Moreover, the agency didn’t complete technical reviews, provide public notice about the permits, or accept comments on them until last year.

Karina Cheung, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources, said her agency has no comment on pending litigation. But she did note that any permit to operate the wells after they’re drilled will need to comply with current rules in the Ohio Administrative Code. That permit would control how the company pumps waste underground under pressure, but not where that waste goes. And the wells would already have been drilled.

Lawyers for the officials at the Department of Natural Resources and for DeepRock want the case dismissed. The department had no duty to apply the current law, the filings claim. And any harm is speculative, they argue, because it wouldn’t happen until after fracking waste is pumped down.

The Buckeye Environmental Network’s petition before the Franklin County Court of Appeals indicates the two DeepRock wells are approximately 2 miles from protected groundwater resources for people in the city of Marietta and Warren Township. Already-operating wells in the area pump tens of thousands of gallons of fracking waste underground each day. Injecting yet more fluids under high pressure could cause waste to migrate out of deep rock layers and up through rock fissures, abandoned wells, or other conduits, the group alleges.

These concerns are founded on evidence, Groff noted, unlike people’s objections to solar projects, which she said tend to be lacking in factual support or based on false information.

Robertson at Cleveland State has the numbers to back up that claim: She analyzed the grounds for testimony against a utility-scale solar project in a permitting case in 2024. Most objections either had no basis in fact or had already been addressed by permit conditions. The rest were statements of opinion.

To the extent there is any consistency in how Ohio treats different types of energy projects, ​“it’s that the oil and gas industry wins every time,” Robertson said. ​“The oil and gas industry benefits by blocking local voices in oil and gas industry decisions. And the oil and gas industry benefits by having local voices involved in the wind- and solar-energy decision-making.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Youngstown-OH-fracking-well_GettyImages-2203454010.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e548faa4378c59e3334721c5fdcfac10,N,,2026-01-13 07:59:34.294819

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first, taking place Monday on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted is building Revolution Wind with partner Skyborn Renewables to provide power to Rhode Island and Connecticut.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind, said they want to build this project, the construction is advanced and it will deliver a major new and essential source of power for New York. Morris said federal officials have not given them any explanation of the national security concerns or how to mitigate them.

“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” she said.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

[5] However, Section 1342 (p) provided that the EPA could not require a permit for “discharges composed entirely of storm water” except for certain exceptions.
To avoid this outcome, companies should evaluate their operations to determine if they have discharges associated with industrial activity.
Such counsel can assist in engaging a consultant with NPDES experience to evaluate the operation and determine whether stormwater is discharging from areas associated with industrial activity into navigable waters.
Experienced consultants can also describe and estimate the effort and expense required for permit compliance, such as preparing the required Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”), monitoring, reporting, and taking steps to mitigate the discharge of pollutants in stormwater.","Four Massachusetts[1] waste handlers recently learned that when it rains, it pours, when they agreed to pay the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) a total of $170,000 in penalties for alleged stormwater discharges in violation of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA).[2] According to their Consent Agreement and Final Order (“CAFO”) with the EPA, the handlers failed to obtain the required stormwater discharge permits from the EPA. This post aims to alert similar companies to the need to evaluate whether they are subject to permit requirements and, if so, provide guidance on obtaining such permits to avoid similar enforcement action.

Under section 1311 of the CWA, the “discharge of any pollutant[3] by any person shall be unlawful.”[4] Section 1342 (a) of the Act authorized EPA to establish a permit program known as the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) to allow discharges of pollutants.[5] However, Section 1342 (p) provided that the EPA could not require a permit for “discharges composed entirely of storm water” except for certain exceptions. One of those exceptions was for “discharges associated with industrial activity.”[6]

The EPA’s NPDES regulations define “storm water discharge associated with industrial activity” as “the discharge from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water, and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing, or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.” [7] Although the regulation applies only to “industrial plants,” it lists eleven “categories of facilities” deemed associated with industrial activity, some of which would not ordinarily be considered “industrial plants” that must nevertheless obtain NPDES stormwater discharge permits.[8] Relevant to the EPA’s enforcement in this case, the regulation specifically includes the following categories of facilities:

(vi) Facilities involved in the recycling of materials, including metal scrapyards, battery reclaimers, salvage yards, and automobile junkyards, including but limited to those classified as Standard Industrial Classification 5015 and 5093.

(vii) Transportation facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classifications 40, 41, 42 (except 4221-25), 43, 44, 45, and 5171, which have vehicle maintenance shops, equipment cleaning operations, or airport deicing operations. Only those portions of the facility that are either involved in vehicle maintenance (including vehicle rehabilitation, mechanical repairs, painting, fueling, and lubrication), equipment cleaning operations, airport deicing operations, or which are otherwise identified under paragraphs (b)(14) (i)-(vii) or (ix)-(xi) of this section are associated with industrial activity.

The regulation casts a wide net over operations at these categories of facilities that are “associated with industrial activities,” including, for example, “immediate access roads and rail lines,” “material handling sites,” and “sites used for the storage and maintenance of material handling equipment.” [9] However, “the term excludes areas located on plant lands separate from the plant’s industrial activities, such as office buildings and accompanying parking lots, as long as the drainage from the excluded areas is not mixed with storm water drained from the above described areas.”[10]

The CAFO states that the four Massachusetts waste handlers self-identified their facilities as having SIC codes that fall in one of the categories of facilities listed in the regulation (specifically SIC codes 5093, 4212, and 4011). As noted, the waste handlers failed to file the required EPA documentation (a Notice of Intent or “NOI”) to be covered by the General Permit[11] that EPA had made available for such facilities.[12] It appears from the CAFO that upon becoming aware of EPA’s enforcement, each targeted handler filed such a Notice of Intent to come into compliance. [13]

Although not the case here, in addition to the EPA itself, not-for-profit groups, Massachusetts regulators, and the Office of the Attorney General regularly scour the EPA’s databases for categories of industrial operations to identify individual companies that are likely out of compliance and bring citizen claims for enforcement. To avoid this outcome, companies should evaluate their operations to determine if they have discharges associated with industrial activity. If so, environmental counsel may help evaluate the legal requirements. Such counsel can assist in engaging a consultant with NPDES experience to evaluate the operation and determine whether stormwater is discharging from areas associated with industrial activity into navigable waters. Experienced consultants can also describe and estimate the effort and expense required for permit compliance, such as preparing the required Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”), monitoring, reporting, and taking steps to mitigate the discharge of pollutants in stormwater. After completing this evaluation, counsel can work with the client and consultant to determine the next best steps to come into compliance and reduce the risk of enforcement.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15909_3029.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 12:01:05.262248

He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

Create thousands of construction and long-term operational jobs, boosting local economic growth.

The Oklo nuclear energy project is advancing in Southern Ohio through a new agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc. This partnership supports Oklo’s plan to develop a 1.2 gigawatt (GW) power campus in Pike County. Meta’s funding allows Oklo to secure fuel and prepare the site. Consequently, the project strengthens clean, reliable power for the region and supports Meta’s data centre operations.

Phase 1 will occupy 206 acres in Pike County. Oklo purchased the land with support from the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI). SODI promotes regional development and converts former government sites for energy and industrial purposes. Therefore, the partnership drives both clean energy growth and local economic revitalisation.

Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s CEO, highlighted the project’s workforce impact: “This agreement with Meta supports constructing advanced nuclear reactors and creating long-term, high-quality jobs.” Oklo will start pre-construction activities and site characterisation in 2026. Phase 1 is expected to come online by 2030, with the facility scaling to 1.2 GW by 2034.

Ohio’s location within the PJM interconnection strengthens the project’s strategic value. The state’s strong transmission network positions it as a hub for clean energy growth. As demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure rises, Oklo allows large energy users to fund a new generation while supporting grid stability. Meta’s investment ensures the region receives reliable power for all energy customers.

Urvi Parekh of Meta emphasised the broader impact: “This project creates jobs, encourages innovation, and strengthens American energy leadership. Investing in baseload nuclear energy ensures a resilient, sustainable future.” SODI also redevelops the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant into a hub for clean energy and advanced manufacturing.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/oklo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 03:58:02.217757

In 2024, the top 10 countries accounted for a cumulative 6 million solar jobs or 82% of the global total.
Yet the world’s largest solar PV jobs market saw its employment numbers slide from 4.59 million in 2023.
However, these figures are lower than the record high of 865,000 solar jobs reported in 2024 in the EU member states, according to SolarPower Europe’s (SPE) EU Solar Jobs Report 2025, led by Germany.
SPE projects a decline in EU solar jobs in 2025 to around 825,000 in 2025, before recovering to reach close to 916,000 by 2029 (see EU Solar Jobs Hit Record 865,000 But Decline Looms).","Global renewable energy installations in 2024 grew to 16.6 million, representing an increase of 2.3% annually, led by solar PV’s 7.24 million, say the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and International Labour Organization (ILO) in a new report.

While renewable energy installations grew substantially in 2024 to 582 GW, jobs in the sector registered a smaller increase. This, IRENA observes, is due to the increasing impact of geopolitical and geoeconomic frictions, as well as growing automation, on the renewable energy workforce.

Solar energy jobs increased from 7.11 million in 2023 (see IRENA & ILO Release Renewable Energy And Jobs – Annual Review 2024).

In 2024, the top 10 countries accounted for a cumulative 6 million solar jobs or 82% of the global total. Among these, 6 are in Asia, accounting for 75% of the world’s PV jobs; 2 are in Europe, with 11.3% (the EU accounting for 10.6%); and 2 are in the Americas, holding 9.6% of the global share. Others made up the remaining 3.7%.

“Pakistan, Germany, Türkiye and Italy all ranked among the top ten, driven by strong growth in both distributed and utility-scale solar markets,” according to the IRENA report.

In 2024, China continued to lead in global PV employment as it accounted for 58% of the global PV employment, or some 4.2 million jobs, especially since it represents the lion’s share of manufacturing jobs. As the world’s solar PV manufacturing factory, China accounted for 81.6% of all PV modules produced globally in 2024. China is also supplying modules to the rest of the world.

With trade tensions and tariffs imposed in some geographies, such as the US and India, China is diversifying its markets to include Brazil, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Africa, among others. This means these markets are creating jobs in construction and installation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) rather than manufacturing.

Yet the world’s largest solar PV jobs market saw its employment numbers slide from 4.59 million in 2023. IRENA refers to the China Renewable Energy Society, which observes the most significant reductions in employment in PV modules and related auxiliary materials, while other equipment manufacturers expanded their workforce.

Europe’s estimated PV jobs totaled 821,200, including 764,400 in EU member states, according to IRENA, which bases its estimates on a combination of national and regional reports and employment factor calculations.

However, these figures are lower than the record high of 865,000 solar jobs reported in 2024 in the EU member states, according to SolarPower Europe’s (SPE) EU Solar Jobs Report 2025, led by Germany. Deployment accounted for 86% of the jobs, followed by 7.7% in O&M, 4.7% in manufacturing, and 1.6% in decommissioning and recycling. SPE projects a decline in EU solar jobs in 2025 to around 825,000 in 2025, before recovering to reach close to 916,000 by 2029 (see EU Solar Jobs Hit Record 865,000 But Decline Looms).

India, on the other hand, had an estimated 384,900 solar jobs according to IRENA, while the US had close to 280,100 jobs.

“Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. “This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socio-economic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition.”

The 12th edition of the report also calls for increasing work opportunities in the renewable energy industry for women and people with disabilities. It points to the lack of human dimension in this conversation, which, more often than not, is limited to technology, costs, and capacity targets. The renewable energy space is set to become more digitized, and new technologies like robots, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI) may reduce the number of jobs.

To ensure a skilled workforce for the industry, workers must be upskilled and retrained to meet the ever-evolving job needs. However, it adds, the focus should be not only on the number of jobs, but also on job quality and security.

“A just transition demands that no population groups—such as women and people with disabilities—are left at the margins. The renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives. To this day, both groups’ potential remains under-utilised, which calls for deliberate, multifaceted and systemic action,” state IRENA and ILO.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2026-01-13%2Fghuxyj8n%2FIRENA-jobs.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-13 07:59:52.723768

In a decision on Monday, US District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s actions violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily – if not exclusively – based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a summary of the case.

The grants were intended to support hundreds of clean energy projects across 16 states, including California, Colorado, New Jersey and Washington state. The projects included initiatives to create battery plants and hydrogen technology.

But projects in those states were cancelled in October, as the Trump administration sought to ratchet up pressure on Democratic-led states during a heated government shutdown.

At the time, Trump told the network One America News (OAN) that he would take aim at projects closely associated with the Democratic Party.

“We could cut projects that they wanted, favourite projects, and they’d be permanently cut,” he told the network.

Russell Vought, the Trump-appointed director for the Office of Management and Budget, posted on social media that month that “funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” had been “cancelled”.

The cuts included up to $1.2bn for a hub in California aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology, and up to $1bn for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest.

St Paul, Minnesota, was among the jurisdictions affected by the grant cuts. The city and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit to contest the Trump administration’s decision.

Second legal setback

A spokesperson for the US Department of Energy, however, said the Trump administration disagrees with the judge’s ruling.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars”, spokesman Ben Dietderich said.

The Trump administration has repeatedly pledged to cut back on what it considers wasteful government spending.

Monday’s ruling was the second legal setback in just a matter of hours for Trump’s efforts to roll back the clean energy programmes in the US.

A separate federal judge ruled on Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

The US president campaigned for the White House on a promise to end the offshore wind industry, saying electric wind turbines – sometimes called windmills – are too expensive and hurt whales and birds.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP22055617825181-1768276087.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-13 09:59:28.797569

The report was released on Jan. 11, on the eve of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2026, held in the UAE capital under the patronage of Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed clean energy champion.

As in previous years, uneven development persists worldwide. According to the report, China remains at the forefront in both generating capacity deployment and equipment manufacturing, mainly due to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices. In 2024, China created an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, or 44% of the global total.

According to the report, the EU followed suit, with employment remaining unchanged from 2023 at 1.8 million jobs. Brazil’s renewable energy employment reached 1.4 million, whereas India’s and the United States’ figures increased modestly, from around 1 million to 1.3 million and 1.1 million, respectively.

In Non-EU Europe and Eurasia, Türkiye stands out as a regional outlier, recording rapid growth in both solar and wind power alongside a fast-expanding domestic manufacturing base, which IRENA estimates supported more than 120,000 renewable energy jobs in 2024. In the Caucasus, Armenia and Azerbaijan report smaller but measurable employment, mainly in solar, hydropower, and waste-to-energy, while Georgia’s renewable workforce remains anchored in hydropower, underscoring uneven visibility and development across the region. No data were available for Kazakhstan or Central Asia.

Commenting on the trend, IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera said it is important for governments to put people at the centre of energy and climate objectives that drive investment, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain. He also pointed to uneven geographical progress, which he said calls for stronger international collaboration.

“Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community. This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socio-economic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition,” he said.

According to the report, solar photovoltaics (PV) retained the lead in employment by technology, driven by the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing. The industry employed 7.3 million people in 2024. Asian countries accounted for 75% of global PV jobs, with China alone accounting for 4.2 million jobs.

Liquid biofuels ranked second to solar PV, generating 2.6 million jobs in 2024, with 46.5% of those positions in Asia. Hydropower ranked third with 2.3 million jobs, followed by wind energy with 1.9 million.

Beyond the headline numbers, the report underscored the need for greater inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce. It found that women continue to face barriers to hiring and career advancement, while people with disabilities are only beginning to gain broader access to employment opportunities.

ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo reiterated that accessibility for persons with disabilities, who often face barriers despite their skills, experience, and talent, must be built into every stage of policy design and implementation.

“This requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker’s rights. Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice; it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development,” he said.",https://astanatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2629713913-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 00:58:03.410398

The forthcoming announcement would mark an about-face for FEMA officials, who repeatedly resisted calls to test properties for toxic substances after federal contractors finished removing fire debris. The new testing initiative follows reporting by The Times that workers repeatedly violated cleanup protocols, possibly leaving fire contaminants behind or moving them into unwanted areas, according to federal reports.

The EPA plan, presented to a small group of environmental experts and community members on Jan. 5, said the agency would randomly select 100 sites from the 5,600 homes that had burned down in the Eaton fire and where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the removal of ash, debris and a layer of soil. The soil samples would be collected near the surface and about 6 inches below ground.

They examined potential ammonia flows across 63 countries and considered a variety of country-specific economic parameters as well as low- and no-carbon ammonia production technologies.
Although current ammonia production is energy-intensive and polluting (referred to as gray ammonia), ammonia can also be produced sustainably using renewable sources (green ammonia) or with natural gas and carbon sequestration (blue ammonia).

For one thing, ammonia is energy-dense and carbon-free. It is also already produced at scale and shipped around the world, primarily for use in fertilizer.

Though current manufacturing processes give ammonia an enormous carbon footprint, cleaner ways to make ammonia do exist. A better understanding of how to guide the ammonia fuel industry’s continued development could improve carbon emissions, energy costs, and regional energy balances.

In a new paper, MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) researchers created the largest combined dataset showing the economic and environmental impact of global ammonia supply chains under different scenarios. They examined potential ammonia flows across 63 countries and considered a variety of country-specific economic parameters as well as low- and no-carbon ammonia production technologies. The results should help researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders calculate the cost and lifecycle emissions of different ammonia production technologies and trade routes.

“This is the most comprehensive work on the global ammonia landscape,” says senior author Guiyan Zang, a research scientist at MITEI. “We developed many of these frameworks at MIT to be able to make better cost-benefit analyses. Hydrogen and ammonia are the only two types of fuel with no carbon at scale. If we want to use fuel to generate power and heat, but not release carbon, hydrogen and ammonia are the only options, and ammonia is easier to transport and lower-cost.”

The study provides the clearest view yet of the tradeoffs associated with various ammonia production technologies. The researchers found, for instance, that a full transition to ammonia produced using conventional processes paired with carbon capture could cut global greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 71 percent for a 23.2 percent cost increase. A transition to electrolyzed ammonia produced using renewable energy could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 99.7 percent for a 46 percent cost increase.

“Before this, there were no harmonized datasets quantifying the impacts of this transition,” says lead author Woojae Shin, a postdoc at MITEI. “Everyone is talking about ammonia as a super important hydrogen carrier in the future, and also ammonia can be directly used in power generation or fertilizer and other industrial uses. But we needed this dataset. It’s filling a major knowledge gap.”

The paper appears in Energy and Environmental Science. Former MITEI postdocs Haoxiang Lai and Gasim Ibrahim are also co-authors.

Filling a data gap

Today ammonia is mainly produced through the Haber-Bosch process, which in 2020 was responsible for about 1.8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Although current ammonia production is energy-intensive and polluting (referred to as gray ammonia), ammonia can also be produced sustainably using renewable sources (green ammonia) or with natural gas and carbon sequestration (blue ammonia).

As ammonia has increasingly attracted interest as a carbon-free energy source and a medium for hydrogen transport, it’s become more important to quantify the costs and life-cycle emissions associated with various ammonia production technologies, as well as ammonia storage and shipping routes. But existing studies were too narrowly focused.

“The previous studies and datasets were fragmented,” Shin says. “They focused on specific regions or single technologies, like gray ammonia only, or blue ammonia only. They would also only cover the cost or the greenhouse emissions of ammonia in isolation. Finally, they use different scopes and methodologies. It meant you couldn’t make global comparisons or draw definitive conclusions.”

To build their database, the MIT researchers combined data from dozens of studies analyzing specific technologies, regions, economic parameters, and trade flows. They also used frameworks they previously developed to calculate the total cost of ammonia production in each country and estimated lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain, factoring in storage and shipping between different regions.

Emissions calculations included activities related to feedstock extraction, production, transport, and import processing. Major cost factors included each country’s renewable and grid electricity prices, natural gas prices, and location. Other factors like interest rates and equity premiums were also included.

The researchers used their calculations to find ammonia costs and life cycle emissions across six ammonia production technologies. In the context of the U.S. average, they found the lowest production cost came from using a popular form of the Haber Bosch process known as natural gas steam methane reforming (SMR) without carbon capture and storage (gray ammonia), at 48 cents per kilogram of ammonia. Unfortunately, that economic advantage came with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, at 2.46 kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of ammonia. In contrast, SMR with carbon capture and storage achieves an approximately 61 percent reduction in emissions while incurring a 29 percent increase in production costs.

Another method for producing ammonia that uses natural gas as a feedstock called auto-thermal reforming (ATR) with air combustion, when combined with carbon capture and storage, exhibited a 10 percent higher cost than conventional SMR while generating emissions of 0.75 kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of ammonia, representing a more cost-effective decarbonization option than SMR with carbon capture and storage.

Among production pathways including carbon capture (blue ammonia), a variation of ATR that uses oxygen combustion and carbon capture had the lowest emissions, with a production cost of about 57 cents per kilogram of ammonia. Producing ammonia with electricity generally had higher production costs than blue ammonia pathways. When nuclear energy is powering ammonia production, as opposed to the grid, greenhouse gas emissions are near zero at 0.03 kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of ammonia produced.

Across the 63 countries studied, major cost and emissions differences were driven by energy costs, sources of energy for the grid, and financing environments. China emerged as an optimal future supplier of green ammonia to many countries, while the Middle East also offered competitive low-carbon ammonia production pathways. Generally, blue ammonia pathways are most attractive for countries with low-cost natural gas resources, and ammonia made using grid electricity proved more expensive and more carbon-intensive than conventionally produced ammonia.

From data to policy

Low-carbon ammonia use is projected to grow dramatically by 2050, with that ammonia procured via global trade. Japan and Korea, for example, have included ammonia in their national energy strategies and conducted trials using ammonia to generate power. They even offer economic credits for verified CO2 reductions from clean ammonia projects.

“Ammonia researchers, producers, as well as government officials require this data to understand the impact of different technologies and global supply corridors,” Shin says.

The authors also believe industry stakeholders and other researchers will get a lot of value from their database, which allows users to explore the impact of changing specific parameters.

“We collaborate with companies, and they need to know the full costs and lifecycle emissions associated with different options,” Zang says. “Governments can also use this to compare options and set future policies. Any country producing ammonia needs to know which countries they can deliver to economically.”

Petitions filed urged the EPA to toughen air permit renewal requirements for steel mills and oil refineries and do more to address air pollution. They say the permits failed to include Clean Air Act requirements such as testing, recordkeeping and clear and enforceable monitoring.

Environmental Law & Policy Center Associate Attorney Kerri Gefeke said, “U.S. EPA should object to these permits because they’re inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and The Region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.

The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support — or lack of it — for Trump “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.

The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday, “Once again, a court has struck down Trump’s senseless stop work order on Revolution Wind because the administration has failed to produce a single shred of evidence to support its fantastical claims.

“After losing in court once already, Trump seems intent on costing Connecticut workers thousands of jobs and raising electric prices for Connecticut consumers. This repeated effort to stop a project—already nearly 90% complete—plainly flouts laws, facts and public interest. His vengeance is just plain cruel and stupid. He should abandon this insane campaign and get out of the way,” Blumenthal said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, said “A federal judge has once again blocked Trump’s efforts to tank Revolution Wind, finding yet again that his actions are likely arbitrary and capricious and that our challenge is likely to succeed.

“This project is on the finish line to begin delivering clean, affordable energy to Connecticut families. With yet another clear defeat, it is my hope that Donald Trump will drop his lawless and erratic attacks for good. We’re prepared to keep fighting—and winning– for as long as it takes to protect Connecticut ratepayers, workers and our environment,” said Tong in a statement.

U.S. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, said, “A federal judge has confirmed that Trump’s latest attempt to halt Revolution Wind – a project that is over 80 percent complete – is illegal. For months now, this administration has recklessly attempted to stop a project that not only provides good-paying jobs, but would also power over 300,000 homes and deliver lower energy costs to Connecticut residents and businesses.

“Thank you to Attorney General Tong for fighting the persistent and absurd delays coming from this administration. I’m glad that work may now continue on this critical project and look forward to its completion.”

A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”

Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.

Trump said in an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, last fall that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.

Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”

The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.

“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-CFPB_46753_7e5090.jpg?w=1024&h=685,N,,2026-01-13 00:58:08.702551

The delegation will be in Copenhagen Friday, January 16, and Saturday, January 17. Some members of the delegation will continue on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

In Copenhagen, the delegation is expected to meet with Danish and Greenlandic government and business leaders. The trip will highlight bipartisan support for our allies in the Kingdom of Denmark and discuss how to deepen this partnership in line with our shared principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and in the face of growing challenges around the world, especially bolstering Arctic security and promoting stronger trade relations between the two countries.

Additional members are expected to join the delegation as well.

“I’m proud to lead this congressional delegation to Copenhagen to demonstrate strong bipartisan and bicameral support in Congress for our Danish NATO ally,” said Senator Coons. “Denmark has always been a strong diplomatic, economic, and security partner who sacrificed more lives than any other country relative to its population when the United States invoked Article 5 following the September 11 attacks. At a time of increasing international instability, we need to draw closer to our allies, not drive them away, and this delegation will send a clear message that Congress is committed to NATO and our network of alliances.”

“Denmark is a trusted NATO ally and an essential partner to the United States on security, trade, and shared democratic values,” said Senator Tillis. “As co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, I believe it is critical that Congress stands united in supporting our allies and respecting the sovereignty of Denmark and Greenland, especially given Denmark’s early and steadfast support for the U.S. after the attacks of September 11, 2001. This delegation reflects a bipartisan commitment to strengthening security, expanding economic cooperation, and reaffirming the enduring alliance between the United States and Denmark.”

“Now more than ever, the U.S.-Denmark partnership and the NATO alliance more broadly are foundational to America’s national security amid rising threats to the transatlantic alliance,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m proud to join this delegation to reiterate our nation’s commitment to Denmark, Greenland and NATO. Amid emerging threats in both the Arctic and Indo-Pacific, it is essential that the United States continues to confront the challenges of the 21st century in strong partnership with Denmark and our NATO allies.”

“President Trump’s continued threats toward Greenland are unnecessary and would only weaken our NATO alliance,” said Senator Durbin. “Denmark is a strong partner of the United States and this bipartisan CODEL reiterates that the United States Congress stands firm in our partnership, despite the president’s advances.”

“This bipartisan delegation will reinforce the Kingdom of Denmark’s importance as an ally who has stood by us during our hours of greatest need, as well as the commitment of the United States Congress to the NATO alliance as a whole,” said Representative Meeks. “Denmark and Greenland have been clear: Greenland and its people are not for sale. Our collective security must be achieved through diplomacy and cooperation, not by threats and coercion. I look forward to meeting with officials in Copenhagen to strengthen our partnership and make clear that Congress’ commitment to Denmark and NATO is ironclad.”

“NATO isn’t obsolete or a waste of money; it’s a vital investment in keeping the American people safe,” said Representative Jacobs. “With partner nations like Denmark, we help keep each other safe by pooling information and capabilities – magnifying our power and making us stronger together than on our own. That’s why I’m proud to join this bipartisan and bicameral delegation to send a clear message that Congress is unwavering in its commitment to our NATO partners and allies and we oppose President Trump’s aggressive efforts to acquire Greenland, whether by force or not.”",https://www.coons.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coons_Logo_Social.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 04:59:14.549717

After last year’s additions, 10% of Aurora’s licensed motorized fleet is now electric or hybrid, Linville told The Beacon-News. The city departments and divisions currently using electric vehicles include police, fire prevention, street maintenance, water and sewer, downtown services, central services, property standards, engineering and water production, he said.

The city also increased its electric vehicle charging capacity by 90%, the city news release said, with nine new dual-port Level 2 chargers installed in 2025.

“This award is a result of some of the small steps we have taken towards a more sustainable Aurora,” Mayor John Laesch said in the news release. “We will continue charting a more robust path towards energy efficiency programs that save more money for home and business owners in Aurora.”

At a committee meeting last week, Laesch presented Linville with a Mayor’s Award of Excellence for bringing in the Illinois Alliance for Clean Transportation award. Laesch said it was important that the city recognize Linville’s hard work, and he also recognized the city’s grant writers for helping fund the initiative and all the employees who had to adjust to getting a new type of vehicle.

As a result of the fleet upgrades, which were led by the city’s fleet maintenance, electrical maintenance and purchasing divisions, Aurora is seeing lower fuel use, reduced idling and emissions and longer periods between required fleet maintenance, according to the news release.

Investing in fuel-efficient vehicles is one of the goals stated in the city’s 2019 Sustainability Plan. And in a video posted to Aurora’s YouTube channel in September, Linville said the Public Works Department has a “green fleet policy” that prioritizes the purchase of the most fuel-efficient or eco-friendly vehicle possible for a given role.

Aside from the reduced emissions, electric vehicles are also simpler to maintain, Linville said in the video. There’s a lot less moving parts, he said, and they don’t require oil changes.

Director of Sustainability Alison Lindburg said in the September YouTube video that, when it comes to climate change, it is important to address the transportation sector. About a third of Aurora’s greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, she said.

“That’s why it’s important for people with their own personal vehicles, or with a city fleet, to be looking at EVs as a way to address climate change,” she said.

Aurora has recently been making strides towards being more sustainable in other ways too. For example, Lindburg’s position was created this year, and since her hire the city has started looking into energy stretch code adoption and has placed a temporary moratorium on data centers, partially citing environmental reasons.

Her new division, she said in the YouTube video from September, is working within the city’s existing economic development department to create jobs through sustainable actions.

City staff are also in the early stages of developing loan programs to support sustainable upgrades for commercial and residential properties.

Sustainability, particularly through green building, was a large part of Laesch’s campaign platform last year.

As a mayoral candidate, he told The Beacon-News that he would work to attract higher-paying jobs by “positioning Aurora for the green collar economy that’s coming,” at least in part by encouraging businesses that create innovative building materials to move to the city. Later, during his inauguration speech, Laesch said Aurora would be looking to partner with the local CEJA Workforce Hub to help train students for that coming “green collar economy.”",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2026-01-12 23:59:48.126500

A key pillar of the scheme was the mandatory inclusion of energy storage.
As a result, between 3 and 4 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) are expected to be installed.
Beyond utility-scale projects, Robles points to a broader reactivation across Mexico’s energy ecosystem.
Key figures from Mexico’s first clean energy tender","The Government of Mexico has confirmed that it will launch its second public tender for clean power generation and energy storage projects in January. Against this backdrop, renewable energy stakeholders are increasingly optimistic, buoyed by the results of the first round, which awarded 3.3 GW of renewable capacity and 1.2 GW of storage.

One of the most notable features of the initial process was its unprecedented speed. This was made possible by classifying the selected projects as strategic, allowing for clearly defined and significantly shortened timelines for permitting and construction.

“Permitting and grid interconnection processes that used to take two years were compressed into just two months. That gives a huge amount of certainty to financiers, developers and off-takers,” said Alejandro Robles, director of MRS Sustentables, in an interview with Energía Estratégica.

Building on this precedent, Robles expects stronger private-sector participation in the upcoming round. “This second phase will be very interesting. Some major players preferred to wait and see how the first one unfolded, and now they will step in. If improvements are introduced, it could be even more powerful,” he noted.

The companies behind Mexico’s award of 3.3 GW of renewables and 1.2 GW of battery storage

However, he stressed that consolidating the scheme and expanding its impact will require greater flexibility in technical, economic and regulatory aspects.

“It would be highly beneficial to have more flexibility in the tenders, especially regarding where projects can interconnect to the grid. For example, authorities could say: ‘We need power in the western region’, and also provide an estimated cost for macro-level grid reinforcements. That allows developers to optimise their projects and assess viability from the outset,” he explained. According to Robles, the absence of such information constrains efficient planning and limits the entry of new market participants.

“This is a dynamic process. It is a new law and, in many ways, a new sector. We are all learning as we go, and regulatory instruments need to reflect that by gradually incorporating flexibility,” he added. He also suggested allowing developers to propose technologies other than those initially specified for certain regions, provided they are technically and economically justified.

Robles was keen to clarify that these requests do not imply lowering standards. On the contrary, he argues that the first tender acted as a strong market filter, raising overall project quality.

“Only serious projects make it through. You need secured land leases, advanced grid interconnection studies, environmental and social impact assessments already filed, and the financial capacity to assume grid reinforcements that can cost hundreds of millions of pesos,” he said.

A key pillar of the scheme was the mandatory inclusion of energy storage. All awarded projects were required to integrate battery systems equivalent to 30% of nominal capacity, with three hours of backup for solar PV and four hours for wind power. As a result, between 3 and 4 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) are expected to be installed.

“Energy storage is no longer optional. It has arrived, it will be deployed, and it will become part of the backbone of Mexico’s power system,” Robles stated.

Beyond utility-scale projects, Robles points to a broader reactivation across Mexico’s energy ecosystem. Demand for distributed generation has risen, particularly among industrial consumers, with a surge in projects below 20 MW.

At the same time, equipment suppliers, engineering firms, financial advisors and operations and maintenance (O&M) providers have begun to mobilise. “This is activating the entire ecosystem. It will create well-paid jobs and generate business opportunities for suppliers, technicians and recruiters,” he said.

Despite the positive signals, Robles acknowledged that several regulatory components remain unfinished. While the new Electricity Sector Law was published in March and its implementing regulation unveiled in October, key elements such as grid interconnection manuals, market rules and technical standards still need updating.

“Not everyone has the full picture yet. But overall, the signals from the authorities have been very positive,” he concluded.

In 2025, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) supported communities recovering from Hurricane Helene, took actions to address PFAS contamination and continued to protect the state’s natural resources for the health and prosperity of all North Carolinians.

The monumental task of helping communities recover from Hurricane Helene, while rebuilding in a way that makes them more resilient to future storms, played a central role in the Department’s actions last year. In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 12 months on helping North Carolinians recover from the hurricane.

2025 By the Numbers

Aiding recovery, resiliency in WNC

In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 18 months on helping North Carolinians recover from Helene:

Awarded $365 million in grants for water infrastructure repairs and resiliency.

Mapped 4,000 landslides, helping North Carolinians stay safe from future slides.

Inspected 400 dams.

Awarded $12 million to clean up debris in streams and rivers.

Designated 177 debris collection sites.

In 2025, DEQ received the first federal funding through EPA to improve flood resiliency to drinking water, wastewater and septic systems affected by Hurricane Helene. The Division of Water Infrastructure received $685 million in supplemental funds and has completed two funding rounds using these funds to date.

The Dam Safety Program established the North Carolina Dam Safety Grant Fund in accordance with House Bill 1012 (SL2025-26), making $10 million in state funding available to dam owners for the rehabilitation and/or removal of Hurricane Helene damaged high-hazard dams.

In August, EPA awarded DEQ a $61 million grant for Hurricane Helene State Program Support for Hazardous Waste Management. The grant will run through Sept. 30, 2030, and will assist North Carolina with emergency response and recovery from Hurricane Helene. It also will fund preparations for emergency recovery as related to DEQ’s hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, recycling and materials management, emergency response programs and pesticide management.

DEQ created the Western NC Recovery Grants Program that provides free, customized grant writing support to local governments and partner nonprofits in Western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene. The program objective is to help impacted communities secure federal and state funding for long-term recovery projects.

NC Geological Survey staff mapped more than 2,600 landslides resulting from Hurricane Helene and responded to more than 400 landslides.

The NC General Assembly allocated emergency disaster recovery funding to DEQ’s Underground Storage Tank Section (UST) to assist owners and operators with testing and repairing tanks that store petroleum and hazardous substances and were damaged by Hurricane Helene. The program provides temporary financial assistance for emergency services until owners receive federal disaster relief funds or insurance reimbursements. Loans are interest-free and mature upon the earlier of receiving federal disaster relief or other funding, or by June 30, 2030. As of November, DEQ had received 11 loan agreements for more than $1.2 million.

DEQ received an EPA grant (with state matching funds) totaling more than $15.8 million to assess and cleanup spills of petroleum from USTs damage by Hurricane Helene. The grant will run through March 31, 2030, and can be extended an additional two years. The UST section has identified more than 15 sites that may be eligible for funding. Assessment or corrective action is underway at nine facilities. Evaluation of additional sites is ongoing.

The Division’s Solid Waste Section approved 177 sites for temporary management of debris from Hurricane Helene. The section also worked with regional officials and residents to manage the debris.

In the aftermath of Helene, the Asheville Regional Office assisted by the Winston Salem Regional Office conducted more than 400 dam safety inspections.

The State Energy Office (SEO) launched a $5 million Clean Energy Microgrid Initiative to deploy small solar-powered microgrid systems in areas that lost power due to Hurricane Helene. As of December, five microgrid sites had been selected and materials were being purchased.

DEQ received the first federal funding for onsite decentralized wastewater to support Hurricane Helene recovery. The $22.5 million EPA award is currently open for applications through the Division of Water Infrastructure until March 2, 2026, and funds the replacement and repair of septic systems in a 39-county region of WNC.

DEQ awarded a $10 million grant to MountainTrue, an Asheville based nonprofit, to clean up debris from 125 miles of streams. Funding from DEQ has allowed the organization to hire 79 workers, who removed an average 10,000 pounds of debris from Western NC waterways daily.

Investing in Communities and Building Resiliency

In 2025, the State Water Infrastructure Authority awarded more than $877 million in loans and grants to update and harden drinking water, wastewater and septic systems, limit chemical pollution (PFAS), replace lead pipes and assist towns damaged by Hurricane Helene while improving resiliency for future storms.

The NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint program awarded $25.2 million to projects in 16 counties to build more resilient communities and protect lives, property and livelihoods across North Carolina. The program, through partnerships with agencies such as the NC Land and Water Fund, NC Emergency Management and the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, funded more than 73 projects valued at more than $78 million in total. The total investment from the Blueprint program for these initiatives amounted to over $34.4 million, demonstrating a highly efficient use of state resources where program dollars are working twice as hard through leveraged funding.

In 2025, the Division of Mitigation Services (DMS), initiated 14 new mitigation projects that will permanently protect approximately 97 acres of wetlands along with nearly 20 miles of stream and 91 acres of riparian buffer. These projects represent an investment of approximately $59 million to restore and protect natural resources in North Carolina. DMS currently manages 206 active and ongoing mitigation projects.

In 2025, DMS received mitigation credit releases valuing more than $40 million. In addition, 29 projects were closed out resulting in:

16.2 miles of stream restored and protected

174.2 acres of wetland restored and protected

92.66 acres riparian buffer area restored and protected

20.92 acres of Nitrogen and Phosphorous nutrient offset

In 2025, DMS assisted 235 development projects by taking responsibility for 270 new mitigation requirements including:

58,206.6 stream credits

80.9 wetland credits

1,367,513.8 riparian (streambank) buffer credits (equivalent to 31.39 acres)

6,388.45 Nutrient Offset Nitrogen credits (equivalent to 2.8 acres)

3,514.7 Nutrient Offset Phosphorus credits (equivalent to 24 acres)

DMS and Ecosystem Planning and Restoration completed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for the existing and future conditions (after implementation of flood mitigation projects) of the Stoney Creek watershed. The Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program’s first pilot project, a stormwater wetland basin on the Wayne Community College campus in Goldsboro, was completed in December. Construction on a second natural infrastructure project in the Stoney Creek watershed should begin in early 2026.

The State Energy Office’s Weatherization Assistance Program completed work in 1,380 households, including repairing or replacing 543 heating units and weatherizing 838 homes.

SEO reached agreement with three weatherization agencies for a combined contract value of more than $33 million to begin delivery of weatherization services with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in four of the seven program regions.

The $208 million Energy Saver North Carolina program Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs launched Jan. 16, 2025, which includes the Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) rebates.

As of December, the program processed applications in 98 of the North Carolina’s 100 counties. Residents in Mecklenburg and Wake counties can apply beginning in January 2026.

2,600 North Carolinians completed an application.

Approximately $650,000 rebates paid.

An estimated 293,000 kilowatts annually saved.

Households participating in the program will realize an estimated annual average savings of $945.

SEO selected nine projects to receive $2.79 million in Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants. The projects will reduce energy usage and lower costs for local governments, state agencies and universities.

Seven subawardees were selected for nearly $20 million in funding to improve North Carolina’s electric grid: the City of Wilson, Duke Energy Carolinas, Fayetteville Public Works Commission, Four County Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), Surry Yadkin EMC, Tideland EMC and the City of Gastonia. The request for proposals for the next funding round of about $9.7 million will be released in 2026.

The Utility Savings Initiative saved $159 million in avoided utility costs in fiscal 2024–25 and a cumulative $2.26 billion in avoided costs since fiscal 2002–03 by using efficiency improvements across state facilities.

The Division of Air Quality (DAQ) awarded $1.91 million for new public electric vehicle chargers across North Carolina, filling gaps in the state’s charging network along highways and in rural communities. The projects will prevent more than 657 tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere and will avoid 125 pounds of nitrogen oxide emissions and 1,191 pounds of volatile organic compound emissions.

DAQ awarded $1.14 million in grants for clean vehicle projects, including more than $270,000 for new all-electric vehicles. These awards are projected to eliminate 3,483 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 57 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 7,700 pounds of fine particle emissions.

The Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) received $26 million in EPA funding in October for grants to local communities in western North Carolina to improve recycling operations damaged by Hurricane Helene and to conduct recycling and waste management workshops for disaster preparedness.

DEACS awarded $1.17 million (plus $1.11 million in matching funds) in recycling grant funding to 19 businesses and 15 local governments for projects that are expected to create 31 jobs and divert 25,000 tons of material from landfills annually.

DCM’s Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP) awarded $6 million to 32 communities across coastal North Carolina. A total of $1.9 million was allocated to cover technical assistance in risk assessment and resilience planning, as well as incorporating resiliency into Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) Land Use Plans. Grants totaling more than $4 million were awarded to communities to support engineering, design and construction.

DCM’s Public Beach and Coastal Waterfront Access Program awarded more than $2.25 million in grants to support 10 projects that will expand and improve public access to North Carolina’s beaches and coastal waterways. The next round of funding for this program will be announced in January 2026.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service awarded a $1 million coastal wetlands grant to DCM for the purchase of The South End at Topsail Beach. This is the final portion of the total $8 million that was required for the conservation of this ecologically rich barrier island property. The South End consists of more than 100 biodiverse acres of salt marsh, maritime forest, dune and beach on a dynamic ocean inlet. The NC Coastal Land Trust will execute the purchase and transfer the property to DCM, which will maintain it as a public access area in cooperation with the town of Topsail Beach.

DCM received $227,833 in funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program, which provides funding to marinas and other boating facilities for outdoor recreation. The funding will allow staff to training opportunities.

The Division of Water Resources awarded more than $2.6 million in grants to support stream restoration, water-based recreation and water management projects across North Carolina. The total includes nearly $2.3 million awarded through two different grant cycles of the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects fund, and $350,880 to support two stream restoration projects on agricultural lands through a cost-sharing program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

DWR awarded more than $9.39 million for five projects in coastal North Carolina for beach and dune renourishment. There were five projects that received funding from the Coastal Storm Damage Mitigation Fund, which is funded by the N.C. General Assembly through Session Law 2023-134 for costs associated with beach nourishment, artificial dunes and other projects to mitigate or remediate coastal storm damage to the ocean beaches and dune systems of the state.

DWR awarded more than $5.8 million in grants in funding from the Flood Resiliency Blueprint to support projects that provide flood reduction or flood resiliency benefits across the following six river basins across North Carolina: Cape Fear, French Broad, Lumber, Neuse, Tar Pamlico & White Oak basins. The grants were awarded to 10 local governments through a one-time appropriation of flood resiliency funding received through the NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint administered through the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects program.

The State Resilience Office (SRO) joined DEQ in July to support resilience-building statewide. The SRO, previously at the N.C. Department of Public Safety, supports local governments and their partners to plan for and invest in resilience initiatives. The SRO also manages the NC Resilience Exchange, an online toolbox of resilience resources and staffs the Interagency Resilience Team, a partnership of state agencies working to promote resilience efforts across state government.

SRO, in partnership with the State Climate Office, kicked off its second Planning for Extreme Heat Cohort Program. Nine local governments from the coast to the mountains participated in the program with the goal of developing a local heat action plan. Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related impact.

In January, SRO published the NC Resilient Communities Planning Guide to help local leaders, especially local governments, plan for a more resilient future in their communities. This two-volume tool guides users through the process of understanding their vulnerabilities and developing a project plan to address them.

The Blueprint Tool, posted in April, serves as a resource for communities, local governments and partners by providing accurate, data-driven flood-risk and vulnerability assessments.

The Blueprint released its first progress report in March.

The NCGS brought in record external funding this year with 11 grant projects totaling more than $2 million. The projects cover an array of topics from foundational geologic mapping needs to critical minerals and rare earth element studies to data preservation.

Protecting North Carolinians from Forever Chemicals

DEQ continues to lead on addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in North Carolina, guided by the Action Strategy for PFAS. DEQ continues to work on limiting PFAS discharges to the environment, protecting public health and addressing remediation efforts to clean up existing PFAS contamination. The Division of Waste Management (DWM) continues to direct Chemours Co. Fayetteville Works plant to sample private wells and provide alternate water as warranted based on results. DEQ has also required Chemours to expand sampling to an area that now encompasses 10 counties.

The Bernard Allen Memorial Emergency Drinking Water Fund, administered by DWM, continues to notify persons whose private wells are at risk of PFAS contamination, test private wells for PFAS and provide alternate drinking water to owners of wells contaminated by PFAS. The program sampled 414 private wells for PFAS and provided drinking water to 113 residences in the past fiscal year. Requests for sampling of private wells continue to increase.

DEQ required Chemours to expand welltesting (Opens in new window) in the lower Cape Fear region under its consent order, expanding eligibility to 14,000 additional residences.

The Environmental Management Commission adopted groundwater standards for three types of PFAS: PFOS, PFOA and GenX.

DWM’s Solid Water Section has required all permitted sanitary landfills to sample their facilities’ groundwater monitoring networks for PFAS and has directed facilities to update receptor surveys and sample private wells and provide alternate water when applicable. The majority of DWM programs are directing drycleaning facilities, pre-regulatory landfills, permitted hazardous waste facilities and inactive hazardous facilities to evaluate PFAS effects and where applicable direct these facilities to complete updated private-well receptor surveys and provide alternate water where applicable.

DEQ’s Division of Water Resources worked with Sampson County Disposal LLC to develop a special order of consent that requires SCD to begin testing groundwater and water runoff from the Sampson County Landfill for PFAS and to install an advanced groundwater treatment system. Sampson County Landfill is the first landfill with a proposed direct discharge that will install an advanced treatment system designed for PFAS removal.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section staff coordinated with DWI to hire a contractor to develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan that has been submitted to EPA for approval. The plan will allow Federal Emerging Contaminants Small and Disadvantaged Community Grant funds to be used by DWM and the PWS Section to collect hundreds of samples to test for PFAS in drinking water and provide technical assistance to affected communities.

DWR’s Groundwater Resources Branch completed its initial round of statewide groundwater PFAS sampling of a statewide network of groundwater monitoring wells. DWR has incorporated additional follow-up PFAS sampling into the branch's routine sampling process.

DWR, at the request of the Environmental Management Commission, developed proposed rules that would establish industrial users discharging wastewater at publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities (POTWs) and direct dischargers to perform for one year baseline monitoring for three PFAS compounds: PFOS, PFOA and GenX. Dischargers that have results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the PFAS compounds. POTWs will submit to DWR annual reports on the activities of significant industrial users. Industries will continue water sampling and following plans until the three PFAS compounds cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

At the request of the Environmental Management Commission, DWR developed proposed rules to minimize 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA has identified as a likely carcinogen. The rules would require large industrial users discharging wastewater for treatment at POTWs and direct dischargers that likely have 1,4-dioxane in their wastewater perform baseline monitoring for the compound for one year. Dischargers showing sampling results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate 1,4-dioxane. Industrial practices will be summarized, and POTWs will submit annual reports to DWR. Industries will continue water sampling until the compound cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

Additional accomplishments

DAQ released an update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a continued trend of declining air pollution emissions and improved air quality. In August, North Carolina celebrated being in compliance with every federal health-based air quality standard for 10 consecutive years, which benefits public health and the economy. Among the 20 most populous states in the U.S., North Carolina has the longest running streak of being in statewide attainment with the standards.

For the second time in its history, DAQ recorded no exceedances of the ozone air quality standard during the year.

DAQ upgraded the Air Quality Portal’s public mapping tool, the Ambient Information Reporter. Improvements include a new Air Quality Index layer, measuring fine particulate data and a better display of surface visibility data.

DWM’s Brownfields Redevelopment Section celebrated the 750th Brownfields Agreement at a site known as Brown School, which has been transformed into an affordable housing community called the Brown School Lofts at Legacy Heights.

DEQ’s environmental education program hosted 30 livestreamed talks with top researchers and educators in partnership with the NC Museum of Natural Sciences that reached more than 7,000 viewers this year. The talks are broadcast on YouTube and shared with schools, universities and colleges, state agencies and the public.

In 2025, 46 educators achieved the NC Environmental Education Certification, a nationally recognized professional credential managed by the DEQ in partnership with various state agencies. The program saw strong growth with 92 new enrollments, with both classroom teachers and nonformal educators pursuing their certification. To earn the certification, participants must commit to 200 hours of professional development, community leadership and instruction.

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program team submitted to EPA its Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which details 14 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and presents ways to reduce statewide emissions by 50% by 2030 from the 2005 baseline, and attain net-zero by 2050.

The Department submitted an updated NC Energy Security Plan to the Department of Energy that included new sections on critical infrastructure and cross-sector dependencies, emergency preparedness and response, energy sector threats and impacts, a risk assessment, and risk mitigation and coordination.

The NC Geological Survey digitized about 500 geophysical well logs and created an online viewing tool, allowing for easier and deeper analyses without specialized software.

The NC Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) Study and Evaluation Tool was completed in association with Applied Weather Associates in May. The PMP replaces outdated values provided in hydrometeorological reports. The study relies on the most current practices for defining PMP, including comprehensive storm analyses procedures, extensive use of geographical information systems, explicit quantification of topography and coastal effects, updated maximum dew point and sea surface temperature climatology for storm adjustments, and improved understanding of weather and climate related to extreme rainfall in the region.

Nearly 40 experts attended two workshops held by the Coastal Reserves program to develop habitat resilience plans for the Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island reserves. Attendees addressed habitat vulnerability and risk, research, monitoring and solutions. The Masonboro Island Reserve workshop yielded a list of 41 research and monitoring needs to foster future resilience at the site. Products from the Zeke's island Reserve workshop are under development.

DCM’s Local Permit Officer Program held a two-day workshop in May for 60-plus officers in central and southern sites and in October for Northern/Northeastern officers. The workshops included field trips to Manteo and Swansboro and included presentations by Division staff and other state and federal agencies representatives, rule updates, hands-on training in the field and dialogue/discussions with questions and answer sessions.

DCM celebrated the 40th anniversary of the state’s National Estuarine Research Reserve, designated by the state and NOAA to protect special places in the state, including the Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island Reserves. This designation inspired the state to later create the umbrella N.C. Coastal Reserve, which is authorized by the N.C. Coastal Area Management Act.

Across all reserve sites, the total value of DEQ’s volunteer program was $38,374.13. (1,340.75 reported volunteer hours valued at $33.01/hour.) 500-plus pounds of marine debris removed by volunteers.

DMF, in cooperation with the NC Department of Information Technology and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, put into effect Dec. 1 new harvest reporting requirements for recreational and commercial fishermen.

DMF’s Observer Program launched in February the automated Observer Trip Scheduling System, which schedules observer trips for Estuarine Gill Net Permit holders. The Division worked with the N.C. Department of Information Technology and volunteer commercial fishermen to develop the system, which is a requirement of North Carolina’s Endangered Species Act Section 10 Incidental Take Permit.

DMF completed and implemented four fishery management plans — for Spotted Seatrout, Eastern Oyster, Hard Clam and Southern Flounder — that were adopted by the N.C. Marine Fisheries Commission.

The Artificial Reef Program finalized its five-year timeline for ocean reef enhancements, funded by Coastal Recreational Fishing License revenue. The Artificial Reef Program plans to complete one project per year, for a total of five projects, one in each coastal region.

The Utility Scale Solar Decommissioning Program rules went live Aug. 1 and allows project owners to create an online account to register utility-scale solar projects, upload decommissioning plans and financial assurance mechanism documents, pay registration fees and update project.

DWR protects water quality in North Carolina by processing permits, certifications and conducting inspections for facilities that discharge wastewater. DWR staff responded to resident complaints and investigated wetland and streambank vegetation to ensure compliance with state law. Regional staff:

Inspected 707 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted facilities, 100 sanitary sewer collection systems, 583 non-discharge wastewater treatment facilities and 1,872 animal feeding operations.

Responded to 1,609 individual incidents and complaints.

Completed 1,025 stream determinations and 967 wetland/buffer inspections and investigations.

Performed, with support from the Public Water Supply Section, approximately 5,400 site visits, including 1,835 sanitary surveys.

DWR’s 401 water quality certification program, which assesses and regulates water quality construction damage to streams, streambanks and wetlands, issued 2,534 certifications. The program’s average processing time for the certifications was 29 days, less than half the program’s goal of 60 days.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section Plan Review Unit reviewed 93% of 1,553 drinking water infrastructure engineering projects as of Dec. 12 for compliance with public water system state rules.

DWR launched a tool to display the results of freshwater sampling conducted through the WNC Recreational Water Quality Monitoring program to help the public identify locations where E. coli levels are above or below recreational guidance values in three river basins.

Between Nov. 24, 2024, and Oct. 25, 2025, DWR’s Water Sciences Section laboratories reported 150,769 compound results.

As of Nov. 20, DWR’s Algae Lab resolved 332 reports received on the Fish Kill & Algal Bloom Dashboard, an interactive tracking tool.

DWR completed 2,847 water quality sampling visits through the Ambient Monitoring System, and 351 visits through the Random Ambient Monitoring System. These two programs provide key data to track water quality across the state.

The Senate voted 80 to 13 Monday evening to advance the package, which passed the House last week by an overwhelming margin of 397-28. The package covers funding for the departments of Commerce, Justice and Interior; sciences and related agencies; and energy and water projects.

A Senate-crafted bill to fund the some of the same departments stalled on the Senate floor last month after Colorado Sens. John Hickenlooper (D) and Michael Bennet (D) objected to it in protest of plans by White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder.

Monday’s vote sets up another vote on Tuesday to proceed to the spending package, which Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said he hopes to pass before the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.

Bennet told The Hill that his problem with the appropriations package, which includes funding for the National Science Foundation, the entity that sponsors and provides grants to NCAR, remains unresolved.

“Our issues have not been addressed,” he said.

Hickenlooper said he wants to add language to the package to ensure that the atmospheric research center gets to spend the money that Congress already appropriated for it.

“I haven’t budged,” he said. “Just spend the money that was appropriated for this fiscal year. I’m not asking for money.”

“Finish what we’ve done,” he said. “It’s not just in Colorado, people are frustrated by the cuts to all science. … This will be the first time in decades … where we’ve back-trenched. We’re not spending as much money as we spent last year on research. That’s what creates innovation, that’s what creates job startups, that’s what creates jobs.”

Thune, however, is unlikely to accept any changes to the bill, which would require it to be sent back to the House for approval before going to President Trump’s desk.

There appears to be more than enough support for the package in the Senate to quash a filibuster and advance the bill to a vote on final passage.

Senators will spend the rest of the week moving through the various procedural hurdles needed to get it across the finish line.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) praised the “result of months of work [and] bipartisan and bicameral negotiations.”

She said it would reduce discretionary spending “while better focusing spending on the key priorities of the American people.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Appropriations panel, said the legislation would help Americans afford their electric bills, enjoy access to clean drinking water at home and prevent flooding in vulnerable areas around the country.

Congress needs to pass a total of nine regular appropriations bills to fund the government before a Jan. 30 deadline. Once the pending three-bill minibus passes, Congress will need to knock out six more appropriations bills.

Senate and House negotiators over the weekend reached a deal on another two-bill spending package to fund financial services, general government, national security, the Department of State and related programs.

But they have yet to find a path for passing two of the biggest spending bills before the end-of-January deadline: the Defense appropriations and those for the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Those two bills account for approximately two-thirds of the annual discretionary federal budget.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/thunejohn_011226gn02_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-12 22:59:39.969529

I must confess, I have to watch my lead foot.

I blame my father, who also had a lead foot and actually got a speeding ticket a few weeks before he died. When I was a teenager, he indulged me with a Pontiac Firebird as my first vehicle, complete with an old school hood-mounted radar detector.

What was he thinking? Seriously!

While I haven’t gotten a speeding ticket in many years (I’m older, if not wiser), it’s something I must always remain hypervigilant about, and for that reason I am a huge fan of adaptive cruise control, which helps keep my heavy-footed tendencies in check.

Electric vehicles and hybrids have no shortage of pep. So it’s really imperative that I keep an eye on the speedometer so I won't have those soul-crushing “disco lights” pop up in my rear-view mirror.

Which leads me to the Toyota Prius Nightshade plug-in hybrid edition, where I recently spent some quality time behind the wheel.

The special edition of the redesigned Prius features blacked-out accents like 19-inch wheels, badging, and trim, plus unique interior details like carbon fiber accents and black SofTex seats with grey stitching, all built on the XLE trim level.

Yes, it’s as striking as it sounds.

It retains the standard 2.0L hybrid powertrain (194 hp) with available all-wheel drive, offering excellent fuel economy (around 57 MPG combined) and a more aggressive, stylish look with exclusive colors like Karashi (a much-more-attractive-than-it-sounds mustard yellow).

The plug-in option allows owners to charge the small battery which provides 40 miles of pure electric range before switching to the gas engine. Plug-in vehicles are a great way to “try out” electric vehicles and often give their owners plenty of driving range for the daily commute.

Standard features include an 8-inch touchscreen (with an available 12.3-inch upgrade), wireless charging and available heated/ventilated seats.

Sadly, it was a wet week in Detroit and my plans included a 215-mile round trip on a day where Mother Nature couldn’t make up her mind between rain, snow and pea soup fog.

While I would normally prefer to drive an AWD vehicle in such weather, the Prius (mine didn’t include the option) behaved quite well in the inclement weather.

The vehicle I tested had a lot of luxury bells and whistles like the heated steering wheel. I found the standard touchscreen to be adequately sized. The wireless charger is a slot next to the cup holders and unfortunately it was inconsistent in charging, which was frustrating.

There is a useful hidden compartment in front of the cupholders where you can stow something you want to be out of sight, like some pocket change or your phone.

It’s a hatchback and the seats fold flat in the back seat, with ample cargo space. There’s a huge sunroof with a divider in between the front and back seats.

It’s definitely a lot of vehicle for the money, which as tested totaled $41,304. It felt like it should be at least $10,000 or $15,000 more than that.

I first drove the new Prius in fall 2023 during a much longer road trip — 1,100 miles across four states in three days. The then all-new Prius garnered a lot of admiring glances, as did the Nightshade edition.

In Texas, we pride ourselves on being builders of the American economy. We build more, build bigger and build faster than almost every other state. Affordable energy is foundational to that advantage.

That track record of innovation and know-how is why Texas should take the lead in reviving an American-made solar industry — one that further disentangles us from China.

Texas is widely known as an oil and gas powerhouse. But we are far more than that. Today, Texas is the second-largest producer of solar power in the nation, and growth is accelerating rapidly. Solar now accounts for nearly 10% of our state’s electricity generation.

The success Texas has seen in building solar power facilities is a source of pride. But it is not nearly enough to compete with China across the full supply chain.

The real vulnerability lies upstream. The global solar supply chain remains dominated by China — from polysilicon to wafers to the technical expertise required to assemble final modules. For an industry that will shape America’s economic and energy future, that dependence represents a serious strategic risk.

Leaders across the political spectrum agree the United States must rebuild its manufacturing base and reduce reliance on geopolitical rivals. We are already making progress in other parts of the energy value chain, including critical minerals and nuclear power. Investing in domestic solar manufacturing is another clear opportunity.

In recent years, companies have stepped up their commitment to building an America-first solar supply chain, and much of that momentum is happening in Texas.

Since 2022, U.S. solar manufacturing investments have totaled $36.6 billion. As of 2024, Texas was home to at least 10 planned solar panel manufacturers, along with nine facilities producing other solar components.

Texas continues to lead. Last year, SEG Solar completed its first utility-scale delivery from its new Houston manufacturing plant.

In Wilmer, T1 Energy has Americanized a solar factory it acquired from a Chinese firm. Beyond restoring American ownership, the company is prioritizing American-made materials — shifting away from imported aluminum frames in favor of U.S.-made steel and partnering with Corning to supply domestically produced solar wafers from Michigan. Last month, T1 Energy also began construction on a new solar cell fabrication plant just outside Austin, investing more than $400 million in the project.

This is what a genuine American solar renaissance looks like: factories coming online, jobs reshored to U.S. soil, and real production capacity returning home.

Rebuilding domestic solar manufacturing takes time. Assets must be acquired, facilities modernized and supply chains reassembled. But Texas is already proving this can be done, and we should accelerate the effort.

Yet even as this renaissance unfolds, some policymakers and advocates argue we should pull the rug out from under the solar industry, relying on debunked talking points that undermine real progress.

The more productive question — and one Texans should unite around — is how to accelerate reshoring and ensure America controls the materials and expertise behind one of the world’s fastest-growing industries.

Voters already understand this. More than 70% of Americans, including 60% of Republicans, view renewable energy favorably. They want cleaner power and the economic benefits that come with it. In Texas alone, the current fleet of utility-scale wind, solar and energy storage projects is estimated to generate $12.3 billion in new local tax revenue.

Imagine how much stronger that economic story could be — more jobs, more tax revenue and lower energy prices — if Texas made a meaningful commitment to reshoring the solar industry.

Texas has the workforce, the infrastructure and the record of execution to lead. If we commit to building the full solar supply chain, we can keep America competitive, strengthen our energy security and ensure the future of solar is made at home.

An example of this is New York’s ongoing energy crisis.
Recently codified in the 2025 New York State Energy Plan, this is a victory for common-sense practicality over inflexible ideology.
It has progressed to an inflection point where we need to ask ourselves if we should reduce emissions or keep the lights and furnaces on across New York State.
Our state’s lack of energy is compounded with other issues that deepen the affordability crisis felt by every New Yorker.","Issues that dominated throughout 2025 have no sign of slowing down. In 2026, energy, regulations and housing will continue to be issues that rise to the top of every conversation. These issues are inextricably linked and combine to create an affordability crisis that is only slated to get worse without intervention.

Steps are being taken to address these, but there is still much work to be done to create the future New Yorkers need and deserve. This November’s upcoming election will only deepen the challenges we face in our state. Many elected officials who agree with common-sense policies are not inclined to agree loudly and publicly, due to the significant pressure placed on them by small but passionate advocacy groups. This is creating policy misalignments, prioritizing what will please the loudest voices that are making headlines over the needs of all New Yorkers.

An example of this is New York’s ongoing energy crisis. We applaud Governor Kathy Hochul’s ‘all-of-the-above’ approach to energy generation, utilizing natural gas, renewables, hydroelectric and more. Recently codified in the 2025 New York State Energy Plan, this is a victory for common-sense practicality over inflexible ideology. It has become clear that the policies and attached timelines previously put in place have had a significant detrimental impact on our economy without creating meaningful change for the environment. It has progressed to an inflection point where we need to ask ourselves if we should reduce emissions or keep the lights and furnaces on across New York State.

Our state’s lack of energy is compounded with other issues that deepen the affordability crisis felt by every New Yorker. Housing has been identified as a key priority for NYS to address, but the policies in place are limiting stock and working against our goals. In our region alone, hundreds of units of housing cannot get off the ground due to a lack of power. A builder in our region recently stated that our hot real estate market is not caused by an influx of population, but rather by a regulatory environment that limits supply by disincentivizing developers from building single-family homes. This limited stock, in combination with escalation clauses, all-cash deals, waived inspections and more, is pricing working-class families out of the market. Without intervention, real estate experts expect this crisis to get worse over the next decade, with affordability concerns growing and people not having a place to call home.

Housing is far from the only issue negatively impacted by New York’s regulatory environment. Last year, Greater Rochester Chamber worked with the Business Council of New York State, New York State Economic Development Council and other partners to create the Blueprint for New York – a study that compiles and analyzes the regulatory issues across New York State that impact economic and community growth. For years, New York has been listed as one of the 3 to 5 worst states to do business in. The Blueprint provides Legislators with an opportunity to correct that and is a roadmap that was created with the voices of leaders from all corners of our state. Instead of blaming the current Governor and legislature for these issues, which have persisted for decades, it provides a pathway to cement their legacies by correcting the economic and job inhibitors that plague our state.

The process of creating this Blueprint also provides an important example that we should seek to follow to make smarter, more beneficial policies. I hope for and encourage decision makers in Albany to go out, travel our state, listen to businesses, non-for-profits, consumers and all relevant stakeholders to develop a comprehensive understanding of the issues facing our state before creating policies and legislation solely based on the loudest voices in the room.

2026 can be a transformational session for our region and state – a session that shifts the trajectory and momentum of our state. But it can only be so if we all play a role in helping to achieve these goals. Leaving out key constituencies from the process of policymaking is a recipe for disaster. CLCPA regulations and bail reform are just two examples of policies that could have received widespread support and results if all sides were included in the final decisions.

It is important to encourage our elected officials who are wary to break political party lines for fear of retribution. Our Rochester delegation has been terrific for our community – they have shown up for us, supported us and fought tirelessly for our region. Now, it is our turn to show up for them and support them in making the decisions that just make sense. Being vocal about your needs and goals is critical to ensuring that there is political support for them – especially if you never have before. This November, when you go to the polls, remember who supports you and your goals and needs and show up to vote for those people.

New York has the opportunity to be the best state. We have everything going for us, but we need to address the issues that are causing people and businesses to flee. I love living in New York. I challenge decision makers to enact policy for those like me – people who love it here, want to stay and want to come here. Including all voices instead of the loudest voices is critical to the future of our state. In 2026, let’s bring all voices to the table to enact sound policies that support families and businesses.

Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

The automaker has brought a 204-kilowatt rooftop solar system online atop a new expansion at its Lafayette factory. The system went into service in August 2025 and is now generating electricity for Subaru’s operations.

Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA) is the company’s only vehicle assembly plant outside Japan. It builds the gas-powered Ascent, Crosstrek, and Forester models for the North American market. Subaru’s all-electric Solterra is built in Japan.

The new solar array generates more than three times the electricity currently consumed by the plant’s expansion. That means it produces a net surplus of clean energy, which Subaru uses elsewhere at the plant, helping cut energy costs while shrinking its carbon footprint.

Subaru estimates the system will offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, roughly equivalent to the annual electricity use of 43 homes. Over its expected 30-year lifespan, the rooftop solar installation is expected to generate millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity.

The project builds on SIA’s ongoing sustainability efforts. The Lafayette plant was the first auto assembly facility in the US to achieve zero-landfill status, and Subaru says it consistently invests in technologies aimed at reducing waste, conserving resources, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

Subaru partnered with Emergent Solar Energy to design and build the system. West Lafayette-based Emergent specializes in turnkey solar and energy storage projects for manufacturers and agricultural operations throughout the state.

Paloma Greenwald, Health and Climate Programs Manager at Elders Action Network, can speak to the health impacts of extreme weather

The report’s findings include:

Utility Bills Spiked: Far from fulfilling his promise to cut energy costs in half in his first year, Trump’s policies have led to household electric bills surging by 13%; residential gas prices have increased nearly 60%, directly contributing to utility companies raising rates by at least $85.8 billion on American families.

Jobs Are Down, Prices Are Up: Trump’s policies have destroyed more than 165,000 clean energy jobs, canceled enough renewable projects to power 13 million homes, and imposed tariffs that cost the average American household $1,100 in 2025 – compounding families’ financial burden.

Trump Worsened The Home Insurance Crisis: President Trump, whose cost-raising agenda is worsening the insurance affordability crisis, has received more than $3.7 million in campaign contributions from the industry, and tariffs are expected to increase home insurance costs 38% faster by the end of 2025, with tariffs on construction materials alone increasing premiums in some states by more than $400 per year.

Trump Protected Polluters: Trump gutted 31 pollution protections, forfeiting $275 billion in annual savings and up to 30,000 preventable deaths per year. In tandem, he played dangerous politics with disaster aid, raising the risks and recovery costs for communities facing extreme weather.

Trump Gutted Disaster Preparedness And Response: Trump has gutted our federal disaster response and canceled funding for states to prepare for disasters – putting Americans at risk and pushing the financial burden of recovery onto states and local communities. Trump’s cuts have also made weather forecasting more difficult, degrading storm forecasts and threatening life-saving weather alerts.",https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/category-img.png,N,,2026-01-13 00:58:18.293946

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.
The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours.
A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.
Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.","A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.

The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration's action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,"" Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — ""rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.

The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”

Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.

Trump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.

Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”

The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.

“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2026/01/PRIUS.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-13 02:58:38.251794

DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) – General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration’s push to loosen fuel-economy rules has affected the automaker’s business even more than its fast-changing trade policies.

Speaking at ‍an Automotive Press Association event ahead of this week’s Detroit auto show, Barra said the administration’s regulatory shifts, such as killing a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit and moving to roll back tailpipe-emissions rules, prompted GM to rapidly adapt its product plans.

“We had to make some fairly significant changes,” Barra said, referring to decisions to cut billions of dollars’ worth of EV ‌investments while leaning in harder to combustion-engine vehicles.

U.S. President Donald ‌Trump has championed slashing fuel economy regulations that guided the industry for years, in a push to make it easier to sell gasoline-powered cars. He also cut a $7,500 consumer tax credit on electric models in late September, causing demand to plummet.

Barra said GM still believes ​EVs eventually will take off in the U.S. as charging becomes easier and prices come down, and said GM still sees battery-powered vehicles as “the end game.”

“It ‍will take longer without the incentives, but I ​still think we’ll get there over time,” Barra said of the ​transition to being fully electric.

She reiterated that GM is developing plug-in hybrid vehicles, which ‍can run on fully electric power before the car switches to an internal combustion engine, and that the company is evaluating traditional hybrids as well. But she said GM will continue to focus more on EVs because they are a superior product for customers.

Several major automakers have pulled back from their EV ambitions, including ‍GM’s crosstown rival Ford Motor, which last month took a $19.5 billion writedown as it axed several EV programs.

GM this month said it would record a $6 billion charge to unwind ‍some electric-vehicle investments, following a $1.6 ‍billion third-quarter charge.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are ​really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what ​will ⁠be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, adding that she wants GM to ‌maintain flexibility to adjust to how regulations may shift in future administrations.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year proposed significantly reducing the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.
The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

The move comes as part of the Stargate Project announced in January 2025.

This direct capital infusion is designed to accelerate the expansion of data centre and energy infrastructure to meet surging demand for advanced AI computing power—a sector increasingly seen as foundational to future economic growth.

The investment builds upon a much broader, previously pledged $500bn commitment made public at the White House earlier this year.

OpenAI has selected SB Energy to construct and manage its 1.2GW data centre in Milam County, Texas, which was previously announced.

The site will serve as a central component of OpenAI’s infrastructure expansion plans.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.

Construction on these initial sites has commenced, with service dates expected from 2026 onwards.

The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

This model integrates OpenAI’s design specifications for first-party data centres with SB Energy’s experience in project execution and integrated energy supply to establish scalable infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale AI operations.

OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman said: “Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data centre infrastructure, and energy development and OpenAI’s deep domain expertise in data centre engineering.

“The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimised AI data centres.”

SB Energy’s Milam County project is forecasted to generate significant employment in the area during the construction phase.

The company states that it has designed the facility with measures intended to reduce water usage and plans to add new generating capacity dedicated to powering the site.

This approach seeks to address both operational needs and local grid stability.

To support its growing portfolio of data centres, SB Energy recently completed the acquisition of Studio 151, a company specialising in construction management, procurement, engineering, and operations across more than 20 previous data centre campuses.

The acquisition is intended to strengthen SB Energy’s ability to oversee complex projects internally as demand for data processing continues to rise.

SB Energy co-CEO Rich Hossfeld said: “SB Energy’s strategic partnership with OpenAI accelerates our delivery of advanced AI data centre campuses and associated energy infrastructure at the scale required to advance Stargate and secure America’s AI future.”

Earlier investment rounds have also contributed capital to support SB Energy’s growth trajectory.

In 2025, Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds invested $800m in redeemable preferred equity, marking their third financing round with SB Energy since 2020.

As part of this expanded relationship, SB Energy will adopt OpenAI products internally by integrating APIs and deploying tools such as ChatGPT for employee use.",https://www.techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2026/01/OpenAI-13a4c489f208695c4d8abfcda9441a75.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 23:58:48.953068

As Colorado Public Radio’s Sam Brasch reports, the mission of Richard Nixon’s Environmental Protection Agency has shifted under President Donald Trump to something decidedly other than its original purpose when established in 1970 after the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday it will reject Colorado’s latest plan to protect air quality over wilderness areas and national parks, citing the state’s attempt to shutter coal-fired power plants.

The disapproval marks the latest example of the Trump administration using its authority to buoy the state’s struggling coal industry. Over the last decade, utilities have agreed to shutter all six of Colorado’s coal-fired power plants by 2031 due to state-level climate laws and high costs associated with maintaining the aging facilities…

In an interview with CPR News, Cyrus Western, director of EPA Region 8, said the federal government determined the state could meet federal regional haze standards without shuttering the coal plants.

“We absolutely will have clean air,” Western said. “The state did not need to shut down these coal plants to be compliant.”

If you haven’t met EPA Region 8 Director and former Wyoming state Rep. Cyrus Western, who succeeded former Democratic Colorado Rep. KC Becker in the job, he’s a Central Casting Trump appointee–best known for an insanely racist Tweet about his state’s first African-American sheriff that somehow managed to not derail Mr. Western’s political career. The Colorado Sun’s Michael Booth reports that objections from…you guessed it, the conservative stronghold of Colorado Springs over the closure of a coal plant serving the city was the pretext for the EPA’s rejection of Colorado’s clean air plan:

The EPA on Friday said the state’s haze plan “did not properly consider and explain whether the nonconsensual closure of Colorado Springs Utilities’ Nixon Unit 1 power plant would be an act of taking private property without compensation.”

Cyrus Western, the EPA’s Region 8 administrator for Colorado and surrounding states, said in an interview Friday that Colorado Springs Utilities “has made it clear” they don’t want to close Nixon as scheduled.

It’s just the latest case of the Trump administration rolling back years of progress the state of Colorado has made on our own initiative to clean up our notoriously dirty air, but this one carries a particular stench due to the use of the Environmental Protection Agency to force major pollution sources to continue polluting–an outcome so far removed from the EPA’s original mission that it seems like a parody.

Paloma Greenwald, Health and Climate Programs Manager at Elders Action Network, can speak to the health impacts of extreme weather

The report’s findings include:

Utility Bills Spiked: Far from fulfilling his promise to cut energy costs in half in his first year, Trump’s policies have led to household electric bills surging by 13%; residential gas prices have increased nearly 60%, directly contributing to utility companies raising rates by at least $85.8 billion on American families.

Jobs Are Down, Prices Are Up: Trump’s policies have destroyed more than 165,000 clean energy jobs, canceled enough renewable projects to power 13 million homes, and imposed tariffs that cost the average American household $1,100 in 2025 – compounding families’ financial burden.

Trump Worsened The Home Insurance Crisis: President Trump, whose cost-raising agenda is worsening the insurance affordability crisis, has received more than $3.7 million in campaign contributions from the industry, and tariffs are expected to increase home insurance costs 38% faster by the end of 2025, with tariffs on construction materials alone increasing premiums in some states by more than $400 per year.

Trump Protected Polluters: Trump gutted 31 pollution protections, forfeiting $275 billion in annual savings and up to 30,000 preventable deaths per year. In tandem, he played dangerous politics with disaster aid, raising the risks and recovery costs for communities facing extreme weather.

Trump Gutted Disaster Preparedness And Response: Trump has gutted our federal disaster response and canceled funding for states to prepare for disasters – putting Americans at risk and pushing the financial burden of recovery onto states and local communities. Trump’s cuts have also made weather forecasting more difficult, degrading storm forecasts and threatening life-saving weather alerts.",https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/category-img.png,N,,2026-01-12 21:12:50.859498

Michigan Advance

Following the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to sign off on a set of contracts for DTE Energy to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center in Saline Township, Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of environmental and consumer advocacy groups have each filed a petition asking regulators to rehear the case.

During its Dec. 18 meeting, the public service commission granted DTE’s request for ex parte approval, allowing the contracts to move forward without intervention from outside organizations, which would be able to conduct legal discovery and file testimony on the contracts.

Ahead of the meeting, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and the coalition, made up of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, advocated heavily for a contested case on the matter, arguing that it would allow intervenors to ensure that DTE customers are protected from concerns like increased energy rates due to heavy energy demand from the facility.

While the Commission approved both contracts, that approval hinges on several conditions, including requirements for DTE to update its tariff structure for large-energy load customers, like data centers, and file an amended renewable energy plan to include a comparison of the resources it needs to meet the state’s requirement to provide 100% clean energy by 2040, both with and without the data center’s energy load.

The commission set a 30-day deadline for DTE to agree to the terms laid out in the Dec. 18 order.

In a statement released Friday, Nessel reiterated her disappointment in the commission’s decision to “fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” criticizing the heavy redactions of the publicly available copies of the contracts.

“This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect,” Nessel said.

Nessel’s petition for a rehearing challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts without a contested hearing. The petition also raises questions on how the conditions set by the commission would prevent DTE from passing along costs to serve the data center, which is under development by tech giant Oracle and data center developer Related Digital for use by ChatGPT-creator OpenAI.

Matt Helms, the commission’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the body looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for a rehearing, but denied any claims that they had not sufficiently reviewed the contracts.

The commission’s staff thoroughly reviewed unredacted contracts to ensure customers are protected, Helms said.

“The Commission’s order in this case recognizes the utility’s obligation to serve this customer under Michigan law while requiring the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country – protections that would not be available under existing tariffs without the Commission’s approval of these contracts,” Helms said.

Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan raised their own questions on how the conditions laid out by the commission would protect customers from increased energy rates, alongside other concerns, like how the conditions on the contracts will be enforced.

In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the contracts protect their customers from subsidizing the data center’s energy rate. The company will continue to follow the regulatory process, Lowry said.

DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration’s push to loosen fuel-economy rules has affected the automaker’s business ​even more than its fast-changing trade policies.

Speaking at an Automotive Press Association event ahead of ‌this week’s Detroit auto show, Barra said the administration’s regulatory shifts, such as killing a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit and moving ‌to roll back tailpipe-emissions rules, prompted GM to rapidly adapt its product plans.

“We had to make some fairly significant changes,” Barra said, referring to decisions to cut billions of dollars' worth of EV investments while leaning in harder to combustion-engine vehicles.

U.S. President Donald Trump has championed slashing fuel economy regulations that guided the ⁠industry for years, in a push ‌to make it easier to sell gasoline-powered cars. He also cut a $7,500 consumer tax credit on electric models in late September, causing demand to plummet.

Barra said ‍GM still believes EVs eventually will take off in the U.S. as charging becomes easier and prices come down, and said GM still sees battery-powered vehicles as “the end game.”

“It will take longer without the incentives, but I still ​think we’ll get there over time,” Barra said of the transition to being fully electric.

She ‌reiterated that GM is developing plug-in hybrid vehicles, which can run on fully electric power before the car switches to an internal combustion engine, and that the company is evaluating traditional hybrids as well. But she said GM will continue to focus more on EVs because they are a superior product for customers.

Several major automakers have pulled back from their EV ambitions, including GM’s crosstown rival Ford Motor, ⁠which last month took a $19.5 billion writedown as it ​axed several EV programs.

GM this month said it would record ​a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, following a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t ‍know what will be ⁠in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, adding that she wants GM to maintain flexibility to adjust to how regulations may shift in future administrations.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year proposed significantly reducing ⁠the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, ‌down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

Over the last 25 years, power companies have primarily built gas fired or renewable energy power plants, as opposed to coal fired power plants.","In 2025, the Trump administration threw its weight behind the coal industry.

“I call it beautiful clean coal,” Pres. Donald Trump said during an executive order signing on April 8, 2025. “I tell my people, never use the word coal unless you put ‘beautiful, clean’ before it. Right doc? So we call it beautiful clean coal. Beautiful clean coal.”

Trump promised to revive it from its decade plus decline, emphasizing its value as a source of power, energy security and jobs. In the spring, he signed an executive order called Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.

“We’ll streamline permitting, we will end the government bias against coal and we’re going to unlock the sweeping authorities of Defense Production Act – the Defense Production Act – to turbo charge coal mining in America. They made it impossible,” he said.

These moves were cheered on by many in Wyoming. The state produces the majority of the nation’s coal and depends on those revenues.

So, how did coal production fare in 2025?

Wyoming Public Radio’s Caitlin Tan spoke with University of Wyoming Economics Associate Professor Rob Godby. They talked at the end of 2025.

Editor’s Note: This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Cailin Tan: Rob, how did coal fare this year in 2025?

Rob Godby: This year in Wyoming, it'll be probably the second-worst year ever [in the modern mining age, which includes the Powder River Basin], after last year. It's not great by historical standards at all. We're about 60% below our height. That was about 15 years ago.

But you know, if you're looking for a little bit of an optimistic outlook, it's better than last year [2024].

We went into last year with a lot of coal sitting at coal fired power plants, so they didn't really get a big spring delivery schedule. It really dropped off in 2024, and that didn't happen in 2025.

But really, the bigger story was that natural gas prices were much higher in the last half of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, and so a lot more coal was used. Just broadly speaking, coal struggles when gas prices are lower.

But pessimists would have said, ‘Well, could it have been worse?’ I guess. And the answer is, unfortunately, yes. The long-term outlook for coal is that we just continue this secular decline over time. The curve might have flattened a little bit, in terms of the trend downward, but most analysts expect that that downward trend will continue, and really, it just comes down to cost.

It's just more expensive to run a coal fired power plant. Over the last 25 years, power companies have primarily built gas fired or renewable energy power plants, as opposed to coal fired power plants. In Wyoming, the last one was built in 2011, 2012, and that one is considered the only power plant in the country that can compete with renewable energy. It's right next to the cheapest source of coal in the country.

CT: Is that Dry Fork, near Gillette?

RB: Yeah. Dry Fork is the least cost plant in the country. The bottom line is, our energy system is evolving towards a renewable basis, with natural gas as the fossil fuel backup.

CT: Obviously, the Trump administration has made a lot of moves to try to, I guess, make coal less expensive of an industry...

RB: Yeah.

CT: …to try to deregulate. Could we see trickle effects from that over the next couple years, where it is more affordable to use coal? Or is it still just you're working against the age of power plants?

RB: That's the big problem, right? One of the things that the Trump administration has done is use these emergency orders to basically delay retirements of coal fired power plants. There's been a few power plants in the country where, literally, the operators want to shut them down, and then at the 11th hour, they've gotten this emergency order that says they can't do that.

The justification is usually some sort of grid integrity sort of argument, that we need that extra power. It is the case that demand has increased, and that does put a lot more stress on the power grid, but that has been a real challenge to keep these plants open that were getting ready to close, because they haven't seen a lot of investment in the last few years.

When you know a plant is close to retirement, it's kind of like an old car. You get to the point where you say, ‘I don't think it's worth it to put new tires on it, or to replace the brakes.’ You're just going to drive it until, really, it makes more sense to buy a brand new one.

The other big problem is the Trump administration will only be around until 2028, and then we don't know what happens after that. Given the fact that the alternatives to coal just keep getting cheaper and cheaper – natural gas, renewables, we're seeing new types of energy come onto the grid – all of those things make it more difficult to imagine a world 20 years from now that really needs coal to operate the way it does today.

The bottom line is that the Trump administration can kind of bend that curve with respect to the decline of coal, make it a little flatter. But at the end of the day, short of some major requirement to rebuild and to increase the number of coal fired power plants, the main source of demand for coal, which is power generation, [is] going to continue to decline, and as it declines, so will mining.

CT: This past fall, the Trump administration had scheduled a couple coal lease sales. They were the first in over a decade for our region. There was one in Montana and Wyoming. But the one in Montana got really low bids from companies themselves, and then the one in Wyoming was canceled shortly after.

RB: In Montana, they literally offered pennies per ton, not even pennies sometimes. Effectively, the price was, ‘Give us the coal for free, and we'll take the lease.’ That really kind of tells you what the value of coal is in the market right now. There's just really not a need for new sources of coal. There's enough existing coal out there to satisfy the demand in most cases for a long time yet.

There are a few situations where it might be beneficial to get a lease in a particular place, because it just helps you operationally. But altogether, the fact that they've had to cancel lease sales when this is such a pro coal administration tells you that even the White House can't offset markets. Markets are really the final determinant of whether coal is going to be around in the power generation market.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/79e13c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1440x756+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwpr%2Ffiles%2F201609%2FCoal.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 18:12:40.108898

It’s not that AI shouldn’t be used in civil infrastructure.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Lalitha Krishnamoorthy is vice president of AI and digital at Edmonton, Canada-based global engineering, architecture and environmental consultancy Stantec. Opinions are the author’s own.

America’s civil infrastructure is at a pivotal moment. While the rise of artificial intelligence has introduced new challenges, it also brings powerful tools and fresh opportunities to strengthen our systems. Recent surges in cyberattacks have highlighted vulnerabilities, but have also galvanized leaders to innovate and adapt, so our infrastructure remains robust and secure. AI-enabled attacks have made absolute protection impossible, meaning internal digital policies and governance are all the more critical to minimize system vulnerabilities.

American utility owners have long recognized the challenges of maintaining and modernizing the nation’s civil infrastructure systems. The highly exposed nature of electrical grids, water treatment facilities and gas lines make them prime targets for attacks. Over the last decade, there have been hundreds of reported incidents of cybercriminals and foreign actors hacking into some of America’s most vital infrastructure systems to wreak havoc and cause potential danger. Through August of 2024, cyberattacks on U.S. utilities surged by nearly 70% year over year.

AI has only proliferated more since then.

The advent of widespread, commercially available AI has created an entirely new headache for utility operators by dramatically lowering the technical savvy required to mount an attack. At the same time, utility operators now have access to advanced technologies that can both detect and defend against threats more effectively than ever before. So on one hand, hackers don’t need in-depth knowledge anymore — just a ChatGPT subscription and a Wi-Fi connection. On the other hand, it is now possible for teams to respond swiftly and intelligently to emerging risks due to AI-assisted programs democratizing security.

Updating legacy systems

Even the best protections and most advanced security systems can no longer defend against the scale of attack that AI enables. Deepfakes have proven quite capable of bypassing the knowledge-based authentication systems that banks and government agencies rely on, with the global financial sector reporting a 393% increase in deepfake-enabled phishing attacks in one year. If that’s their effort against top-tier security systems, then imagine the vulnerability of the legacy systems more often used by civil infrastructure.

This shift means security teams must move from trying to eliminate every spark to making sure that, if something does ignite, its impact is contained and recovery is swift.

Part of that is done through using properly installed firewalls and fail-safe systems. When bad actors inevitably do gain access to a system, these walls can close off their point of entry. Just because one system is exposed doesn’t mean the whole network of systems needs to go down with it.

Ironically, identifying a breach is where AI can actually help companies defend themselves. AI trained on the right usage data can leverage pattern recognition skills to detect anomalies and early warning signs of an attack. Odd or unusual user behavior, such as a user trying to access higher security information or making unusual changes to a system, can either alert IT teams or automatically isolate the affected area until security teams can assess the threat.

It’s a time-intensive, though worthwhile, security upgrade civil infrastructure teams can make. In the era of sensors and IoT systems, infrastructure’s digital footprint has expanded enormously — and with every expansion comes an increase of vulnerability. Having the ability to isolate each component is like having a gate valve on a leaking pipe; water can be shut off to the affected pipe before flooding causes even more damage.

AI governance and the role of employees

Even before an attack, improved governance and more diligent digital policies can limit the risk an organization faces. As much as limiting exposure for companies means creating internal firewalls and emergency shut-offs, it also means training and upskilling their workforce on data hygiene and AI use, including prompt engineering, detecting AI-generated phishing attempts and secure model deployment practices.

Having a workforce that understands what AI is (and what it isn’t) is vital to using AI correctly and safely. Adopting frameworks like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and conducting regular audits supports compliance and builds a culture of trust.

One of the most prominent threats organizations face as a result of AI isn’t a traditional attack per se, but rather an accidental data breach — one caused by lax policies and employee awareness. An analysis by the House Committee on Homeland Security estimated that 1 in 10 intrusions the U.S. faced in 2023 were due to improper access to credentials rather than any complex hack.

AI creates even greater potential for this sort of opportunistic breach as workers use large language models for their day-to-day tasks. Without clear policies governing AI use, the risk that sensitive data will be shared with a third-party source is significant. Workers may have little understanding of what’s happening with that data and how it could be used in the future to make the system more vulnerable. All it takes is the wrong data being pasted into a large language processor for highly sensitive information to become exposed.

Organizations need to focus on reducing damage and recovering more quickly when attacks occur. Figuring out how to integrate technologies such as voice recognition, deepfake detection and biometric recognition will be an essential part of creating safer infrastructure systems. Incorporating robust testing, continuous monitoring, and clear guidelines for responsible use will aid these technologies in enhancing security rather than introducing new vulnerabilities.

It’s not that AI shouldn’t be used in civil infrastructure. But understanding the risks to data privacy and the new vulnerabilities any new technology systems create is critical to understanding the risk. As crucial as updating legacy systems to modern standards is, minimizing the impact of human error when interacting with AI is equally vital.

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.

The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support — or lack of it — for Trump “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.

The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.

A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.

Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”

Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.

Trump said in an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, last fall that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.

Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”

The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.

“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://www.therepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/preview-3047.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:00:14.481750

A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

At Monday’s hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

This date marks ten years since the 2016 Lautenberg amendments, which imposed a 10-year limit on most TSCA confidentiality claims unless they are affirmatively renewed. As a result, EPA anticipates a continuous, rolling ""CBI sunset"" process that could affect several thousand submissions between mid-2026 and the end of 2027. See 91 Fed. Reg. 371 (Jan. 6, 2026).

Under the amended law, companies must reassert and resubstantiate their CBI claims before the 10-year deadline to maintain protection. Congress designed this requirement to ensure that only information that still genuinely warrants confidential treatment remains protected, and to prevent outdated or unnecessary secrecy. A likely outcome of this review process is that more chemical information previously protected as confidential will eventually become publicly available if claims are not renewed or cannot be justified.

EPA is developing new processes and information technology tools within its Central Data Exchange (CDX) system to manage the anticipated surge in resubstantiation requests. The agency plans to post public lists of TSCA submissions with expiring CBI claims on its TSCA CBI website and to provide at least 60 days' notice to affected companies, primarily through CDX notifications and related communications. EPA has acknowledged the operational challenges of compiling expiring claims, issuing notices, and reviewing extension requests, particularly in light of staffing losses and recent government shutdowns.

Nevertheless, to extend a CBI claim, companies must submit a substantiated extension request electronically through CDX no later than 30 days before the claim's expiration. These requests must include updated certifications and detailed justification demonstrating the continued need for confidentiality, consistent with TSCA and EPA's regulations. EPA will review each request and either grant or deny the extension, which may last for up to an additional 10 years. If a company fails to submit a timely and complete extension request, EPA is no longer required to protect the information from disclosure. In such cases, the previously confidential information may be made public without further notice to the submitter. Substantiation requirements are provided in 40 C.F.R. § 703.5(a) and (b). Rules identifying information not subject to either routine substantiation requirements or the 10-year expiration under TSCA section 14(e) can be found in 40 C.F.R. § 703.5(b)(5).

If EPA determines that a CBI claim should be denied and intends to disclose the information, it must provide the submitter with at least 30 days' advance notice. This notice affords the submitter a final opportunity to defend the confidentiality claim or submit additional substantiation before the information is made public. If this process does not resolve the issue, the claimant may pursue other remedies, including filing a complaint in federal court to prevent disclosure.

EPA is advising companies to begin preparing well in advance by reviewing TSCA submissions made on or after June 22, 2016, inventorying existing CBI claims, and assessing whether confidentiality is still necessary. Regulated entities should also ensure that their CDX accounts and contact information are current so they receive all required notices. Early preparation, familiarity with EPA guidance, and internal planning will be critical to managing the demands of the TSCA CBI sunset program and avoiding unintended public disclosure. The consequences of inaction are therefore significant, particularly for companies with multiple or high-value CBI claims.

He and Medved both volunteered in Jamaica in 2024 after Hurricane Beryl, but the damage was not as severe.
Chad Simon is a communications specialist at Sam Houston Electric Cooperative in Texas and accompanied the volunteers for a portion of the NRECA International trip to Jamaica in December.","John Medved of Rappahannock Electric Cooperative has helped restore power after natural disasters and brought electricity to remote communities throughout the world, but he has never faced anything as challenging as the destruction he found in Jamaica when he led a team of volunteer co-op lineworkers to the island after Hurricane Melissa.

“Just flying into Jamaica, you could look down and see that there was no vegetation left on any of the trees, roofs were blown off houses, and debris was everywhere,” said Medved, director-safety and security officer at the Fredericksburg, Virginia-based co-op.

“One child told us that the winds were so strong during the hurricane that it sounded like a lion, and it felt like he was awake in a nightmare.”

Hurricane Melissa was one of the most intense storms ever to hit Jamaica, killing 45 people as it pounded the small island with flooding rains and sustained winds of 185 mph at its peak. The hurricane, which made landfall Oct. 28, destroyed an estimated 75% of the nation’s electrical infrastructure and left most residents without running water as electric-powered pumping stations and treatment plants stopped working.

Jamaica Public Service Company reached out to NRECA International for help, and Medved and 10 other lineworkers from five electric cooperatives throughout the U.S. went to Jamaica from Dec. 1-19 to help restore power to the Discovery Bay area in Saint Anne Parish on the island’s north coast.

In addition to Rappahannock, volunteers came from Choptank Electric Cooperative in Denton, Maryland; First Electric Cooperative in Jacksonville, Arkansas; Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative in Palmyra, Missouri; and Steele-Waseca Co-op Electric in Owatonna, Minnesota.

Another team, with lineworkers from Missouri, is working to restore power to more homes, schools and small businesses in Jamaica this month.

Mike Malandro, president and CEO of Choptank, said it was an easy decision to send four lineworkers to Jamaica when they asked to go.

“If this was happening to us, I would hope that someone would send their crews to help,” he said.

Casey Butler, a chief lineman at Choptank, said he’d never seen people go so long without power after a disaster. He and Medved both volunteered in Jamaica in 2024 after Hurricane Beryl, but the damage was not as severe.

Despite more than a month without electricity, people were incredibly positive, breaking into cheers when the lights came back on anywhere, Butler said.

“In the United States, if the power is out for a day, you know people are going to be aggravated,” he said. “But the Jamaican people were super grateful for what we were doing. You’re not going to break Jamaica; people there were always in good spirits.”

Discovery Bay resident Dyane Reynolds was ecstatic at the thought of getting the power back on in her neighborhood.

“Oh my God, we’re going to have cold water … we’re going to have the [washing machine], we’re going to have the TV, we’re going to have everything we need to be comfortable again, to be back to normal.”

Bradie Boothe said he’d been spending about 4,000 Jamaican dollars—a little more than $25 in U.S. currency—every two days to pay for gas for a generator to power his home after the storm. He had to dip into his savings to fuel the generator since both he and his wife worked in the tourism industry, which came to an abrupt halt after the hurricane. There are so few visitors now that the volunteer lineworkers slept in a vacant hotel.

“Having reliable power back is a gamechanger for everybody,” Boothe said. “Petro has been so expensive. The return of power is a huge relief on everybody’s pocket.”

One of the biggest challenges for the volunteer lineworkers was patching electric infrastructure back together without a fleet of bucket trucks or other standard equipment and supplies. Jamaica Public Service had a bucket truck that they used at times, but most of the work involved climbing poles.

“It shows you can do a lot with almost nothing, using material from poles blown down on the ground,” said Jeff Thomas Jr., a chief lineman at Choptank. “We did a lot of recycling of materials and wire.”

Local residents pitched in by loaning the volunteers their extension ladders and bringing them jerk chicken and other local delicacies for lunch.

Calvin Jackson, a lead lineman at Rappahannock, had a tiny helper—a little boy, 3 or 4 years old, who came out of his house with his dad to watch the linemen work.

“He had his own little hard hat and plastic hammer, and he grabbed my hand,” Jackson said, chuckling. “He was going to work with me that day.”

Dean Samuel Jr., a Choptank serviceman, said he was impressed by how residents patched their partial roofs back together as best they could. They even invited neighbors to move in with them if the neighbors’ homes were in worse shape, he said.

“They made it work,” Samuel said.

The Jamaicans’ resiliency inspired the volunteers, said Jordan Watson, a journeyman lineworker for Choptank.

“It makes you want to work that much harder and put in the effort to get power back on for as many people as possible,” he said. “We estimated that we turned on power to about 800 to 1,200 meters in three weeks. We put a little dent in the big picture. If you can get one meter on, you’re changing people’s lives.”

“We will encourage the PSC to reject any rate increase in this matter,” she said.
The rate increase would cause that to go up $6,000 a month, or $72,000 a year, Sloan said.","This story was originally published by WEKU on Jan. 12, 2026.

Kentucky Power has offered a settlement to state regulators for its rate increase proposal, according to a series of filings Friday.

Kentucky Power proposed a rate increase of about 15% to the Kentucky Public Service Commission to take effect this year.

After hearing public pushback in three hearings in its service territory, it has proposed a smaller increase of 12%. The company will use deferred tax liabilities to reduce the increase further for two years.

With the tax deferrals, customers would see an 8% increase over current rates this year and a 9% increase next year.

In a statement, Kentucky Power spokeswoman Sarah Lynch said the company is “committed to balancing affordability with the investments needed to keep power reliable for eastern Kentucky.”

The Kentucky commission is supposed to hear the evidence in the case this week, starting Tuesday.

In one of its Friday filings, Kentucky Power asked the three-member commission to recess the hearing after public comments Tuesday to allow them more time to consider the settlement.

Kentucky Power asked the commission to approve its settlement agreement by March 1.

Lauren Adams, communications director for Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, noted that her office was not a party to the settlement.

“We will encourage the PSC to reject any rate increase in this matter,” she said.

On Dec. 30, the PSC approved Kentucky Power’s application to continue its 50% ownership of the Mitchell coal plant in West Virginia beyond 2028. The commission denied that request in 2021. Electricity customers will pay, on average, $2.33 more each month for those costs.

The company has said it will need to replace one of Mitchell’s concrete cooling towers in the next few years. It has not disclosed the estimated cost, citing confidentiality. It will need to seek approval from the PSC in Kentucky and West Virginia to recover the cost from customers.

On Thursday evening in Ashland, about 150 people gathered at the Ashland Transportation Center, a converted railroad freight station, to listen to residents and local officials testify to the PSC commissioners.

Many residents testified of the hardship their electricity bills have created for their families.

Local officials, including Louisa Mayor Harold Sloan, asked the commission to consider what would happen to water and sewer rates if the increase were approved.

He said the small city spends $40,000 a month on electricity for its water and sewer pumps. The rate increase would cause that to go up $6,000 a month, or $72,000 a year, Sloan said. Those additional costs would be passed on to residents who also would pay more for their electricity.

“That’s my concern with this tonight. What this will do to the water and sewer rates for our same customers, the same people that are here, can’t afford this,” he said. “That means our residents are hit twice, first through the increased electric bills, and then again through the increased water and wastewater rates.”

Louisa, with about 2,700 residents, is about 30 miles south of Ashland, where Kentucky Power is headquartered.

Until 2015, Kentucky Power generated electricity from coal at the Big Sandy plant in Louisa. That year, it shut down one of the plant’s two units and converted the other one to natural gas. It also purchased its 50% share in the Mitchell plant at the same time.

Adam Rice, a representative from the office of U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers spoke after Sloan. As in other public hearings on the matter, Rice blamed the Obama administration’s “war on coal” for the Big Sandy retirement.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011226_Ashland-KY-residents-at-PSC-meeting_CurtisTate_WEKU.webp,N,,2026-01-12 18:12:50.185161

The organization previewed the findings in a news release.

The organization's report, ‘Fixing America’s Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress,’ tracks national polling of US auto consumers from November 2023 through November 2025 and finds that Republican resistance to EVs has eased by 20 points over three years. At the same time, the organization says the end of federal consumer EV subsidies is dampening near-term demand, and that multifamily-home charging remains an untapped lever for growth.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" stated EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The data also highlight sharply polarized views of Elon Musk and Tesla, and growing openness among Americans under 45 to buying Chinese-made vehicles—trendlines with strategic implications for automakers and policymakers alike.

Inside the new report’s findings

EVs for All America’s latest survey series (600 registered voters each November from 2023 through 2025 in households earning $50,000+, plus targeted October 2024 and October 2025 samples) surfaces several notable through-lines:

The state strategy in a federal pause

EVs for All America urges states to lean in while federal support recedes, noting that roughly 80 percent of EVs are sold in just 15 states and that positive word of mouth in high-penetration markets helps pull in the next wave of buyers. State tools are already moving the needle: Rebates, utility-managed charging programs, right-to-charge laws for multifamily properties, and streamlined permitting can partially substitute for federal demand supports.

One practical lever in the near term is enabling overnight Level 2 charging in apartments and condos. Residential charging equipment may qualify for credits that can offset installation costs when placed in service before mid-2026, helping multifamily properties accelerate deployments.

Affordability, infrastructure, and the next two years

As of January 2026, the realities facing EV shoppers diverge by region. In states with robust incentives and denser charging networks, word of mouth and test-drive exposure continue to convert fence-sitters. Elsewhere, the combination of higher perceived upfront cost, financing conditions, and limited home charging—especially for renters—keeps demand choppy. Stabilizers that can soften the “post-subsidy” drag include the shift to lower-cost chemistries such as LFP in entry trims, more aggressive pricing and trim mixes, and a stronger focus on the used-EV market, where younger buyers are most price-sensitive.

If multifamily charging scales, used-EV financing matures, and the $25,000–$35,000 segment fills out with compelling products, the next leg of adoption can proceed even in a high-rate environment. The report’s generational finding—that under-45 consumers are broadly open to EVs, and more open than older cohorts to Chinese-made vehicles—implies that the contest for the next million US EV buyers will pivot less on ideology and more on price, software features, and convenience.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" stated Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs.""

Two immediate signals are worth monitoring in the near term. First, whether state budget cycles in leading EV markets expand rebates or accelerate right-to-charge requirements for multifamily properties, key to unlocking urban and suburban demand.

Second, the pace of local charging deployment aided by remaining. Both will influence whether performance-and-value messaging can overcome the loss of federal purchase incentives in 2026.

Bottom line

The partisan temperature around EVs seems to be coming down, a welcome development, if true. However, one could argue that the damage is already done: The GOP's winning 2024 presidential candidate and congressional allies spent much of 2025 taking measures widely recognized as slowing US EV adoption.

In any case, with federal consumer incentives curtailed or ended by late 2025 and rules in flux, it will be practicalities—price, charging access, and domestic industrial strength—as much as politics that will decide the pace of adoption in 2026. If state policies, OEM pricing, and community charging scale in tandem, the perceived thaw in attitudes could translate into real sales momentum. If not, the market will continue to drift—and younger buyers’ openness to Chinese brands could evolve from an attitudinal finding into a competitive reality for the US auto industry.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt71d32a5e409deb68/686ea32b4a604a089a44e0ec/Trump-OBBBA-2223602335.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-12 17:00:34.892814

Jeep® Brand

The Jeep brand is celebrating its 85th anniversary in 2026 by bringing its adventurous spirit to the auto show with a dynamic display that offers something for everyone.

Jeep vehicles on display include the Jeep Cherokee turbo hybrid, refreshed Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Grand Wagoneer, all-electric Jeep Recon and exclusive Jeep Wrangler buzz models.

The all-new 2026 Jeep Cherokee is the perfect blend of iconic design, capability and efficiency, providing customers with a midsize SUV only the Jeep brand could create. With a new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid engine, an estimated 37 mpg combined and more than 500 miles to a tank of fuel, the 2026 Cherokee is ready to take adventures further than ever – with zero compromises.

The brand's first fully electric, Trail Rated SUV in the industry – the Jeep Recon – will make its debut in Detroit. Engineered from the ground up for adventure, the Jeep Recon delivers legendary Jeep 4x4 capability in a fully electrified package. With 650 horsepower and 620 lb.-ft. of instant torque, the Jeep Recon offers precise control from the first touch of the throttle, accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in as little as 3.6 seconds. It's a bold, new expression of Jeep brand DNA, electrified and trail ready with an estimated all-electric range of up to 250 miles (based on trim).

In November in honor of the brand's milestone 85th birthday, Jeep launched a bold yearlong tribute as legendary as the brand itself. Each month for the next 12 months, a brand-new Jeep Wrangler buzz model will be revealed. Recently revealed Twelve 4 Twelve vehicles will be front and center in Detroit.

Camp Jeep will make a return appearance in Detroit. Auto show attendees will buckle up for a ride-along adventure that showcases the legendary off-road capability of the Jeep product line. Professional drivers take guests through a rugged course filled with steep climbs, sharp descents and challenging terrain.

Ram Brand

Ram celebrates the return of the legendary 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 engine to the 2026 Ram 1500 lineup, available on Tradesman, Express, Warlock, Big Horn/Lone Star, Laramie, Rebel, Limited and Longhorn. Now enhanced with standard eTorque mild hybrid technology, this iconic powertrain delivers 395 horsepower and 410 lb.-ft. of torque and snarls through a standard GT performance exhaust system.

Building on its legacy of uncompromising capability and performance, Ram is also bringing back two iconic nameplates for customers who demand the very best in power and durability. Making its public debut in Detroit, the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX returns as the fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world, featuring a supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI V-8 delivering 777 horsepower and 680 lb.-ft. of torque. The Ram 1500 SRT TRX pairs bold design with advanced engineering rooted in Ram's DNA.

The 2027 Ram 2500 Power Wagon expands the lineup with heavy-duty off-road confidence, now available with a 6.7-liter Cummins High-Output Turbo Diesel power for the first time. Designed to handle extreme conditions straight off the showroom floor, the Power Wagon combines advanced four-wheel-drive systems with purpose-built off-road hardware like front and rear locking differentials and a disconnecting sway bar, producing 430 horsepower and a best-in-class base diesel torque of 1,075 lb.-ft., while retaining its title as the most off-road-capable full-size pickup.

The Ram 1500 REV, a range-extended electric vehicle designed to disrupt one of the industry's most influential segments, will be on display as well. The Ram 1500 REV uses a 92 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack, paired with an on-board 130 kW generator, to deliver a targeted range of up to 690 miles.

Making its debut at an auto show, Ram's NASCAR race truck takes pole position in the Stellantis booth. The brand is roaring back into the NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series with the boldness only Ram Racing can deliver. This comeback is unlike anything from other OEMs, featuring a unique five-truck lineup. Three trucks will run full-time drivers, while a fourth will serve as a Free Agent, piloted by a different professional driver each week. The fifth truck will spotlight the winner of Ram's reality competition series, Race for the Seat. Produced in partnership with Thrill Sports Productions, this high-stakes series gives 15 aspiring drivers the ultimate opportunity: earn a seat in a Ram 1500 race truck with Kaulig Racing for the 2026 season.

Dodge Brand

Dodge brings serious muscle and innovation to the Detroit Auto Show with a bold multi-energy lineup of performance vehicles, from the HEMI-powered Durango GT, supercharged HEMI-powered 710-horsepower Dodge Durango SRT Jailbreak – now available in all 50 states – to the all-new 420-horsepower 2026 Dodge Charger R/T and the 550-horsepower SIXPACK-powered 2026 Charger Scat Pack.

Quick off the line with standard all-wheel drive (AWD), the new SIXPACK-powered high-output (H.O.), 550-horsepower, with 531 lb.-ft. of torque, Dodge Charger Scat Pack clocks a 3.9-second 0-60 time and runs the quarter mile in 12.2 seconds. It's the most powerful vehicle in the industry under $55,000.

The Dodge Charger Dayona delivers a 0-60 time of 3.3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 11.5 seconds, and is the world's quickest and most powerful muscle car.

The Charger lineup is the winner of several ""best of"" awards, with the all-new SIXPACK-powered Charger named the TopGear.com vehicle of the year in the U.S., as well as Detroit News 2025 Vehicle of the Year, while the multi-energy Charger lineup won the 2026 Detroit Free Press Car of the Year.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2026-01-12 21:14:50+00:00,WCBD News 2,Energy developers head to court as Trump says the US 'will not approve any windmills',"JENNIFER McDERMOTT, Associated Press, JENNIFER McDERMOTT, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.counton2.com/news/national-news/ap-energy-developers-head-to-court-as-trump-says-the-us-will-not-approve-any-windmills/,"Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.
We will not approve any windmills in this country.” The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

At Monday’s hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.","XCF is advancing its long-term growth strategy with the development of its SAF production platform, beginning with the planned construction of New Rise Reno 2.

Bank of America has been engaged to assist XCF in structuring potential debt financing for the project.

XCF is positioned for growth in a rapidly expanding SAF market projected to exceed $25 billion by 2030 and $250 billion by 2050.

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a leading innovator in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), announced today that it is evaluating financing options to support the next phase of its long-term growth strategy: the construction of its New Rise Reno 2 facility (“New Rise 2”).

If constructed, New Rise 2 is expected to enable XCF to expand its SAF and renewable fuel platform and aligns with its recently signed non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with global energy and commodities group BGN INT US LLC (“BGN”). As contemplated by the MOU, subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement, XCF and BGN intend to jointly develop global distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic markets.

XCF has engaged Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) to assist in structuring potential debt financing, which may qualify for certain export credit agency programs. There can be no assurance that any financing transaction will be completed or on what terms.

The global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion by 2030, with demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons, driven by regulatory mandates, airline decarbonization targets, and growing investor interest in low-carbon fuels. Longer term, the SAF market could exceed $250 billion by 2050 if decarbonization targets are achieved.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

“We look forward to working with Bank of America as we evaluate a range of financing options to support the next phase of our SAF production expansion at New Rise Reno 2 and advance our broader mission to decarbonize the aviation industry. With governments and airlines worldwide raising their sustainability commitments, expanding SAF production has never been more critical. Meeting the decarbonization targets of tomorrow requires making thoughtful, strategic investments today.”

Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, has a permitted nameplate production capacity of 38 million gallons per year, positioning XCF as an early mover among large-scale SAF producers in North America.

""We would not support repealing the endangerment finding for stationary sources,"" API President Mike Sommers told reporters, adding that the trade group believes it has ""the greatest standing"" from a regulatory perspective and it is clear the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from those sources.

The EPA plans to finalize its proposal to repeal its scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, called the endangerment finding. Such a move would remove within days the legal foundation that underpins all major climate regulations.

Reversal of the ""endangerment finding"" would gut one of the most consequential federal standards that had enabled the U.S. to tackle climate change by regulating vehicles, industries, and energy-producing facilities that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Environmental groups have said that the scientific finding made in 2009 is even less in dispute today and should be left intact, with vehicle emission rules Washington's biggest tool to combat climate change.

President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and global efforts to reduce emissions a ""con job.""

“The science establishing harm to human health and the environment from global warming emissions was evident in 2009 and it’s even more undeniable today,"" said Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Sommers said API believes that a separate endangerment finding for stationary sources should remain in place, which would require the EPA to regulate the potent greenhouse gas called methane from the oil and gas sector. The industry supports that rule.

The EPA has delayed by 18 months implementation of former President Joe Biden's methane rules.

""We were appreciative of the delays that EPA announced last year, and what we're doing now is working with them on crafting durable rules that we think are common sense and provide the flexibility needed to maintain production levels while still reducing emissions and incentivizing continued innovation in this space,"" API's senior vice president for regulatory affairs Dustin Meyer said.

RED BANK, NJ — Business Facilities is pleased to name North Carolina as its 2025 State of the Year. This annual award presented by Business Facilities for nearly two decades recognizes a state for its successful business climate and economic development growth in the previous year. The evaluation conducted by the editorial team focuses on significant factors impacting corporate relocation and expansion decisions. This marks the third time Business Facilities has recognized North Carolina, with the state selected as 2020 State of the Year and 2022 State of the Year.

In its evaluation for 2025 State of the Year, Business Facilities considered conditions related to education and workforce, business incentives, infrastructure, quality of life, and business attraction and retention investments. When it comes to workforce, North Carolina saw a record year — under Governor Josh Stein, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC) more than 33,000 job commitments were announced through November 2025.

Capital investments from new and expanding businesses across the state also reached significant levels in the past year. From aerospace to life sciences and from data centers to rare-earth supply chains, North Carolina’s advantages for business continued to shine in 2025 — attracting nearly $23 billion in overall project investment across 47 counties between January and November 2025.

Says Business Facilities Editorial Director Anne Cosgrove, “From JetZero choosing Greensboro, NC at the Piedmont Triad International Airport grounds for the site of its first commercial airplane manufacturing facility to biotech firm Genentech building a manufacturing plant in Wake County, the state’s economic development infrastructure supports the growth of new and existing companies. Emerging supply chains are being cultivated here as well. One example is Vulcan Elements, a manufacturer of rare-earth magnets locating in Johnston County for its rare-earth magnets facility with plans to invest nearly $1 billion and create 1,000 jobs.”

Opportunity-Rich States: 15 With Momentum

As part of the Business Facilities 2025 State of the Year evaluations, states with notable programs and successes are highlighted as 2025 Opportunity-Rich States. “As business leaders and site selectors faced uncertainty throughout 2025 amidst an already evolving site selection landscape, these states are highlighted for their business-friendly environments, with assets and incentives to meet the needs of those businesses,” says Cosgrove.

Across all three bills, House appropriators rejected the administration’s proposed deep cuts and substituted a more conventional spending plan.
That level is below FY2024 enacted funding of about $41.3 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of about $43.4 billion, both of which were carried forward under a full-year continuing resolution.
The National Park Service would see a moderate reduction from current levels, not the 37 percent cut included in the White House request.
The Justice Department Inspector General was funded at $139 million, roughly 43 percent above the administration’s request—an unmistakable signal about oversight priorities.","The House did something noteworthy last week. It passed three full-year FY2026 spending bills that look very little like the administration’s budget request.

These bills are not law yet. The Senate still has to act. But this is no longer just a committee marker. The House passed the measures with overwhelming bipartisan margins, which tells us something useful about where Congress appears willing to assert itself.

The package covers three of the twelve annual appropriations bills. One funds Interior and Environment, including most of the Department of the Interior, public lands agencies, EPA, and the National Park Service. Another funds Energy and Water, covering the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and federal water and power infrastructure. The third funds Commerce, Justice, and Science, from economic data and weather forecasting to law enforcement, courts, and basic scientific research.

Across all three bills, House appropriators rejected the administration’s proposed deep cuts and substituted a more conventional spending plan. The differences are not subtle.

The Interior and Environment bill provides $38.6 billion in discretionary budget authority, about $9.5 billion—or roughly 33 percent—above the administration’s request. That level is below FY2024 enacted funding of about $41.3 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of about $43.4 billion, both of which were carried forward under a full-year continuing resolution. The Energy and Water bill provides $58.0 billion, more than $3.5 billion above the administration’s request and roughly in line with FY2024 and FY2025 enacted levels. Commerce, Justice, and Science comes in at $81.3 billion, roughly $17 billion—or about 26 percent—above what the White House proposed, but below FY2024 enacted funding of $83.5 billion and FY2025 enacted funding of $82.5 billion.

Those toplines are reinforced by specific programmatic choices. EPA would face a 4 percent cut, or about $320 million, rather than the more than $4 billion reduction proposed by the administration. The National Park Service would see a moderate reduction from current levels, not the 37 percent cut included in the White House request.

Congress didn’t just protect funding. It also redirected it. Trade agencies received notable increases, including an 18 percent boost for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and a 23 percent increase for the Commerce Department office responsible for export controls aimed at China and other countries. The Justice Department Inspector General was funded at $139 million, roughly 43 percent above the administration’s request—an unmistakable signal about oversight priorities.

Taken together, this is not a spending spree. It is a refusal to implement the administration’s budget as written. That distinction matters in the current context. Over the past year, appropriations have increasingly been treated as provisional. Funds approved by Congress have been delayed or slow-walked through impoundments. Obligations have been pushed past the point where programs can operate as intended. Rescissions have been proposed long after spending decisions were made, sometimes structured to expire if Congress does not act, effectively daring lawmakers to intervene or accept cuts by default.

Seen in that light, these bills look less like generosity and more like self-defense. When appropriators specify funding levels program by program and reject sweeping reductions, they limit how much room exists for quiet rewrites later.

The hardest tests are still ahead. Defense and Labor-HHS-Education—nearly 70 percent of discretionary spending—remain unresolved. And even if Congress finishes the job, it will still have to enforce it. Appropriations only matter if Congress is willing to respond when they are ignored.

For now, this package is best read as a signal. Congress is reminding the executive branch—and itself—that writing the check is not a suggestion. Whether that reminder sticks will be one of the real tests of 2026.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Congress-1024x536.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:00:48.748862

,American Energy,2026-01-12 20:48:02+00:00,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Iowa ethanol industry blames 'stagnant' production on lack of carbon sequestration,"Cami Koons, Robin Opsahl",,,,,https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/iowa-ethanol-industry-blames-stagnant-production-on-lack-of-carbon-sequestration/,"A proposed carbon sequestration pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions would connect to Iowa ethanol plants and transport their sequestered carbon dioxide to an underground storage site.
According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.
Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.
Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.
“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said.","Iowa produced 4.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025 — a figure consistent with the past two years and one that Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says could be higher if Iowa had access to carbon sequestration technologies.

The call for carbon capture and sequestration comes from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association at the start of Iowa’s 2026 legislative session, where debate around property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines are set to be top priority.

A proposed carbon sequestration pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions would connect to Iowa ethanol plants and transport their sequestered carbon dioxide to an underground storage site. This would allow ethanol plants to participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol industry to produce things like sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel, but the project has been contested in legal and legislative settings by landowners who feel the pipeline is not a public use worthy of the power of eminent domain.

Under eminent domain, unwilling landowners can be forced to accept easements on their property at a price set by a county commission for projects considered in the public interest.

Nationally, the U.S. produced 16.4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025, according to the national Renewable Fuels Association. IRFA pointed out in a news release that while national ethanol production has increased annually over the past five years, Iowa production has remained “stagnant” at 4.6 billion gallons annually since 2023.

While Iowa remains the top ethanol producing state in the country, in 2025 the Hawkeye State produced 28% of the nation’s ethanol supply, which is less than the share it produced in 2023 and 2024 when Iowa accounted for roughly 30% of the national share, according to the association.

Figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that increased ethanol production in the country has been driven primarily by a rise in ethanol exports. In March 2025, fuel ethanol demand for the month was equivalent to about 465 million bushels of corn, which was a 60-million bushel increase in monthly demand from 10 years prior.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said Iowa is “behind in the race” as other states work to take advantage of incentives and market benefits of ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Investment dollars flow to areas with a perceived competitive advantage,” Shaw said in a news release. “The states attracting significant investment have one thing in common – the ability to sequester carbon either locally or via pipeline infrastructure.”

In addition to expanded markets, low carbon ethanol fuel producers and CO2 transportation pipelines are eligible for federal tax credits known as 45Z and 45Q.

According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.

Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Iowa continues to have a significant lead over other states in ethanol production capacity with nearly double the number of plants in Nebraska.

“There is no reason why Iowa plants won’t grow in the near future if we maintain their access to the tools and technologies to compete,” Shaw said.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year that restricted carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to utilize eminent domain in the state, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds.

Landowners opposing the pipeline project plan to lobby, beginning Tuesday, for similar legislation this year to limit the project’s ability to take land for its construction against landowner wishes.

The Summit pipeline has also been affected by a ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines through South Dakota. Recent filings from the company indicate it may change paths, pending state approval, to avoid crossing through South Dakota.

Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said. “IRFA will continue to support legislation that enhances landowner rights, streamlines the permitting process, and maintains a viable path forward for CCS. Our future depends on it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/adkins-ethanol-plant-lena-IL-_-Getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:12:58.097215

We and our partner organizations provide critically important, data-driven programs that cut red tape, provide affordable energy choices, and expand American energy dominance nationally.","(Washington, D.C. – January 12, 2026) The U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia ruled today that the Trump administration violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements when it cancelled millions of dollars in federal grants for clean, affordable energy and transportation projects based on the states in which the grantees were located. The projects would save American families money, reduce air pollution and protect people’s health.

“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024 … Defendants offer no explanation for how their purposeful segregation of grantees based on their electoral support for President Trump rationally advances their stated government interest,” the court’s decision states. “Plaintiffs … put it best: ‘There’s no federal funding exception to the Equal Protection Clause.’” (Opinion, pages 10, 12, 13)

The City of St. Paul, Elevate Energy, Environmental Defense Fund, Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Plug In America, and the Southeast Community Organization, filed a lawsuit after they lost grants, or partnered with groups that lost grants, because the administration targeted the states in which they were located. The lawsuit challenged the cancellation of those Congressionally appropriated Department of Energy grants for reasons the administration clearly and publicly stated were to punish certain states. On October 1st, U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russel Vought announced the 16 states where cancellations would occur. The next day, more details emerged showing $7.5 billion in cancelled grants and awards from 315 projects – every single one of which was to a grantee located in a state that voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election and with two Senators who caucus with the Democratic party.

The coalition lawsuit argued that the administration’s action violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment – which guarantees Americans equal protection under the law. Today the court agreed.

QUOTES

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law. The administration’s damaging actions violated the U.S. Constitution, foundational American values, and basic decency, and it imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives.” – Vickie Patton, General Counsel, Environmental Defense Fund

“The court ruling in favor of Elevate is a step toward keeping clean energy affordable and advancing initiatives nationwide. By protecting these grants, we can continue to create jobs, lower energy costs, and expand access to clean energy, bringing us closer to a cleaner, stronger, and more sustainable future. This decision is for the communities across the country who should not have to choose between paying their energy bills and feeding their families. Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible.” – Dr. Anne Evens, CEO, Elevate Energy

Our industry focus results in comprehensive state-of-the-art knowledge of the commercial, legal and governmental challenges faced by our clients and enables us to provide innovative solutions to facilitate transactions and resolve disputes.

Our Beginning. On November 1, 1945, two brothers, Searcy and Fentress Bracewell, just home from their World War II service, joined their father, J. S. Bracewell, and another leading Houston lawyer to open the doors of a new Houston law firm. From the beginning, the Bracewells understood that for their firm to succeed they must maintain a relentless focus on professional excellence. As they dreamed of building a larger firm, they also understood that the firm’s roots must be deeply embedded in a culture emphasizing personal relationships and teamwork. Finally, based on J. S. Bracewell’s great success as a statewide and community leader before the war, the Bracewells believed that a commitment to public and community service should be a key component of their firm. More than seventy years later, this commitment to professional excellence, to personal relationships and teamwork, and to public and community service remain the cornerstones of our partnership.

Born in the Courtroom. Our reputation for professional excellence began in the courtroom. J. S. Bracewell was well known as a fierce and relentless litigator, and the post-war era saw the firm assume and extend that reputation. From that beginning, our reputation for professional excellence grew from insurance defense to labor, tax, condemnation and business litigation. In the 1960s and early 1970s, as the growing Texas economy began to attract business enterprises from all over the world, as well as financing from money center banks, our litigation practice evolved to the representation of stakeholders in large-scale commercial disputes.

Development of our Business Practice. As the energy and financial services sectors grew dramatically in Texas in the 1970s, the firm’s reputation for professional excellence attracted clients focused on transactional and commercial matters. This inspired firm leaders to significantly expand the firm’s transactional practice, and in the mid-1970s the firm began adding like-minded partners focused on corporate transactions and bank finance. Our firm’s reputation in the courtroom was soon matched by our growing reputation for handling major M&A transactions and financings.",https://natlawreview.com/themes/custom/nlr_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:25.122046

The EPA requested consent to access the property shortly after on May 27, 2025.","The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lead a cleanup effort at a Yuma, Arizona, warehouse after the Yuma Community Food Bank was made aware of electronic waste housed in its facility.

The warehouse, located at 2404 E. 24th St. in Yuma, houses 3.92 million pounds of abandoned material, created from 2012 to 2015 by a glass recycling company, which the EPA names as Down Management LLC, also known as Attan Recycling Corporation (Dow/Attan), in a document.

The EPA has assured the city that the food bank will remain unaffected and will continue to serve the community throughout the cleanup project. The EPA also stated in a fact sheet about the project that “this material is sealed in boxes and held in an area of the warehouse separate from the food bank.”

The glass recycling company abandoned TV and computer screens with glass vacuum cathode ray tubes (CRTs). The EPA says the glass and parts from these devices hold hazardous material, mainly lead. The agency will properly dispose of the waste and debris in a certified landfill.

Atlas Technical Consultants LLC performed a Phase 1 environmental site assessment at the request of the food bank.

According to the site assessment document provided through the EPA’s admininistrative record, the area of the building was contaminated by Dow/Attan’s improper CRT destruction and materials management between 2012 through 2015. This area is separated from the food bank by a floor to ceiling “wall” constructed of chain-link fence covered with poly sheeting.

“Atlas estimates the amount of CRT hazardous waste to be 660 Gaylord totes located inside the warehouse and another 600 tons of wrapped CRT hazardous waste located outside in the northwest corner of the parking lot,” according to the document. “The total estimated amount of CRT hazardous waste is 1,960 tons or 3.92 million pounds.”

According to the document, Dow/Attan was investigated by the ADEQ between 2014 and 2017, at which time the company was out of business and the responsible parties had fled the country.

Following the assessment, ADEQ requested assistance from the EPA on May 8, 2025. The EPA requested consent to access the property shortly after on May 27, 2025.

The on-scene coordinator for EPA Region 9 was granted funding approval on Aug. 27, 2025. “This funding is necessary to address the release of hazardous substances into the environment, specifically dust containing lead, cadmium, arsenic, barium and chromium,” the coordinator says in a memorandum that requested approval to spend up to $4 million in direct extramural costs to perform a time critical removal action and to request an exemption from the $2 million statutory limit.

The cleanup will be completed in two phases. The first will consist of set up and waste removal and the second will cover cleanup of the rest of the warehouse.

The EPA says that it will begin the first phase by sealing the room housing the material using a layer of large plastic sheets with a vacuum seal, which will trap any debris or dust in the area.

The agency also will install air monitoring and sampling devices inside and outside the sealed work area and will then remove the material in covered boxes from the back entrance of the warehouse and truck to a landfill.

In the second phase, the EPA will wipe down all surfaces in the area, including the ceilings, take the vacuum-sealed plastic sheet out of the removal area and as an extra safety step, workers will wipe the rest of the warehouse’s surfaces and ceiling down, including the Yuma Community Food Bank area.

The memorandum says that the first phase is expected to be completed within three weeks, and the second will be completed within the following five weeks.

What happens now? - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/2025-not-great-year-for-green-steel,"The manufacturer SSAB planned to produce iron — the key ingredient in steel — using green hydrogen in Mississippi.
But now the U.S. green hydrogen boom itself has collapsed, taking the steel industry’s ambitions down with it.
At the dawn of 2026, America’s steel producers have no major green hydrogen initiatives slated to start this decade.
But while it may seem as if the industry has given up on decarbonizing U.S. steel production, the reality is much more nuanced.
Based on what’s happened in recent years, I’d be surprised if Nippon Steel plans to source green hydrogen for the project.","I spent much of 2024 writing about the ambitious plans that U.S. steelmakers had to clean up the coal-reliant industry. But by the start of 2025, it was fast becoming clear that those green-steel dreams were in serious trouble.

Under the Biden administration, two big companies had proposed pioneering projects for cleaner steelmaking that were slated to receive $1 billion in federal support and would serve the growing market for lower-carbon metal. The industry seemed poised to begin a new chapter in the storied history of American iron and steel.

The manufacturer SSAB planned to produce iron — the key ingredient in steel — using green hydrogen in Mississippi. Then early last January, I saw the Swedish company had quietly withdrawn from award negotiations with the U.S. Department of Energy following the demise of its would-be hydrogen supplier, Hy Stor Energy. Soon after, President Donald Trump took office for a second time, moving swiftly to rescind grants and dismantle federal programs meant to advance clean energy and curb industrial emissions.

It wasn’t long before Cleveland-Cliffs, the other award recipient, shelved its own initiative for a hydrogen-ready ironmaking plant in Ohio. Today, the company is working with the Trump administration to develop a new scope for the project, one that preserves the use of fossil fuels. And SSAB recently told me that it’s not planning to revive any hydrogen-based projects in the United States.

Green hydrogen, which is made with renewable energy, has long been considered the Holy Grail for decarbonizing heavy industries because it can be used to replace fossil fuels in existing technologies and manufacturing methods. But now the U.S. green hydrogen boom itself has collapsed, taking the steel industry’s ambitions down with it.

At the dawn of 2026, America’s steel producers have no major green hydrogen initiatives slated to start this decade. Supplies of the low-carbon fuel remain scarce and expensive, and there’s no serious, coordinated attempt by the U.S. government to help resolve these stubborn barriers to cleaner steelmaking.

But while it may seem as if the industry has given up on decarbonizing U.S. steel production, the reality is much more nuanced.

Despite the high-profile retreats, manufacturers are still steadily making progress to clean up the country’s nearly 2-century-old industry. Legacy companies are investing in new steel-recycling mills, and startups are building facilities and raising private funding to scale novel technologies. Tech giants are boosting demand for cleaner construction materials as they work to limit the climate impact of the data center boom.

So what should we expect in the year ahead? There is no one clear path forward in the transition to greener steelmaking but rather many winding roads, with some heading toward progress and others looping back to the past. Here are three broad developments I’ll be keeping an eye on.

Coal-fueled furnaces will continue firing up

America’s modern steel era began in the late 19th century, fueled by scorching blast furnaces that use coke — a purified form of coal — to transform iron ore into molten iron, which is then turned into steel. This is still the main way that virgin, or ​“primary,” steel is made today, and it’s responsible for the bulk of the industry’s carbon emissions and toxic air pollution.

In recent decades, U.S. manufacturers have largely shifted to making ​“secondary” steel by recycling scrap metal in electric arc furnaces. But a dozen blast furnaces still operate in a handful of states, and their owners say they’re committed to keeping the facilities running well into the future.

U.S. Steel, which is now a subsidiary of Japan’s Nippon Steel, is set to ​“reline” its largest blast furnace in Gary, Indiana — a major maintenance project that could extend the aging furnace’s operating life by up to 20 years. In late December, U.S. Steel’s board of directors approved $350 million for the undertaking. The company also announced that it will restart operations at an idled blast furnace in southern Illinois to meet rising demand for domestic steel.

Cleveland-Cliffs, which relined one of its blast furnaces in Cleveland in 2022, plans to make similar upgrades at two other mills. The company will reline a blast furnace in Burns Harbor, Indiana, in 2027 and do the same in Middletown, Ohio — the site of its previous hydrogen project — ​“in the next four to five years,” according to CEO Lourenco Goncalves.

“Reality is back. La-la land is gone,” he said about the change of plans during an earnings call last May.

The manufacturers argue that propping up existing infrastructure is the better choice economically for maintaining and expanding their steelmaking capacity, versus building a new furnace or adopting other technologies. In the long run, however, those coal-fueled furnaces could become big liabilities as automakers, data center developers, and other key customers look to suppliers that offer less-carbon-intensive metal.

“The real challenge, from a technology perspective, is that there’s not really a path for a blast furnace to make the [low-carbon] products that are increasingly being demanded in the market,” said Kaitlyn Ramirez, a senior associate in RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries Program. ​“There’s no solution that’s going to be cost-competitive to do that.” She added that the relining decisions represent a ​“window of opportunity” for steel producers to pivot away from coal instead.

Scrap recycling will scale with clean energy

Even as the two steel giants throw a lifeline to a few old dirty furnaces, they and other companies are still making investments to expand lower-carbon production of the ubiquitous, sturdy metal.

Nippon Steel, for its part, recently announced plans to build a $4 billion plant somewhere in the U.S. with two new electric arc furnaces, which typically combine a little bit of iron with a lot of scrap metal. These facilities can curb carbon emissions by 75%, compared to traditional steel mills, because they require using dramatically less coal, a figure that will grow as the nation’s grid increasingly runs on clean energy, according to industry reports.

Its subsidiary U.S. Steel already operates a sprawling steel-recycling operation in Osceola, Arkansas. I visited the Big River Steel site in late 2023, when U.S. Steel was building a second multibillion-dollar plant to make steel specifically for electric vehicle motors, solar panels, and power generators and transformers. Right next door was a field of flattened dirt where Entergy’s 250-megawatt solar farm was soon to be installed.

U.S. Steel finished the construction last year, and the company plans to buy enough clean electricity from the completed solar project to cover 40% of the second plant’s operations. Major steel recyclers like Nucor and Steel Dynamics have also struck deals with clean energy developers in other states to help reduce the emissions associated with running their power-hungry furnaces.

U.S. Steel is also set to construct a ​“direct reduced iron” facility at the Big River Steel site as it works to lead the industry in ​“advanced, sustainable steel production,” spokesperson Amanda Malkowski told the Arkansas news site Talk Business & Politics.

Neither Nippon Steel nor its subsidiary has given many specifics about the new ironmaking project. But most DRI facilities operating today use fossil gas to remove oxygen from iron ore, which yields lumps of iron that are fed into electric arc furnaces. This process emits about half as much CO2 as a coal-fired blast furnace. Using green hydrogen can curb overall emissions even further, by up to 90%, experts say.

Based on what’s happened in recent years, I’d be surprised if Nippon Steel plans to source green hydrogen for the project. But another major steelmaker claims to be committed to using the fuel down the road. Hyundai Motor Group says it plans to build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana by 2029 that will include a DRI facility and an electric arc furnace. The Korean automaker reportedly intends to start producing green hydrogen at the facility in 2034, though it hasn’t said much publicly about how it will manage such a feat.

Global pressure for greener steel will only grow

Industrial giants aren’t the only ones working to clean up U.S. steelmaking. A handful of well-funded startups are steadily advancing newer ways of making the high-strength metal without using coal.

Last year, Boston Metal said it gotten one step closer to commercializing its ​“molten oxide electrolysis” technology after it fired up an industrial-size reactor at its facility in Massachusetts. Electra unveiled the site of its first demonstration plant in Colorado, where the company will produce iron with electrochemical devices powered by renewables. And in Texas, the startup Hertha Metals is turning iron ore directly into steel using a high-temperature, single-step process that currently runs on fossil gas but could switch to green hydrogen whenever supplies become commercially available, Hertha’s CEO Laureen Meroueh told me.

These novel efforts are drawing investment from not just global mining giants and metals manufacturers but also companies that use lots of steel — and see the material as a major source of their own supply chain emissions. Meta, for example, has agreed to buy certificates from Electra that will allow the tech company to count the emissions reductions associated with each ton of Electra’s clean iron toward Meta’s climate targets.

“Many of the long-term-focused large companies are looking at sustainability goals that last 10 to 20 years,” said Greg Matlock, the Americas metals and mining tax leader at accounting firm Ernst & Young. ​“Regardless of what the current political landscape is, I do think there’s absolutely still an appetite [for industrial decarbonization], and it’s a global appetite.”

The European Union is driving much of that global momentum. On Jan. 1, the 27-member bloc began implementing a carbon border tariff, which charges fees on imports of steel, aluminum, and other industrial products made in dirtier facilities abroad. The idea is to level the playing field for European manufacturers that invest in cleaner and potentially costlier facilities, while also encouraging other countries to regulate their own industrial CO2 emissions.

The carbon tariff won’t directly affect U.S. steelmakers all that much, given that they export only a tiny amount of metal to EU-member countries. But the policy’s ripple effects are already transforming the broader industry and putting pressure on all steel producers to modernize and clean up. Countries such as Brazil and Turkey have introduced domestic carbon-pricing policies in response to the EU’s moves. China has started shipping steel made using hydrogen to Italy, which experts say could set the stage for boosting Chinese green-steel exports.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Electric-Arc-Furnace.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=691f0182a1464f15d02156c0f8849fd7,N,,2026-01-12 19:59:27.603089

(January 12, 2026)—The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued final nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standards for new stationary gas turbines, including new gas-fired power plants. These standards, which have not been updated since 2006, have taken on increased importance with the surge of new gas-fired power plant proposals cropping up around the country to meet speculated new data center electricity demand; however, the final rule is significantly weaker than the 2024 proposal and includes new polluter loopholes. In a major departure from precedent and long-standing best practice, EPA also declined to quantify the public health impacts associated with changes in pollution levels due to this rule.

Below is a statement by Julie McNamara, associate policy director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“Communities across the country are scrambling to fight the threat of surging pollution harms from new fossil gas plants built to meet insatiable data center electricity demand. Instead of protecting people’s health, however, these deficient new gas turbine standards make clear Trump’s EPA is only here to boost the profits of Big Tech and the fossil fuel interests that serve them.

“Despite the ready availability and unquestionable public benefit of rigorous pollution controls, EPA Administrator Zeldin instead issued a rule rife with polluter loopholes.

Innovation Fund 25 Heat Auction

The European Commission is preparing the first pan-European industrial process heat auction – the IF25 Heat Auction. The call opened on 4 December 2025, with a total budget of EUR 1 billion.

Scope and objective

The auction supports projects that electrify industrial process heat (e.g. heat pumps/MVR, electric boilers, resistive heating, induction, plasma and shockwave heating) as well as projects using direct renewable heat (solar thermal and geothermal) in industrial processes. The objective is to achieve cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to accelerate the market uptake of industrial process heat decarbonisation technologies.

The auction covers two thematic areas (temperature baskets):

Low-temperature basket: 100–400°C, indicative budget of EUR 500 million.

High-temperature basket: >400°C, indicative budget of EUR 500 million.

Unused funds may be reallocated between the baskets.

Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) must be carried out within an energy management system compliant with ISO 50001 or EMAS, including the measurement of temperature and heat flow.

Support structure

Support will be granted in the form of a fixed premium per tonne of CO₂ avoided through the production of eligible industrial process heat (EUR/tCO₂). The premium will be paid on a semi-annual basis for a maximum period of five years from the date the installation enters the Entry into Operation phase, in proportion to the verified output.

Projects meeting the eligibility requirements will be ranked solely on the basis of the bid price per tonne of CO₂ avoided.

The application must declare the thermal capacity and the annual volume of avoided CO₂ emissions, aggregated over the entire five-year support period.

The maximum grant amount is up to EUR 100 million for projects in the 100–400°C basket and up to EUR 250 million for high-temperature projects (>400°C).

Key project requirements:

Project location: The installation must be located within the EEA and implemented at a single physical site (no “virtual” aggregation of capacity from different locations).

Scale and process parameters: The project must achieve at least 3 MWth of eligible process heat capacity and operate at a temperature of ≥100°C, in line with the relevant temperature basket.

Eligible scope: Support is limited strictly to industrial process heat. Space heating, heat sales to district heating networks, and electric arc furnaces are excluded. Processes that are already largely electrified may also be excluded from eligibility..

New production capacity: Only new low-emission heat capacity is eligible for support. Projects involving the construction of new fossil-fuel-based capacity are, as a rule, not eligible, except in cases explicitly permitted under the call documentation. The use of heat pumps recovering waste heat from existing fossil-fuel-based installations may be allowed.

Strategic importance of the programme

The IF25 Heat Auction supports the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal and serves as a pilot for the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank, enhancing cost transparency and directing funding towards verified and measurable climate outcomes.

Through the Auctions-as-a-Service (AaaS) model, EEA countries may co-finance projects using national funds based on a common procedure; data on winning bids will be made public.

Indicative timeline:

Call opening: 4 December 2025

Call closure: 19 February 2026.

Announcement of results (projects invited to sign grant agreements): May–June 2026

Signature of grant agreements: by November 2026

If that timeline holds, Indiana won’t be the only state to see Tesla Insurance arrive in March. As we told you earlier today, Tesla recently submitted a similar filing to also expand their insurance program to Tennessee. Under the program in both states, Tesla will track how much of a driver’s monthly mileage is completed with FSD (Supervised) enabled, and an insurance discount will be canulated monthly and applied to the policy.

That discount is layered on top of Tesla’s broader telematics-based pricing model, using the company’s Safety Score system, which has become the foundation of its insurance business. The score evaluates real-world driving behaviour, including hard braking, aggressive turning, speeding, following distance, and mileage. These factors are recalculated every 30 days, allowing premiums to rise or fall based on how a customer actually drives.

In California, Tesla Insurance is not allowed to use real-time telematics or driving behaviour to set premiums, as state regulations prohibit insurers from basing rates on live vehicle data.

The Indiana and Tennessee filings come just days after Tesla broke a three-year expansion drought by launching Tesla Insurance in Florida, its first new state since 2022.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday doubled down on California’s commitment to electric vehicles with proposed rebates intended to backfill federal tax credits canceled by the Trump administration.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles. It was part of a sweeping $348.9-billion state budget proposal released Friday, which also included items to address air pollution and worsening wildfires, amid a projected $3-billion state deficit.

EVs have become a flashpoint in California’s battle against the Trump administration, which moved last year to repeal the state’s long-held authority to set strict tailpipe emission standards and eventually ban the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California’s Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. “This incentive program will help continue the state’s ZEV momentum, especially with the federal administration eliminating the federal EV tax credit and carpool lane access.”

Newsom had previously flip-flopped on this idea, first vowing to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars and then walking it back in September. That same month, a group of five automakers including Honda, Rivian, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Audi wrote a letter urging Newsom and state legislators to establish a $5,000 EV tax rebate to replace the lost federal incentives, Politico reported.

During his State of the State speech Thursday—one year after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles—Newsom said California “refuse[s] to be bystanders” while China and other nations take the lead on electric vehicles and the clean energy transition. He touted the state’s investments in solar, hydrogen, wind and nuclear power, as well as its recent move away from the use of any coal-fired power.

“We must continue our prudent fiscal management, funding our reserves, and continuing the investments Californians rely on, from education to public safety, all while preparing for Trump’s volatility outside our control,” the governor said in a statement. “This is what responsible governance looks like.”

Several environmental groups had been urging Newsom to invest more in clean air and clean vehicle programs, which they say are critical to the state’s ambitious goals for human health and the environment. Transportation is the largest source of climate and air pollution in California and is responsible for more than a third of global warming emissions, said Daniel Barad, Western states policy manager with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

“As federal attacks threaten California’s authority to protect public health, incentives are more essential than ever to scale up clean cars and trucks,” Barad said. “The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California senior director with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, called it “an essential step to save money for Californians, cut harmful pollution, spur innovation, and support the global competitiveness of our auto industry.”

While the budget proposal does not include significant new spending proposals, it contains other line items relating to climate and the environment. Among them are plans to continue implementing Proposition 4, the $10 billion climate bond approved by voters in 2024 for programs geared toward wildfire resilience, safe drinking water, flood management, extreme heat mitigation and other similar efforts.

Among $2.1 billion in climate bond investments proposed this year are $58 million for wildfire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects in vulnerable communities, and nearly $20 million to assist homeowners with defensible space to prevent fire. Water-related investments include $232 million for flood control projects and nearly $70 million to support repairs to existing or new water conveyance projects.

The proposal also lays out how to spend money from California’s signature cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions. State lawmakers last year voted to extend the program through 2045 and rename it cap-and-invest.

The spending plan includes a new tiered structure for cap-and-invest that first funds statutory obligations such as manufacturing tax exemptions, followed by $1 billion for the high-speed rail project, $750 million to support the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and finally secondary program funding such as affordable housing and low-carbon transit options.

But while some groups applauded the budget’s broad handling of climate issues, others criticized it for leaning too heavily on volatile funding sources for environmental priorities, such as special funds and one-time allocations.

The Sierra Club called the EV incentive program a crucial investment but said too many other items were left with “patchwork strategies that make long-term planning harder.”

“Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk. That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,” said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.

California Environmental Voters, meanwhile, stressed that the state should continue to work toward legislation that would hold oil and gas companies liable for damages caused by their emissions—a plan known as “Make Polluters Pay” that stalled last year amid fierce lobbying and industry pressure.

“Instead of asking families to absorb the costs, the Legislature must look seriously at holding polluters accountable for the harm they’ve caused,” said Shannon Olivieri Hovis, California Environmental Voters’ chief strategy officer.

Sarah Swig, Newsom’s senior advisor for climate, noted that the state’s budget plan came just days after Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major global treaty signed by nearly 200 countries with the aim of addressing global warming through coordinated international action.

“California is not slowing down on climate at a time when we continue to see attack after attack from the federal government, including as recently as this week with the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the UNFCCC,” Swig told reporters Friday. “California’s leadership has never mattered more.”

ICE

Washington, D.C. — Twelve Members of Congress have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The Members filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order affirmed all Members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

The lawsuit, Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Rep. Norma Torres, Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; and Rep. Raul Ruiz.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

LENEXA, KAN. (JAN. 12, 2025) – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proud to announce significant progress remediating lead-contaminated properties throughout EPA Region 7, marking more environmental cleanup milestones in the nation’s heartland. During 2025, EPA Region 7 cleaned up over 775 residential properties and removed 1,098,965 cubic yards of waste.

“The work EPA Region 7 staff completed this year cleaning up lead from historic mining operations was no small feat,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy. “By hitting our 2025 targets, EPA is delivering on our promise to protect communities from exposure to lead and we look forward to continuing to work with our state and local partners in 2026 to ensure that our cleanup operations throughout the heartland are efficient, effective, and protective.”

Removing lead across our nation is key to fulfilling EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment and is especially important for reducing exposure for children. Across EPA’s Region 7 states, the agency has overseen the cleanup of over 29,000 residential properties and the removal and disposal of over 45 million cubic yards of waste since cleanups started at the following sites:

Old Lead Belt and the Viburnum Trend

In 2025, EPA led, or oversaw potentially responsible parties, cleanup of 439 residential properties and the removal of 139,039 cubic yards of waste in Missouri’s historic Old Lead Belt and the Viburnum Trend.

Tri-State Mining District

In 2025, EPA led the cleanup of 97 residential properties and the removal of 927,393 cubic yards of waste in the Kansas and Missouri sections of the historic Tri-State Mining District. This number does not include cleanup efforts going on at the Tar Creek Superfund Site, since the site is being remediated by the Quapaw Nation and the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

Former Smelter Sites

In 2025, EPA led the cleanup of 239 residential properties and the removal of 32,533 cubic yards of waste at former smelter sites across Region 7.

The former smelter sites include Caney Residential Yards, Cherokee Zinc – Weir Smelter, and Former United Zinc and Associated Smelters in Kansas; and Omaha Lead in Nebraska.

In 2025, EPA Region 7 awarded $3.3 million in cooperative agreements to six county health departments throughout the Old Lead Belt, the Tri-State Mining District, and to the Douglas County Health Department in Nebraska. Cooperative agreements with county health departments help fund continued lead health education and outreach for EPA’s local partners to raise awareness about elevated blood lead levels and the steps families can take to reduce potential exposure to lead.

EPA Region 7 will continue its work remediating residential yards impacted by lead mining and removing mine waste from local communities throughout the heartland. The agency is committed to fulfilling its core mission of protecting human health and the environment and looks forward to building on this throughout 2026.

The state’s App Store Accountability Act (the “Act”) becomes effective on January 1, 2026.
Scope The Act imposes obligations on both app store owners and app developers that make applications available to Texas users.
App Developers are developers of software applications that are made available to users through an app store.
Key Requirements for App Developers App Rating Designation: Developers must assign age ratings for each app and purchase and clearly disclose the content or elements of the app or purchase that informed that rating.","A federal judge in the Western District of Texas granted preliminary injunctions (here and here) blocking enforcement of the state’s App Store Accountability Act (the “Act”), preventing the law from taking effect on January 1, 2026. The injunctions were issued following preliminary-injunction motions brought in October 2025 by advocacy groups, the Computer & Communications Industry Association and Students Engaged in Advancing Texas.

The court concluded that the Act likely violates the First Amendment because it imposes content-based restrictions on speech by conditioning access to app store content on age verification and parental consent and fails to satisfy the strict scrutiny standard that applies to such restrictions. In particular, the court found, inter alia, that the Act’s sweeping application to all apps, regardless of content, was not narrowly tailored to the state’s interest in mitigating the alleged mental and physical health effects of mobile app usage.

The Texas attorney general filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit the same day the injunction was issued. While the Act remains enjoined and companies are not currently required to implement its age-verification and parental-consent regime, app stores and app developers should continue to consider potential compliance obligations, as the law could be reinstated on appeal.

Please see our previous alert regarding the Texas law below.

A new Texas law is poised to significantly reshape how app stores and developers manage users under 18. The state’s App Store Accountability Act (the “Act”) becomes effective on January 1, 2026. The Act will require app stores serving Texans to verify users’ ages and secure parental consent for minors’ downloads and purchases, and will impose related obligations on developers whose applications are offered through those stores, among other requirements.

Along with similar legislation in Utah and Louisiana, the Act signals a shift toward mobile app stores sharing responsibility with developers for minors’ online safety.

Below is a summary of the Act’s key provisions and the implications for businesses within its sweeping scope.

Scope

The Act imposes obligations on both app store owners and app developers that make applications available to Texas users.

App Stores include any publicly available Internet website, software application, or other electronic service that distributes software applications from the owner or developer of a software application to the user of a mobile device. There are no size or revenue thresholds, so even niche or non-traditional platforms may fall within the scope of the law.

App Developers are developers of software applications that are made available to users through an app store.

Key Requirements for App Stores

Age Verification and Categorization: When a Texas user creates an account, app stores must use a commercially reasonable method to determine the user’s age category, classifying them as a child (under 13), younger teenager (13–15), older teenager (16–17), or adult (18 or older). The Act, however, does not clarify what qualifies as a “commercially reasonable” method.

Transparency of Age Rating: App stores must display age ratings for every app. If the app store has not developed its own age-rating system, the store must display a developer-provided rating along with the content or features of the application that informed the rating. In all cases, the information must be clear, accurate, and conspicuous.

Parental Account Affiliation: For users under 18, the app store must link minors’ accounts to a parent or guardian account and use a commercially reasonable method to verify that the adult has legal authority over the minor.

Parental Consent:

Blanket approvals are not allowed; app stores must obtain a parent’s or guardian’s consent for each download or in-app purchase by a minor. Certain apps, such as those providing emergency services, are exempt.

In order to obtain consent, app stores must clearly disclose to parents or guardians: (i) the app or purchase at issue along with the app’s age rating, (ii) the elements that led to the age rating, (iii) personal data collected or used in connection with the app or purchase, and (iv) any measures the app developer has implemented to safeguard personal data.

If a developer makes material changes to its app, such as conducting new personal data processing activities, adding monetization functionality, adjusting age ratings, or making significant functional updates, the app store must secure updated consent from minors’ parents or guardians.

Transparency to Developers: App stores must allow developers to access, using a commercially available method, the age category assigned to each user and whether consent has been obtained. Additionally, app stores must notify developers if parents or guardians revoke consent. Notably, the Act contains a safe harbor for developers who rely in good faith on information received from the app store and have otherwise complied with the requirements of the Act.

Use of Personal Data: App stores must collect only the personal data necessary for age verification, parental consent, and records of compliance, and must transmit that data using industry-standard encryption.

Key Requirements for App Developers

App Rating Designation: Developers must assign age ratings for each app and purchase and clearly disclose the content or elements of the app or purchase that informed that rating.

Notice of Significant Changes: If a developer makes significant changes to the app, such as changing how or what personal data is collected or used, changing the rating assigned to the software application or the content or element that led to the rating, adding monetization features, or materially altering the functionality or user experience, they must notify the app store in order to allow the app store to notify minors’ parents and guardians and renew consent.

Developer Age Verification: Developers must implement a system to use information from the app store to verify the age category assigned to each user and confirm whether consent has been obtained for minors to download or make purchases within the app.

Use of Personal Data: App developers may only use personal data provided by the app stores pursuant to the Act to enforce age restrictions, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and implement safety features and default settings. Developers must delete such information once verification is complete.

Enforcement

Violations of the Act constitute deceptive trade practices under Texas’s Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which permits the Texas attorney general to seek injunctive relief and impose civil penalties, and also allows for consumer remedies.

Key Impacts

Broad and Ambiguous Application: Because the Act does not have any size or revenue thresholds for applicability, the Act’s broad definition of “app store” could capture platforms that do not consider themselves traditional app stores, including niche software distributors or download facilitators. These businesses may face operational difficulties in linking minor accounts to parents or guardians, communicating age and consent information to developers, and implementing age verification across their platforms.

Actual Knowledge of Minor Users: By requiring app stores to provide developers with information that their apps are being used by minors, the Act creates “actual knowledge” of minor usage. For apps intended for a general audience, this could trigger obligations under COPPA if personal information is collected from children under 13, or under teen privacy laws in other states that are triggered by having actual knowledge of users under 18.

Tension with Data Minimization Principles: The Act obligates app stores to collect and disclose, and developers to receive and confirm, personal data for age verification and parental consent requirements, information app stores and developers may not have otherwise collected. While the Act imposes a general data minimization guardrail, this mandate could still significantly expand data-processing activities, especially for functional apps such as weather or utility services, and may create friction with other state privacy laws that prioritize strict data minimization and short retention periods.

Outlook

Minor privacy and online safety laws nationwide are facing mounting constitutional challenges, including around age-verification provisions, and the Act has not been immune to these challenges. In October 2025, two lawsuits were filed challenging the Act. The first, brought by the advocacy group Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT), argues that the Act’s sweeping age-verification and parental-consent requirements for all app downloads and in-app purchases unlawfully impose a content-based prior restraint on speech, in violation of the First Amendment. The complaint contends that the law substitutes the state’s judgment for that of parents, undermining their ability to decide how much privacy and autonomy to grant their children online. Similarly, the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) asserts that protecting younger internet users should not come at the expense of free expression and personal privacy, as the Act restricts access to lawful content and places onerous verification and consent burdens on both parents and minors. However, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld Texas’s pornography age-verification law, which may indicate that Texas’s broader framework for regulating minors’ digital access could be better positioned to survive early challenges.

In light of this, app stores—and any business offering a mobile application—should begin preparing now to operationalize the Act’s technical requirements. At the same time, companies should carefully assess their privacy compliance strategies (particularly with respect to minors’ data) to minimize exposure, especially given the increased attention given to children’s online safety nationwide.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.78_1208.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:28.942610

""South Carolina’s future prosperity requires that we constantly work to create, innovate and improve our efforts in each of these endeavors. By thinking big, by being bold, and by making these transformative investments, I believe we will set our state on a course that will provide the opportunity for prosperity, success, and happiness for generations of South Carolinians.""

A copy of the governor's executive budget, along with his letter to the General Assembly and a detailed explanation of each allocation, can be found here, and a copy of a presentation outlining the governor's priorities can be found here.

The following executive budget highlights are attributable to Governor McMaster:

Executive Budget Highlights:

Over $1 Billion in New Money to Keep Road Projects Moving:

""We have made tremendous progress improving our roadways, with major projects under construction in every corner of the state. Currently there are almost $7 billion in active projects underway across the state, up from $2.7 billion in 2017. Much of that progress is a result of four years’ worth of state budget appropriations totaling $1.4 billion for new construction and improvements to state-owned roads, bridges, highways, and interstates.

""However, nationally and here in South Carolina, inflationary construction and labor cost increases now threaten to create crippling delays and busted budgets for major road construction projects currently underway and those soon to break ground.

""My Executive Budget recommends an appropriation of $1.1 billion in new surplus money to keep current and future construction projects moving and on schedule despite inflationary cost increases.""

Population Growth Study for the Future:

""In addition to inflation, South Carolina’s major infrastructure systems and essential government services are struggling to support and keep up with the explosive and unrestrained population growth happening across the state. Last year, the U-Haul rental company ranked South Carolina as the number one destination for their moving trucks and vans.

""Left unaddressed, the state may face future problems with water and sewer access, traffic congestion, road and bridge repair, demand for electric power generation, public safety, school overcrowding, and healthcare availability.

""The time has come, and we must start now, to conduct a thorough analysis and study to determine if our state’s infrastructure and government services will be able to keep pace if population growth continues unrestrained.

""This Executive Budget includes a proviso directing the Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs to issue a request for information (RFI) to identify the scope, expectations, and costs for developing one or more comprehensive analyses to measure the impacts of the 10 and 20-year projected population growth on South Carolina’s infrastructure and essential government services.""

Largest Rainy Day Savings Fund:

""South Carolina government currently maintains its largest rainy day reserve fund balance and low amounts of general obligation debt. In 2022-2023 my Executive Budget began recommending that we maintain a “rainy-day” fund balance of no less than 10% of the total General Fund revenues each year.

""To maintain that balance, I am recommending that a total of $1.4 billion be set aside and placed in the State’s “rainy day” fund. Saving money instead of spending it has served our state well – and ensures that we will always be prepared for future economic uncertainties.""

Keep Cutting the Income Tax:

""Until a few years ago, South Carolina had the highest personal income tax rate in the Southeast and the 12th highest in the nation. No more.

""Five years ago, I signed into law the largest income tax cut in state history. As a result, South Carolina taxpayers have kept an additional $1.275 billion of their hard-earned money. My Executive Budget continues to cut the state’s income tax an additional $107.2 million, by dropping the rate from 6% to 5.9%.

""And we don’t need to stop at 5.9% – we should continue cutting or eliminating the personal income tax rate as much as we can, and as fast as we can.""

New Teacher Pay - $50,500.00:

""Eight years ago, the minimum starting salary of a teacher in South Carolina was $30,113 and the average teacher salary was below the Southeastern average. At that time, I proposed that we begin raising the minimum starting teacher salary, as much as possible each year, with the goal of raising it to at least $50,000 by 2026.

""This year, my Executive Budget recommends spending $150 million of the budget surplus to continue raising the minimum starting teacher salary, going from $48,500 to $50,500. This represents a 68% increase since 2017. South Carolina’s required minimum starting teacher salary continues to exceed that of both Georgia and North Carolina.

""In addition, as the minimum salary for new teachers has risen, so has the average salary of a public school teacher in South Carolina, reaching $64,050 last year, which has exceeded the Southeastern average every year since 2021.""

Expanding Full-Day 4K:

""Since the statewide expansion of the full-day four-year-old kindergarten program (4K) starting in the 2021-2022 school year, enrollment in the program offered in public schools, private childcare centers, and private schools, has increased significantly.

""Today, 18,411 students are enrolled in the program, which is a 30% increase since the program was expanded. Currently, every public school district in the state, except one, is offering full-day four-year-old kindergarten for children from low-income households with an annual income that is at or below 150% of federal poverty guidelines.

""Enrollment has also grown at the private day cares, private schools and community head start providers participating in the program. According to the Office of First Steps to School Readiness (First Steps) there are currently 1,899 classroom slots available at these private providers.

""To fill these available classroom slots, this Executive Budget includes an appropriation of $9.9 million to the Office of First Steps to expand enrollment eligibility to children from households with an annual income that is at or below 300% of the federal poverty guidelines. As an example, a family of four with a household income of $96,450 would be eligible.""

Breakfast For Every Public School Student:

""Recently, the State of Arkansas began offering free breakfast to all public school students – regardless of household income. I propose that South Carolina do the same.

""Research studies have documented that children who eat breakfast daily are better prepared to learn in the classroom. Eating breakfast improves their cognitive performance, attention, memory, and behavior – thereby improving their academic performance.

""My Executive Budget recommends an appropriation of $8.7 million in new money, which the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA) estimates will fund 4.1 million meals, sufficient to provide a daily breakfast for every public school student in the state.""

Expanding School Choice:

""The Education Scholarship Trust Fund provides scholarships to eligible low-income parents so they can choose the type of education environment and instruction that best suits their child’s unique needs. Last year, the General Assembly increased the minimum number of scholarships required to be funded in this year’s state budget from 10,000 to 15,000. They placed no cap on the number of scholarships that may be funded above 15,000.

""Due to the popularity of the program, my Executive Budget recommends expanding the number of funded scholarships to 20,000 with an appropriation of $61.4 million in new money, which will also increase the scholarship award amount from $7,500 to $7,634.""

School Resource Officers in Every School:

""Placing an armed, certified school resource officer (SRO) in every school, in every county, all day, every day, has been one of my top priorities as governor. At my request, the General Assembly began funding a grant program administered by the Department of Public Safety, to provide school districts with funds to hire more resource officers for our state’s 1,283 public schools.

""The grant program has been very successful and has more than tripled the number of schools with an officer assigned to a school, going from 406 in 2018 to 1,181 in 2025.

""In last year’s budget, and at my request, the General Assembly provided the final full-funding necessary to place a full-time SRO in all 1,283 public schools statewide. While it is no longer necessary to request an appropriation of new money for the program, this Executive Budget maintains the current level of annual funding at $56.2 million.""

Freezing College Tuition:

""This year marks the seventh consecutive year that I will propose that we freeze college tuition for in-state students with an appropriation of $39.2 million. To receive funds from this appropriation, each institution is required to certify that there will be no in-state tuition or mandatory fee increase for the 2026-2027 academic year.""

College Maintenance and New Capital Projects:

""My Executive Budget recommends appropriating $81.7 million in one-time funds for deferred maintenance and critical capital building projects on the campuses of our public colleges and universities, and $40.3 million for the state’s technical college campuses.

""The formula used to calculate each school's appropriation is based on each school’s fall 2025 in-state enrollment reported to the Commission on Higher Education (CHE). Each college and university receives $1,000 for each in-state undergraduate student enrolled in the fall of 2025; the technical colleges $500.""

Increasing Need-Based Financial Aid:

""For the sixth year in a row, my Executive Budget proposes providing $80 million in state lottery funds for needs-based grants so that every South Carolinian who qualifies for financial aid – as measured by federal Pell Grants – has sufficient state financial assistance to attend any in-state public college, university, or technical college. Students at private, independent, and historically black colleges and universities will receive an additional $20 million for Tuition Grants and assistance as well.

""I am also recommending funding for a new needs-based college scholarship, the Meeting Street Scholarships, using $15 million in new one-time funds. These funds will help leverage private donations to provide a $10,000 annual college scholarship up-to four years, for academically prepared, Pell Grant eligible, in-state students to attend an eligible South Carolina college or university.""

Future of Higher Education Institutions Study:

""Once again, I will renew my call for the General Assembly to fund and authorize a systemic review of our state’s 33 public institutions of higher education, to be procured by the Department of Employment and Workforce. The goal is to make sure we are preparing to meet our state’s future workforce needs.

""This study will address the sustainability, accessibility, and affordability, as well as provide an assessment of the need for consolidation of existing physical space, programs, certificates, and degrees offered at our public colleges and universities, as compared to the projected workforce needs of our state in the future.""

Workforce Technical College Scholarships:

""To address the high demand for skills, training, and knowledge, this Executive Budget once again provides $95 million in lottery funds to South Carolina Workforce Industry Needs Scholarships (SC WINS) through the South Carolina Technical College System.

""This very successful program has provided over 120,000 South Carolinians with scholarships to cover the cost of tuition and required fees at any of our technical colleges to earn a post-secondary or industry credential in high-demand careers like manufacturing, nursing, computer science, information technology, transportation, logistics, or construction.""

MUSC Comprehensive Cancer Hospital:

""The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) estimates that South Carolina’s incidence of cancer rate for adults ages 18 and over will be 18% between 2023 and 2028, surpassing the national growth rate of 12%. And, over the next 15 years, cancer rates are projected to increase by 30%.

""This Executive Budget recommends $115 million for the creation of a new National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated Comprehensive Cancer Hospital at MUSC. With this important designation, MUSC will be able to deliver best-in-class cancer care and cutting-edge clinical trials for all South Carolinians, including those in rural and underserved communities.""

New Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities:

""In the last two years, we completed the most significant government restructuring and accountability effort in over thirty years – bringing direct gubernatorial accountability to the actions of our largest state healthcare service delivery agencies.

""The first step of our restructuring effort came two years ago, when the commission run Department of Health and Environmental Control was dissolved and was statutorily reconstituted as two new gubernatorial cabinet agencies – the Department of Public Health and the Department of Environmental Services.

""Then a year later, the commission run Department of Mental Health, and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs were dissolved and reconstituted, along with the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services, into a new gubernatorial cabinet agency, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities.

""My Executive Budget recommends that almost $100 million be appropriated to these new cabinet agencies as they work to improve and modernize access to healthcare delivery services for the South Carolinians who depend on them.""

Land Preservation and Conservation:

""Once again, my Executive Budget recommends that significant funds – $68 million – be appropriated to the Conservation Land Bank, the Department of Natural Resources, the Office of Resilience, and the Forestry Commission for the purposes of identifying and preserving culturally or environmentally significant or endangered properties, and also for flooding mitigation efforts.

""In addition, I am recommending the Conservation Land Bank receive $3 million for the purpose of awarding voluntary conservation easements to preserve working agricultural farms and forested land for future generations of farmers. To date, 1,650 acres have been preserved using these easements.""

Law Enforcement Pay Raises and New Officers:

""A few years ago, we tasked the South Carolina Department of Administration with conducting a comprehensive analysis of law enforcement pay within state government. This effort was aimed at ensuring salaries are competitive to attract and retain top-tier talent.

""As a result, and each year since, South Carolina's law enforcement officers have received substantial pay raises – some as high as 52% in the last three years. My Executive Budget continues our investment in our state law enforcement professionals by providing an additional $10.7 million for pay raises and for the hiring of new agents and officers.""

First Responder Income Tax Credit:

""I renew my call for the General Assembly to provide a $2,000 state income tax credit for every active-duty law enforcement officer, firefighter, first responder, and emergency medical technician employed by a public entity. This nonrefundable tax credit will provide a total of $45 million in income tax relief for those who put their lives on the line each day to protect and serve the public.""

Law Enforcement Grants for Sheriffs:

""This Executive Budget also creates a $35 million equipment grant program for our state’s 46 sheriffs, administered by the Department of Public Safety. To be eligible, the sheriff or a member of their command staff must have completed, be enrolled in, or attest to future enrollment in, the Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program at the University of South Carolina Law School.""

Department of Corrections:

""In addition, I recommend the Department of Corrections be appropriated $58.89 million for pay raises, new staff hires, deferred maintenance, inflationary operating costs, and technology upgrades at our state’s 21 prisons""

State Disaster Relief Program:

""Last year, in the wake of Hurricane Helene, I proposed that the General Assembly create and fund the South Carolina Public Assistance (PA) program to be administered by the South Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD). This grant program allows local governments, public utilities, nonprofit, and charitable aid organizations to apply for disaster recovery funds – funds that were either denied by the federal government or did not meet federal FEMA thresholds. This year, I am recommending the program receive an appropriation of $20 million in one-time funds.""",https://governor.sc.gov/themes/custom/governorpalmetto/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-12 17:01:37.670110

Analysts predict that the global market for 21700 lithium-ion batteries will continue to grow at a rapid pace, with compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) in the double digits over the next decade. The growth of this market is attributed to the vital role these batteries play in Energy Storage Systems (ESS), mobile medical devices, sophisticated tracking and security systems, and portable electronics. The industry’s growth trajectory is driven by continuous innovation, with a focus on enhanced safety features, faster charging capabilities, and tighter regulatory compliance. In this technologically demanding environment, the criteria for selecting a battery manufacturer have narrowed to focus on established production expertise and proven quality in 21700 lithium battery manufacturing.

Modern industrial landscapes are being fundamentally transformed by the need for portable, powerful, and sustainable energy storage. As electric vehicles (EVs), high-performance tools, and consumer electronics become more prevalent, the demand for batteries that offer high energy density alongside safety and reliability continues to surge. The 21700 cell is essential to the global push toward decarbonization and electrification.

21700: The Next Generation of Cylindrical Battery Technology

The 21700 cell (21mm diameter, 70.0mm length) is widely regarded as the “golden size” of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Originally pioneered by Tesla and Panasonic to break the energy density limitations of the legacy 18650 format, it has since become the benchmark for high-performance applications.

While the physical dimensions increase only slightly, the volume of a 21700 cell is approximately 47% greater than that of an 18650. This increase allows for a disproportionate boost in performance:

Capacity: While high-end 18650s max out around 3.5Ah, 21700 cells commonly offer 4.0Ah to 5.0Ah, with next-generation prototypes pushing toward 6.0Ah.

Energy Density: On a system level, 21700 packs typically offer a 20% increase in energy density. This means fewer cells are required to achieve the same range or runtime, reducing the overall footprint of the battery pack.

The transition to 21700 wasn’t just about making the “can” bigger; it involved a complete overhaul of internal chemistry and mechanical design:

Tabless & Multi-Tab Design: Many high-drain 21700 cells (like the Samsung 40T or 50S) utilize advanced tab designs to minimize Internal Resistance (IR). Lower resistance means less heat generation and the ability to sustain higher continuous discharge currents (often up to 35A-45A).

Silicon-Carbon Anodes: To maximize capacity, manufacturers are increasingly replacing traditional graphite anodes with Silicon-Carbon (Si-C) composites, which have a much higher theoretical energy storage capacity.

High-Nickel Cathodes: Most 21700 cells utilize NCM 811 (Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) or NCA (Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum) chemistries. The high nickel content increases energy but requires the superior thermal management that the 21700’s larger surface area provides.

The cylindrical lithium-ion market has undergone significant changes, and the 21700 battery is now the standard for high-drain applications.

Eight states cut income tax rates on Jan. 1, 2026. Nebraska’s top rate drops to 4.55 %. Indiana falls to 2.95 %, Ohio simplifies to 2.75 %. North Carolina reaches 3.99 %, Kentucky 3.5 %, and Montana 5.65 %. Oklahoma and Mississippi also lower rates. Residents keep more earnings. States aim to boost growth, attract workers, and investments.

New state income tax cuts took effect on Jan. 1, 2026, as eight U.S. states lowered their individual income tax rates to give working families and businesses more take‑home pay. These reductions, enacted by state legislatures and governors over the last several years, reflect ongoing efforts to make local economies more competitive and attract residents, talent and investment. The cuts come amid broader national tax debates, including federal policy changes and rising state budget pressures.

Across the eight states, top marginal and flat tax rates fell by meaningful margins, offering residents immediate financial relief as they begin the new tax year. Tax policy experts say these changes could boost consumer spending and economic growth, while critics caution that revenue losses may strain public services if long‑term budget planning is weak. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank tracking state tax policy changes, reports all eight cuts went into effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

These state tax cuts are part of a broader pattern of tax reform across the U.S., which also includes discussions at the federal level about potential changes to deductions and tax brackets scheduled to shift in coming years. As Americans adjust to new tax rules in 2026, many may see a tangible increase in their paychecks or tax refunds. Recent financial analysis also shows some households could see larger refunds due to changes in federal SALT (state and local tax) deduction rules.

States with lower income tax rates in 2026

The following states reduced their individual income tax rates effective Jan. 1, 2026. These cuts vary by tax structure, from flat rates to top marginal brackets:

Indiana: The state’s flat tax rate dropped from 3.00 % in 2025 to 2.95 % in 2026. Indiana lawmakers also approved future reductions, including lowering the rate further to 2.90 % on Jan. 1, 2027, and a potential goal of 2.55 % in even‑numbered years starting in 2030 if revenue targets are met.

Kentucky: The flat rate fell to 3.5 % from 4.0 %, representing the largest percentage drop among these states.

Mississippi: Continued its scheduled multi‑year phase‑down, reducing its flat rate to 4.0 % from 4.4 %.

Montana: Its top marginal rate decreased to 5.65 % from 5.9 %, while its lower bracket remains 4.7 % but now applies over a wider income range.

Nebraska: The top rate dropped to 4.55 % from 5.2 % as part of a planned phase‑down that aims to reach around 3.99 % by 2027.

North Carolina: Continued down its long‑term tax plan with the flat rate now at 3.99 %, from 4.25 %, marking the final scheduled cut in this multi‑year process.

Ohio: Adopted a flat tax of 2.75 % on income above $26,050, with no tax on income below that threshold — dramatically simplifying the rate structure.

Oklahoma: Reduced its top rate to 4.5 % from 4.75 % and consolidated six tax brackets into three broader brackets.

These rate changes mean residents in those states can expect to pay less in income taxes for the 2026 tax year. For example, a Nebraska resident who previously paid the 5.2 % top rate will now have more disposable income each pay period or when filing in 2027. Similarly, Ohio’s flat tax simplification could benefit middle‑income earners who previously faced a more complex rate schedule.

Live Events

Tax Foundation data show that these changes reflect a broader shift toward lower rates and less progressive tax structures. Flat tax systems — which many of these states embrace — aim to provide simplicity and certainty for taxpayers. However, some tax analysts raise potential concerns about budget shortfalls if states don’t appropriately plan for reduced revenue streams.

Why states are cutting income taxes

State leaders argue that income tax cuts can boost economic growth, attract workers, and support small businesses. Lower rates may encourage consumer spending, increase job creation, and make states more attractive for relocation. In an era when many companies are choosing where to expand or relocate, tax competitiveness has become a factor in economic development strategies.

Proponents say that when residents keep more of their earnings, they are more likely to spend locally, invest, or save — injecting more activity into state economies. For employers, lower personal tax rates can support recruitment and retention of talent.

Critics of rapid tax rate reductions warn that cuts could reduce crucial revenue for public services, including education, infrastructure and health programs. They argue that without careful budget planning — especially in states with unpredictable revenue cycles — tax cuts might force cuts to essential services or future tax hikes.

FAQs:

Q: Which states cut income tax rates on January 1, 2026, and by how much?

A: Eight states lowered their income tax rates effective Jan. 1, 2026. Indiana’s flat rate fell to 2.95 %, Kentucky to 3.5 %, Mississippi to 4 %, Montana’s top rate dropped to 5.65 %, Nebraska’s top rate fell to 4.55 %, North Carolina to 3.99 %, Ohio simplified to a flat 2.75 %, and Oklahoma reduced its top rate to 4.5 %.

Q: How will these state income tax cuts affect residents and economic growth?

A: Residents will see more take-home pay and smaller state tax bills in 2026. States expect the cuts to encourage consumer spending, attract workers, and boost business investment. Some states, like Indiana and Nebraska, have multi-year reduction plans, while Ohio simplified brackets to make taxation more transparent and predictable for taxpayers.

So, the data acquisition and the optionality are the key.” “The scenario planning is the easy part.","Manufacturers can adapt their preparations to address the risks and opportunities being driven by federal policy. For some manufacturers, the top issue is the ongoing concern about workforce.

Workforce alternatives

“Even if you don’t have undocumented workers, you might have someone with a family member that is,” Schindler said. “So, they might not show up to work one day because they’re fearful for their family member or they’re taking care of them.” She said that some companies are setting up HR programs to help proactively identify and address these potential issues.

Another way to mitigate workforce shortages is to look at recruitment from non-traditional sources. This approach might also require restructuring shifts or work. “Stay-at-home parents might be available while they have kids in school, or you might need to look at other types of workers that you didn’t before.”

Eaton agreed, “I believe that you’re going to have fewer workers, so the people who would have had a hard time getting a job could become a pool of resources.” For instance, he noted, there are federal programs to help employers consider hiring formerly incarcerated workers:

Pathway Home Grants: In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor committed $25 million for pre‑release training and employment services to help people transition to connect incarcerated adults with apprenticeships, occupational training, and legal assistance before their release.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC): This is a federal tax credit of up to $9,600 per hire, for businesses employing eligible ex-offenders.

Second Chance Act: This is a federal law administered by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, providing grants to organizations that support job training, placement and education for people leaving incarceration.

Reentry Employment Opportunities: This is a U.S. Department of Labor initiative (under WIOA Section 169), funding state and local programs that test employment strategies for justice‑involved adults and youth.

Automotive: Workforce alternatives and development is an area where the automotive sector has provided leading examples of what can be done. Manufacturers in other sectors have looked to automakers for strategies that can help overcome workforce issues.

One workforce alternative that always generates discussion is automation — and OBBBA provides some incentives for tech modernization, but effective automation requires an effective strategy. “Then, you should also look at up-]skilling workers to take higher-responsibility roles as automation or AI agents take lower-responsibility roles,” Schindler said.

As manufacturers consider which strategies will enable them to capitalize on current opportunities and mitigate potential risks, whether workforces-related or otherwise, they can improve the clarity and accuracy of their planning with scenario modeling. However, effective scenario modeling can be difficult. “As you’re trying to figure out what all of your options are, you also need to determine how to model them in a way that gives you a good answer,” Eaton said. “It has to be defined the right way.”

Effective scenario modeling

The recent changes in federal policy provide an excellent reason to use scenario modeling — but they’re not the only reason. “People are already modeling,” Eaton said, “and some have been doing it for a long time.” Yet, the exercise is not always effective.

“There are a lot of leaders who feel like they’re doing scenario modeling, but they’re not getting the most out of it, or maybe they’re not doing it right,” Schindler said. “At a recent conference, there was a whole session on why scenario planning fails: The biggest reason is that people do the scenario modeling, but then they’re afraid to act on it.” This hesitation is often caused by a lack of confidence in the results.

To get the right results from your scenario models, you need the right options and inputs.

“Any talented analytical person can build the model or scenario. It’s knowing how to define scenarios and what’s an option or what’s not,” Eaton said. “The issue is that nobody’s model is the same. Even if you’re solving for the same outcome, the inputs into the model are different. So, the data acquisition and the optionality are the key.”

“The scenario planning is the easy part. It’s actually defining the scenarios the right way and understanding the optionality — that’s where the gold’s at.”

Eaton outlined how some companies could create scenarios for choosing suppliers that don’t incur tariffs, or that allow them to take other actions in response to evolving federal policies — if they understand those options and how to capture them. “Your model has to be defined the right way. The scenario planning is the easy part. It’s actually defining the scenarios the right way and understanding the optionality — that’s where the gold’s at.”

Eaton outlined some fundamental steps to analyze your business and build an effective model for trade and tariff issues:

Map your supply chain: “The first step is to map the supply chain operating model and understand, from a physical perspective, where your operations are, where your suppliers are and how that impacts you from a trade perspective,” Eaton said.

Identify your options: “Think through the optionality to address the impact of tariffs, if that’s the biggest issue,” Eaton said. “I actually think the bigger issues are often the other unmitigated risks that impact suppliers. Many companies need to have a better understanding of where the inputs into the products that they manufacture are coming from.”

Examine regulations: “Once you understand the risk factors within your supply chain network, and where your exposure is from a trade and tariff perspective, then you can overlay the regulatory aspect,” Eaton said. It’s important for your model to help you understand when regulatory restrictions do or don’t affect potential decisions.

Financial reconciliation: “Then, there’s the financial reconciliation,” Eaton said. “That includes what may or may not make sense from a tax perspective or from a strategic business continuity perspective.”

To manage shifting tariff impacts while weighing the opportunities presented by OBBBA tax incentives, manufacturers need to optimize their decisions with a range of factors.

This diagram shows that a tax-effective supply chain planning scenario model needs to consider factors from three areas:

Strategic planning

Operational and financial planning

Tax planning

The strategic planning factors include:

Growth strategy and scalability requirements

Risk to supply chain operating model

End-to-end physical supply chain networks

The operational and financial planning factors include:

Intersection of customer segments and SKU performance

Intrinsic supply chain cost to serve trend

Cash conversion cycle

The tax planning factors include:

Tax strategy and methods

Transfer pricing

Trade and tariff implications

State and local tax incentives

With effective and accurate scenario models, manufacturers can adapt their decisions for emerging issues or even review decisions they’ve already made.

“How do you look at trading partners and make sure that the people you’re working with are the best for you?” Eaton asked. “How do you look at your operating model and determine if this is really the only location that you can produce a product, or if you would be better served to produce it elsewhere? Would you be better served to look at making versus buying — or to not make some products at all, just buy a finished good and resell it?”

These questions could have important answers for your business, but the inputs are complex and unique.

“It’s a matter of looking at the dimensions that affect your decisions and coming to a reconciliation of the outcome,” Eaton said. “That’s something that people have to realize: There isn’t an off-the-shelf answer.”

The officials blame the oil companies for environmental damage to the Louisiana coast from decades of oil and gas production.
Federal court is seen as a friendlier venue for the oil companies.
Although that company had withdrawn from the Supreme Court petition, it remained a party in federal court, according to a letter from the court clerk.
The oil companies argue the law applies in this matter because of World War II-era fuel-supply contracts.","The Supreme Court justices on Monday heard arguments in a lawsuit seeking to hold oil companies liable for environmental damage to Louisiana’s coastline.

The argument focused on a narrow question — whether the oil companies can remove cases over the damage from state to federal court — but the stakes are high.

Local officials in Louisiana have filed more than 40 related lawsuits seeking potentially billions of dollars in damages. The officials blame the oil companies for environmental damage to the Louisiana coast from decades of oil and gas production. They argue that the companies engaged in illegal activity, by drilling, dredging and engaging in waste disposal without proper permits. Those actions, state officials argue, have contributed to extensive coastal erosion.

Federal court is seen as a friendlier venue for the oil companies. If the justices allow the companies to move their cases there, it could have implications for other climate change-related lawsuits. Such lawsuits have increased in recent years as states and local governments face increasing challenges with how to pay for environmental damage. Oil companies have argued they pose a threat to the country’s energy security.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh pressed the lawyer for a coalition of major oil companies, Paul D. Clement, about why they have sought to move the lawsuits out of state courts in local parishes, which are similar to counties.

“There seems to be a concern about the fairness of the state court system that underlies your position in this case,” Justice Kavanaugh said. “What is that concern?”

Mr. Clement responded that a judgment issued in federal court would be more broadly accepted. If the plaintiffs can prove their case in federal court, then “everybody’s going to accept the outcome” and the decision would not be viewed “as something that’s a product of local prejudice.”

He cited examples where national policies have been locally unpopular, making it potentially difficult for the companies to get a fair trial with a local jury. Last April, a jury in Plaquemines Parish, the state’s southernmost parish, found Chevron Corporation liable for about $745 million for damage to the state’s coastal wetlands.

Lawyers for Louisiana have fought to keep the cases in state courts.

Louisiana’s solicitor general, J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, said state courts were best suited to judge whether the underlying law, a Louisiana environmental statute, had been violated.

“We have the same reasons for wanting to be in state court that anybody who sues under state law wants to be in state court,” Mr. Aguiñaga told the justices. “We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get to the Louisiana Supreme Court on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope.”

The argument, which lasted more than an hour, was muted. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who is often active in arguments and typically asks lively hypotheticals, recused himself from the case just days before the argument. He cited his financial ties to one of the companies involved in the dispute, ConocoPhillips, the parent corporation of Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company. Although that company had withdrawn from the Supreme Court petition, it remained a party in federal court, according to a letter from the court clerk.

The question of whether the oil companies can successfully get the cases into federal court hinges on what’s known as the federal officer removal statute. This law gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil cases that concern the actions of federal officials or those acting under the orders of a federal official.

The oil companies argue the law applies in this matter because of World War II-era fuel-supply contracts. The Trump administration has joined the case in support of the oil companies.

A federal trial court rejected the companies’ argument, finding that they had failed to show their oil removal was done under the orders of a federal officer.

A divided panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit then upheld the lower court’s decision, blocking the companies from moving cases to federal court.

Unlike the trial court, the judges found that the oil companies had been operating under federal officials at the time of the World War II oil extraction. But a majority concluded that the oil companies failed to show that actions the jury said caused environmental damage were related to the company’s World War II-era fuel contracts.

Mr. Aguiñaga urged the justices to uphold that decision. He asserted that it was “an easy case,” that the oil companies had “dumped billions of gallons of produced water from oil wells directly into our marsh” and that it was “a massive deal for the state of Louisiana.”

Mr. Clement pushed back aggressively on this idea, telling the justices that it was clear the oil companies had worked in support of the country’s war, both on the battlefield and on “the home front.”

He called the war context of the oil company contracts “critical,” adding that the companies were fueling munitions factories, among other industries.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12dc-scotus-oil-lkwg/12dc-scotus-oil-lkwg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:01:52.361524

Denver, CO — On Friday, the EPA disapproved Colorado’s Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, again illegally undermining the state’s efforts to rein in pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources. The state’s plan includes retirement deadlines for coal plants that several utilities voluntarily proposed and asked the state to include in its plan. The plan was broadly supported by the state, utilities, industry, and environmental groups. Yet the Trump administration has once again tried to override decisions made by local utilities.

Under the Clean Air Act and federal Regional Haze Rule, states must reduce air pollution and improve air quality in national parks and wilderness areas. Regional haze plans also provide crucial health benefits for communities. In its disapproval of Colorado’s plan, the EPA claims the voluntary coal plant retirements included in the state’s plan would harm grid reliability, but this is incorrect because the state and the utilities have long planned to retire the coal plants and to replace their generation with cheaper and cleaner resources. EPA initially proposed a partial disapproval of Colorado’s haze plan, but the final rule released rejects the entire plan. Colorado’s plan fully complies with the Clean Air Act. EPA’s overreach in disapproving the plan is unwarranted and will harm Coloradans and result in dirtier air in Rocky Mountain National Park and other treasured public lands.

This news follows a recent illegal 202© order from the Department of Energy to prevent the planned retirement of Unit 1 at Craig Station. The order threatens to raise ratepayers’ utility bills and worsen air quality for surrounding communities. According to an analysis by Grid Strategies, if the plant is dispatched at its average output over the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, equating to approximately $85 million per year, or even upwards of $150 million per year if the plant is required to operate in must-run fashion.

“This is yet another unwarranted attempt by the Trump administration to prevent the long-planned retirements of Colorado’s expensive, dirty, and unreliable coal plants,” said Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney at Earthjustice. “The Trump administration’s ideological attacks on Colorado’s energy policies are illegal and will increase costs for customers, as clean energy in Colorado is far cheaper than coal.”

“EPA’s decision to disapprove Colorado’s plan is dangerous for Colorado’s national parks and for everyone who values clean, healthy air,” said Tracy Coppola, Colorado senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Millions of people visit our parks each year to experience the once-in-a-lifetime views, but pollution from coal plants continues to threaten the experience at Rocky Mountain, Great Sand Dunes and Black Canyon. Coloradans deserve a plan that protects the places we love for future generations. Dirty air is not the legacy we want to leave behind.”

“Trump’s attempts to prevent utilities from retiring uneconomic coal plants will increase electricity prices and deadly air pollution,” said Margaret Kran-Annexstein, director of the Colorado Chapter of the Sierra Club. “The EPA has abandoned its environmental mission in favor of propping up the dying coal industry. Utilities voluntarily decided to retire aging coal plants in Colorado because it would save customers money and reduce pollution, and EPA has no business overriding these local and state decisions.”

· Completed concept studies for expansion of South Carolina and Nevada hubs, increasing total HyProMag USA magnet and alloy production from 1,552 metric tons NdFeB to 4,656 metric tons NdFeB per annum, supporting scalable U.S. manufacturing strategy and reinforcing momentum towards a planned U.S. public listing

· Greater than $2 billion post-tax NPV and 38.7% real IRR for expanded developments, based on forecast market prices[i], support commencement of pre-feasibility studies for the expansions

London / Vancouver: 12 January 2026 - Mkango Resources Ltd (AIM / TSX-V:MKA) (the ""Company"" or ""Mkango"") is pleased to announce an update from HyProMag USA, LLC (""HyProMag USA"") on the completion of expansion concept studies (the ""Expansion Concept Study"") and the commencement of pre-feasibility studies for HyProMag USA's Plants located in South Carolina and Nevada, marking a significant step toward tripling its domestic manufacturing capacity by 2029. The studies support HyProMag USA's strategy to build a scalable platform across the U.S. for recycled neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets and reinforce the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. public listing.

The basis of the expansion studies is the recently completed Class 2 AACE[ii] capital cost estimate as part of the Detailed Engineering Design and Value Engineering Phase (the ""Detailed Design"") of the Company's first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denton County, Texas (the ""Texas Hub"" or the ""Project"").[iii]

The Texas Hub 2025 Detailed Design base case was based on operating three Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scrap (""HPMS"") vessels, with a post-tax Net Present Value (""NPV"") applying a 7% discount rate of $409 million based on current market prices, and a post-tax NPV of $780 million based on forecast prices.

The pre-feasibility studies for each of the South Carolina and Nevada hubs will focus on site selection, saleable products and Project configuration, optimal site layout, permitting, logistics, and technical marketing.

Key Highlights of the Expansion Concept Study

· Expansion targets increase magnet and NdFeB Alloy Powder Production capacity by 3x from 1,552 metric tons NdFeB to 4,656 metric tons NdFeB by 2029 across three hubs, in Texas, South Carolina, and Nevada.

· Concept Study focused on the development of modular production systems and evaluated three investment scenarios based on the following modular configurations:

o Case 1 - NdFeB Alloy Powder Production (HPMS[iv] only) - (Module 1)

o Case 2 - NdFeB Alloy Powder Production + Sintered Block Production (Modules 1 & 2)

o Case 3 - Fully Integrated Production: NdFeB Alloy Powder Production + Sintered Block + Magnet Finishing and Packaging (Modules 1, 2 and 3)

· Each site was envisioned as a brownfield development with no space or utility constraints, enabling optimized layouts and flexible future expansions

· The studies included conceptual building layouts, building options, environmental and permitting Roadmaps, Capital Cost Estimate (Class 4 AACE), and the basis of estimate

· Project schedule assumes the commissioning of three Plants between 2027 and 2029 and does not include an expansion of the Texas Hub

· Conceptual valuation: Concept study results for rare earth magnet recycling and manufacturing operations in the United States with a Texas Hub supported by two additional hubs (Case 3) co-located with Intelligent Lifecycle Solution (""ILS"") sites in South Carolina and Nevada[v]:

o $1,143 million post-tax NPV[vi] and 27.6% real internal rate of return (IRR) based on current market prices[vii],[viii]

o $2,180 million post-tax NPV and 38.7% real IRR based on forecast market prices[ix]

· Increased magnet production capacity: 2,823 metric tons per annum of recycled sintered neodymium-iron-boron (""NdFeB"") magnets and 1,833 metric tons per annum of associated NdFeB co-products (total payable capacity - 4,656 metric tons NdFeB) over a 40-year operating life from 2029.

· Pre-feasibility study magnet optimization expected to increase higher value sintered block production

· Industrial and workforce impact: The Plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create circa 300 skilled magnet manufacturing jobs

· Feedstock security: Plants in South Carolina and Nevada are co-located with ILS[x] facilities, expansions would be conditional on securing adequate feedstock and offtake

· Carbon profile: Independent ISO-compliant study for the Texas Hub 2024 feasibility study confirmed a very low-carbon footprint of 2.35 kg CO2-eq per kg of NdFeB sintered block product [xi]

· Scoping Studies: led by PegasusTSI Inc. (U.S.) and BBA USA Inc. (Canada), with support from HyProMag's international teams and the University of Birmingham

Building Momentum Toward U.S. Commercial Scale

The Expansion Concept Study build on a series of recent milestones for HyProMag USA, including detailed engineering and feasibility work on the Texas Hub, execution of the site lease[xii] at the Ironhead Commerce Center, and the Company's intention to pursue a U.S. public listing. Together these developments reflect accelerating momentum as HyProMag USA advances toward commercial operations and a scaled, manufacturing footprint across the U.S.

In parallel, HyProMag USA is engaging with large technology and infrastructure operators to support the growing need for secure, domestic recycling solutions for magnet-bearing equipment used in hyperscale data centers and AI infrastructure. The Company's modular, low carbon, magnet-to-magnet recycling platform is designed to support end-of-life recovery of rare earth materials from servers, storage systems, and related equipment, positioning HyProMag USA as a preferred long-term recycling and manufacturing partner for hyperscale customers as capacity expands in the United States.

Julian Treger, CoTec CEO commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA's Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform. The modular design allows us to replicate capacity efficiently, optimize products for U.S. customers, and accelerate domestic supply chain resilience. With the commissioning of HyProMag plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, along with recent progress on the Texas Hub, materially strengthens HyProMag USA's readiness for the next phase of growth and capital markets engagement.""

Will Dawes, Mkango CEO commented: ""HyProMag USA continues to develop a strong platform for further growth in the United States, and the recently completed Expansion Concept Study further validates the Company's business model and strategic positioning. In parallel with commissioning of the plants in UK and Germany, HyProMag USA is progressing rapidly towards first production in 2027, making a significant contribution to development of robust rare earth supply chains globally.""

The website was the primary hub for the DoE’s PR100 study, as the Department has invested over two years, and millions of dollars, into PR100 to develop strategies to fulfill its mandated goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050. This goal was established because Puerto Rico’s electrical system has historically been documented to have reliability challenges with worsening outage metrics, reaching levels significantly worse than the U.S. average.

“PR100 is part of an important initiative to help transition the archipelago from a grid facing high costs and significant operational difficulties to a more affordable and resilient clean energy system that can deliver energy security to the people of Puerto Rico,” the lawmaker wrote. “The website was crucial for the study to succeed by providing direct public access to the study, including summaries and raw data. The removal of the website diminishes the study’s ability to help guide federal and local efforts to support Puerto Rico’s renewable energy goals.”

The letter notes that the Department of Energy has also recently canceled billions of dollars in Puerto Rican renewable energy infrastructure project funding and loans, which is impacting planned transition efforts. The removal of the PR100 website complicates the DoE’s original mission to ensure America’s security and prosperity by addressing energy and environmental challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.

The letter concludes with a request that the website be reinstated no later than February 12, 2026.

In addition to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, the letter was cosigned by Representatives Brendan Boyle (PA-02), André Carson (IN-07), Ed Case (HI-01), Sean Casten (IL-06), Judy Chu (CA-28), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), Daniel Goldman (NY-10), Pablo Hernández (D-PR), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Ted Lieu (CA-36), Grace Meng (NY-06), Jerrold Nadler (NY-12), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), Mark Takano (CA-39), Ritchie Torres (NY-15), and Nydia Velázquez (NY-07).

,American Energy,2026-01-12 18:59:55+00:00,Institute for Local Self-Reliance,Why Climate Advocates Should Pounce on Utility Profits | Energy Democracy - ILSR,John Farrell,,,,,https://ilsr.org/article/energy-democracy/why-climate-advocates-should-pounce-on-utility-profits,"Climate leaders can revitalize the movement by rallying against excessive utility profits and showing how climate-friendly, local clean energy policies can bring relief to the millions of Americans struggling to pay their bills.
As a result, polluting coal and methane gas power plants stay online longer, accelerating climate change and further burdening consumers with costly power bills.
Georgia utility regulatory staff noted that the planned gas plant buildout would double the utility’s “ratebase,” sharply increasing utility bills across the board.
In other words, cutting utility profits unlocks more opportunity for community-owned clean energy resources that lower bills and build wealth.
Even amid backsliding at the federal level, the climate movement can make real progress in states and localities by targeting excessive utility profits and promoting non-utility clean energy.","Doused by illegal federal actions and swamped by a mounting affordability crisis, the climate movement can re-ignite by targeting for-profit utilities. Many in the climate movement have been demoralized by the Trump administration’s evisceration of the Inflation Reduction Act. Inflation, tariffs, and data centers have put climate concerns in the back seat to affordability among political leaders and ordinary Americans. Meanwhile, utility companies have clung to slow, expensive fossil fuel infrastructure that pads their bottom line, rather than making fast and affordable clean energy investments. Climate leaders can revitalize the movement by rallying against excessive utility profits and showing how climate-friendly, local clean energy policies can bring relief to the millions of Americans struggling to pay their bills.

Utilities have earned the opportunity to be villains. While delivering an essential public service, for-profit electric utilities make billions of dollars per year from inflated profits alone. Multiple studies suggest that the average American household, given no choice over the utility that delivers their electricity, pays nearly $300 extra per year to pad the wallets of utility shareholders. This pain disproportionately falls on historically marginalized communities and low-income households. Utilities pour these ill-gotten gains into political donations, advertising, and lavish retreats to forestall any serious accountability from state utility regulators.

Utilities have also delayed the energy transition by using their monopoly over the grid to hinder clean energy deployment. Utilities block grid connections for community solar, lobby to cut compensation for rooftop solar, and deliberately avoid building new power lines to connect affordable clean energy that might harm their own bottom line. As a result, polluting coal and methane gas power plants stay online longer, accelerating climate change and further burdening consumers with costly power bills.

Utilities have seized upon data centers to double down on their love for costly fossil fuels and the attendant profits. Georgia Power, for example, told regulators they need to build numerous new methane gas-fired power plants to meet a utility-projected 10,000 megawatts of new capacity. With a lifetime of 40 years or more, the plants would burden the atmosphere and utility customers with volatile prices and high costs for decades. They’d also enrich the utility, which makes an excessive profit on top of the cost of building new power plants and other infrastructure — even when other measures like energy efficiency would cost ratepayers less. Georgia utility regulatory staff noted that the planned gas plant buildout would double the utility’s “ratebase,” sharply increasing utility bills across the board. Like all for-profit utilities, Georgia Power’s excessive profit rate gives it a strong bias to build, build, build (mostly dirty energy).

Slaying the utility profit monster lowers bills and opens the door to many more affordable, emission-reducing solutions. Obviously, lower profits paid to utility shareholders means lower bills. Additionally, curtailing excessive profit margins for building new stuff also means that utilities have a reduced incentive to do so — and to block energy efficiency, independently owned clean energy, and other climate-friendly measures that don’t make them money. In other words, cutting utility profits unlocks more opportunity for community-owned clean energy resources that lower bills and build wealth.

Marrying affordability and climate means switching from utility-owned fossil fueled power plants to independently owned clean ones. Policies like distributed power plants, for example, explicitly pay consumers and entrepreneurs fair value for meeting the needs of the grid. Laws enabling community solar and plug-in solar can ensure that people who don’t own a sunny rooftop can still transition to clean energy while reducing their bills. All of these policies reduce the utility ratebase, which puts additional downward pressure on electricity bills. But as long as utilities make double-digit profits on fossil fuel infrastructure investments, they’ll have the incentive, power, and money to stymie these urgently-needed policy shifts.

Utilities have never been friends in the fight against climate change, nor champions of affordability. Even amid backsliding at the federal level, the climate movement can make real progress in states and localities by targeting excessive utility profits and promoting non-utility clean energy.",https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-markusspiske-2559749-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 17:13:40.265300

After the Department of the Interior transmitted Public Land Order 7917 to Congress, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN) announced plans to introduce a CRA resolution to overturn the 2023 mining ban. If successful, the effort would not only reverse this specific withdrawal but would also establish that Public Land Orders are subject to congressional review — curbing similar executive actions issued without congressional oversight in the future.

“This constitutes a positive, major shift in policy and a potential breakthrough for miners, rural communities, and anyone affected by the regulatory ‘ping-pong’ on federal lands,” said Pacific Legal Foundation Federal Policy Director Joe Luppino-Esposito. “Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply. When executive actions can shut down lawful exploration overnight, it weakens investment, domestic production, and our ability to secure critical resources at home.”

Pacific Legal Foundation has been actively advancing the legal theory underlying this move, engaging the White House, the Department of the Interior, and members of Congress to argue that Public Land Orders constitute rules and must be submitted under the CRA. No prior administration has taken this step.

The Stauber resolution opens the door for Congress to review — and potentially overturn — not just one Public Land Order, but all such executive land withdrawals. Once a CRA disapproval is issued, the rule cannot be reissued in substantially similar form by the executive, thereby providing long-needed certainty for miners and land users. Similar restrictions could be instituted only with congressional action.

She is the fifth generation of her family to live in this white clapboard house in Modeste facing the grassy Mississippi River levee. She sleeps in the same room her grandfather grew up in, shaded by sprawling oak trees, and spends her spare time rescuing dogs with her mom. Her grandmother is legendary environmental justice advocate Sharon Lavigne.

“We take care of each other down here,” Makaelyn Lavigne said on a recent afternoon, as she sat on a bench at the Modeste playground, sugar cane fields stretching away behind her. Her memories are of a community built around families and nature: “My grandpa dug a pond for us when we were younger so we could fish. We go tracking bobcats in the woods. They have eagles that nest across the river.”

Today, eagles above Modeste fly through some of the country’s most polluted air. Unprecedented petrochemical buildouts have changed Lavigne’s paradise. Her grandmother, Sharon Lavigne, a retired schoolteacher, has garnered worldwide attention with her ongoing battles against companies like Formosa and CF Industries. But the Lavigne family – and hundreds of others in Modeste – may soon be forced to leave their homes as petrochemical companies push to build a massive multi-corporation chemical industrial park that could turn Ascension into “Ammonia Parish.”

The targeted stretch of land abuts neighborhoods and homes like the Lavigne’s. To clear the way for the project, called the RiverPlex MegaPark, companies eyeing the development have begun to hire real estate firms. The firms have already made buyout offers to some residents, including Ashley Gaignard, a resident of Ascension Parish and campaigner with Rural Roots, who described them as low-ball offers.

But in October, Gaignard found a way to throw up some roadblocks in the march towards industrial development. Rural Roots is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit – inspired by a Caddo Parish lawsuit by Attorney General Liz Murrill herself. It challenges whether a parish council’s votes are legal if members do not vocally vote aloud.

Gaignard is trying to block the rezoning that allowed this massive industrial expansion in Ascension Parish. But four firms have already drawn up proposals for the Modeste buyout, while road crews are creating access roads for some facilities that begin construction next year. Besides Gaignard and her lawsuit, the only thing standing in the way of the MegaPark now are locals: residents here own some of the land surrounding the large-scale development.

If the widespread buyout moves forward as planned, it stands to change life here forever: it could essentially destroy Modeste and part of nearby Donaldsonville, displacing up to 800 residents. “It’s just very disheartening to see how they’re so willing to displace an entire community,” Lavigne said.

Ascension Parish Council did not respond to emailed questions about the buyout plan.

Residents are left faced with an impossible choice: those who refuse the buyout could be surrounded by industry belching harmful ammonia.

Ascension ranks high in the nation for air pollution

Ascension Parish sits in “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and New Orleans that’s home to a high concentration of petrochemical sites and carcinogenic pollution. The parish is among the top 10 counties in the country for air pollution: the CF Industries plant in Donaldsonville is the nation’s single largest toxic air polluter by pound, averaging more than a dozen unauthorized discharges per year.

Just upriver from Donaldsonville sits Modeste: a small but historically important unincorporated community, surrounded by sugarcane fields and agricultural land.

Centuries ago, the community was home to the plantation Babin Place, which in 1911 was purchased by a Black benevolent society that renamed it New Africa Farm. The society opened rural schools for children around Modeste. Later still, the farm was the home of Leonard Julien Sr., the Black inventor of the sugarcane-planting machine.

Now, said Lavigne, the town of Modeste is home to many grandparents, mostly Black and working-class people. As with many rural areas across the nation, young people often leave town in the face of dwindling job opportunities, leaving behind villages that are mostly made up of elders, who yearn for a local job market that could once again sustain their kids and grandkids, instead of the depressed agricultural economy.

Those realities can make it tough for places like Ascension Parish to fend off industry – even if it comes with waves of new pollution, potential leaks, and explosions.

Modeste faces its own hurdles. As an incorporated community, its voters did not get a say in the election of Donaldsonville Mayor Leroy Sullivan, one of the key boosters of the new industrial park.

Like the entire Ascension Parish Council, Sullivan supports the new development. The promised economic boom is the draw for him, though he is clearly aware of the dangers, as a survivor of a 2000 explosion at the Donaldsonville CF Industries plant that killed a contractor. Burned across most of his body, Sullivan spent 37 days recovering in a burn unit. His hands, Lavigne said, still bear the scars.

Gaignard doesn’t understand how any Ascension Parish leaders entrusted to protect their residents can open the door for the industrial park. “The same people that you went knocking on their door for a vote, these are the same people now saying, ‘You got to move. You have to go. We don’t have a place for you to go. All we know is you need to go,’” she said.

Ascension Parish plans to build the sprawling RiverPlex MegaPark industrial expansion across 17,000 acres. When completed, Modeste will be surrounded by heavy industry. Ammonia production in the area could more than quadruple.

Ultimately, it’s a choice between leaving a cherished community and living next to what could be Cancer Alley’s densest source of pollution yet. “They’re telling people it’s a choice, right? ‘If you want to go,’” Gaignard said. “But we all know it’s not safe to live that close to three industries being right on the next side of your fence.”

Beyond the current CF Industries facilities, the proposed park would add an ammonia plant from Clean Hydrogen Works, a Hyundai steel plant, a “blue” ammonia plant from CF Industries and multiple Japanese companies. The term “blue” ammonia is the term used for ammonia produced using “carbon capture,” a disputed technology that purports to capture carbon from smokestacks. Though it is positioned as a way to cut carbon pollution, by either storing it underground or using it to produce more oil, many environmental advocates warn that it only provides cover for polluters.

Ascension Parish and the state of Louisiana are helping to fund the park and related road and rail expansions using a $600 million taxpayer-funded incentive package.

Laying the groundwork for Modeste’s buyout

In May, the Ascension Parish Council approved a resolution to begin exploring a buyout for more than 200 residents. In August, the Council put out a call for firms to develop a Relocation and Buyout Plan.

Four firms submitted bids in response, vying to lead Ascension Parish’s buyout. As of November, none of the firms had been awarded a contract, but The Lens obtained their applications through public record requests.

All four firms have Louisiana ties. One firm, Grant Management Group, is partnering with Middleberg Riddle Group, who count New Orleans City Councilmember JP Morrell as counsel. Another, Ahearn-Alecha Architecture, is led by Matthew Ahearn, founder of New Orleans’ Irish Cultural Museum; their rates for the proposed work are up to $250 per hour.

The other two firms – Timbalier Resources and Desire Line – list partners who count previous work on the resettlement of Isle de Jean Charles as among their qualifications.

“Our team members developed a deep understanding of the sensitivities inherent in requesting families to transfer ownership of property held for generations,” Desire Line wrote of the Isle de Jean Charles project.

That resettlement has been critiqued for the tribe’s loss of self-determination, cultural displacement, and substandard housing at the new site.

To complete the buyouts more quickly, some of the MegaPark companies have hired real estate firms directly, who are already making insultingly low offers to residents, Gaignard said.

“They’re giving buyouts, but the buyouts are really not worth the property,” she said. “I have one gentleman that has their house on an acre of land, and they were offering $150,000. And they’re in their 80s, and they’re like: ‘Where can we go and buy a house [for that low a sum?]”

The offer is less than half the median sale price of a home in Ascension Parish, according to realty website Redfin.

Gaignard said she’s particularly concerned for vulnerable elders in her community, who would struggle if relocated.

Challenging the rezoning

The first steps towards the industrial park’s development came in 2015, when the Ascension Parish Council adopted an ordinance creating the 17,000-acre West Bank Industrial Overlay District. The ordinance made it much easier to rezone land around Modeste from “conservation” to “industrial.”

Developers have been treating that industrial zoning as a given. Even as the rezoning process is challenged, the Ascension Economic Development Corp. advertises the industrial future of the RiverPlex MegaPark.

In August 2025, the Ascension Parish Council voted twice in two weeks to rezone parcels of land for the MegaPark. On August 7, by approving two agenda items, the Council gave industrial zoning to more than 3,400 acres of conservation land in the area planned for the RiverPlex MegaPark.

But the process was questionable, the Rural Roots suit alleges.

When hearing the agenda item, the chair of the council, Chase Melancon, did not receive an audible “yea” vote from every councilmember. Instead, Melancon asked aloud: “Any questions? Any objections? Hearing none, so moved,” and then gaveled the vote through, after waiting less than a second.

Melancon followed the same process on August 21, 2025, when the Council rezoned over 900 acres of land expressly for CF Industries Blue Point LLC, the planned carbon capture facility.

Altogether, the Rural Roots lawsuit challenges the rezoning of about a quarter of the land intended for the MegaPark.

Low-ball buyout offers

Jack Green, a campaign manager with Rise St. James, first learned about the Ascension Parish buyout because Modeste residents were so upset that they drove to St. James looking for help from Rise St. James’ founder, Sharon Lavigne.

Green believes developers are deliberately “building a bunch of industrial access roads right now and using eminent domain to cut up the current housing there.” He thinks this will make it easier for developers to “intimidate the residents into accepting a buyout they don’t want to accept.”

The access roads dividing the neighborhood, as described by Green, are likely in service of the Hyundai Motor Group’s $5.8 billion steel plant, which will begin construction in 2026. Earlier this year, Hyundai executives raised concerns with Louisiana Economic Development about the company’s need for expanded and accelerated road construction in Ascension Parish. The state responded that it was reviewing options to speed up the area road improvements.

Green sees the early buyout offers as part of a broader plan to short-circuit community opposition in Modeste. “There is a coordinated effort,” he said, “between the parish, the state, these industries, and some very, very wealthy real estate firms, to intimidate and get residents out and prevent any kind of solidarity between the residents.”

Hyundai is one of the companies that has jumped ahead to make buyout offers outside the Parish-approved process.

Law firm Kurz & Hebert sent a letter on behalf of Hyundai to Donaldsonville resident Paul Troxclair, who shared it with Green.

“We realize that [address] is your primary residence and want to be sensitive to that,” the August 27 letter reads. “As a result of Hyundai’s experience, they realize their industrial development could negatively affect the neighbors and the value of their property in the future which is the reason behind the offer.”

Hyundai offered Troxclair $395,000, he said, for his two adjoining properties, which together have a market value of $366,700, according to the Ascension Parish Assessor’s Office. But while the offer is 8% above the assessed value, Troxclair said he’s made improvements to the property and added value since it was last assessed in 2024.

Troxclair also knows from first-hand experience that the cost of displacement is far higher than the market value of property: he has been displaced once before, six years ago, from Iberville Parish. That time it was for an expansion by Shintech, a Japanese chemical manufacturer.

Besides the actual costs of moving, some things can’t be packed up nor replaced, Troxclair explained. On his family land in Iberville, “we had orange trees, satsuma trees,” he recalls. “Pecan trees that we picked in the yard since we were kids – they didn’t compensate us for none of our trees or anything like that. And I spent 60 years of my life down there. And they got people here [in Modeste] that’s been here a lot longer than that.”

The TJC Group, a consultant group speaking for Hyundai, told The Lens that “as of December 31, 2025, all the land needed for the development of Hyundai’s Louisiana Steel Mill has been voluntarily sold to the state of Louisiana,” and the State will lease it to Hyundai. “Hyundai is not currently working with Kurz & Hebert or any other real estate firm.”

This summer, Gene Landry, Mekaelyn Lavigne’s grandfather, was also among those who received an offer. His offer, also from a firm representing Hyundai, was so low he threw it away, he said. And even if it were fair, he said, he wouldn’t want to leave a place that has been in his family for more than 100 years.

Black Modeste residents vulnerable

Beyond their fears of low buyout offers, Modeste residents are vulnerable in other ways. Some who face displacement are renters, not homeowners. Others face property-title hurdles that are themselves the legacy of racism.

Land successions are difficult for big families. Ownership can end up spread across numerous extended family members, and so one hold-out cousin can stop or delay a sale. Untangling property rights can be nearly impossible for land that has been held in the same families for generations as society and its laws changed around them. “Those people don’t have a title, or it has been tied up between so many family members because they are the descendants of slaves and sharecroppers living there,” Gaignard said.

Industrial development in Cancer Alley is disproportionately concentrated in majority-Black areas like Modeste.

Public opinion is likewise split along racial lines. A recent survey in Ascension and St. James Parishes, commissioned by Sierra Club’s Delta Chapter, found that 65% of Black respondents are “very concerned” about toxic air and pollution in their community, as opposed to just 24% of white respondents. Asked whether local and state elected officials are doing enough to protect the public’s health from pollution, 40% of Black respondents strongly disagreed, compared with just 17% of white voters.

Though some jurisdictions designate areas for conservation purposes to protect natural habitats, Ascension Parish for decades kept the farmland within the MegaPark-site zoned for “conservation,” to prevent the historically Black area of Modeste from building up subdivisions, Gaignard said. If that was the intent in Ascension, it would follow national trends. Similar exclusionary zoning designations were made across the country, and supported by the federal government after World War II, as Black soldiers returned home and the modern Civil Rights movement began.

But the Ascension Parish Council changed course in 2015, when it created the Overlay to quickly make way for industry.

The legacy of enslavement flows directly into current-day rezoning efforts, Gaignard said. She imagines that local leaders have decided that since “free labor is no longer available, we need to figure out a way to make money off this land,” she said. “And if we can’t get it off sugar cane, we’ll sell it to industry and sell out the people that are left on the land.”

MegaPark companies may cause harm without delivering jobs, advocates fear

The specific companies who’ve set their sights on Ascension Parish – including Hyundai and CF Industries – raise alarms with some watchdogs, who warn that the corporations are likely to harm public health and destroy housing without bringing the promised economic benefits.

Concerns about Hyundai include its use of prison labor in Alabama, which drives down wages in Hyundai’s Southern manufacturing supply chain, according to a November report from Columbia University’s Labor Lab. In the Montgomery area, where Hyundai suppliers are concentrated, auto-supplier wages are 7% to 9% lower compared to similar jobs in Alabama and nearby states, the study found. Hyundai has not indicated whether it will seek to use prison labor in Louisiana.

“If Alabama already depends on incarcerated labor to subsidize Hyundai’s labor costs- with documented lower wages and higher health and safety violations – what prevents that same model from being replicated in Louisiana?” Gaignard said in a statement.

Another RiverPlex MegaPark company, CF Industries, has a plant near Yazoo City in Mississippi that suffered an explosion last month, leading to an ammonia leak and evacuations of nearby residents.

That worries some Modeste residents, because CF’s proposed plant in Ascension would be the largest in the world – three times larger than the Mississippi plant.

“I don’t understand how the same company that just put another community through an explosion and evacuation can now try to convince the people of Modeste and Ascension Parish that building a new ammonia plant is safe,” said Twila Collins, who lives just a mile from the proposed site in Modeste.

The lawsuit and “viva voce”

Gaignard took inspiration for the October lawsuit from a somewhat surprising place: a lawsuit by conservative Louisiana AG Liz Murrill. Both lawsuits challenge a voting approach common throughout Louisiana.

The argument is around the concept of “viva voce,” literally meaning “with the living voice.” It means that legislators must vote by speaking aloud – not with a show of hands, or using an electronic device, or being asked for an objection. The idea is to ensure transparency, as legislators may not vote in silence and thereby escape public scrutiny.

Rural Roots’ suit argues that Ascension Parish Council violated the Louisiana Constitution and Louisiana’s Open Meetings Law by simply asking for objections on the rezoning vote, sidestepping audible votes from every councilmember.

“The Louisiana Attorney General has recently pointed out that Louisiana law requires that voting by parish councils must be ‘viva voce,’” reads the lawsuit.

Murrill used a similar argument earlier this year to accuse Caddo Parish Council of violating the ‘viva voce’ requirement on a much more superficial matter: a resolution welcoming celebrated Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders to Shreveport.

A July vote ratifying “the Resolution Welcoming U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (“Sanders Resolution”) failed to comply with the viva voce voting requirements,” reads Murrill’s suit. “Any form of silent, electronic tallying that lacks an audible, spoken expression by each voting member is insufficient.”

If either is successful, the lawsuits could push other Louisiana parishes to change their voting practices. Currently, the Baton Rouge Metro Council typically votes through unanimous consent. Others, like the New Orleans City Council, vote electronically.

Gaignard and Murrill’s lawsuits could force a change. Bossier City has already dropped electronic voting as a result of Murrill’s suit. The New Orleans City Council is waiting to see how the lawsuit plays out.

Adrian Alpay, one of the lawyers on the Ascension case, told The Lens, “What we’re asking is pretty simple: that the members of the Ascension Parish Council follow state law and the Louisiana Constitution. The public has a right to observe how their government votes.”

If the suits are successful, they could make recent legislative votes vulnerable to challenges: suits filed within 60 days can void votes.

In December, Rural Roots and Bucket Brigade filed two more suits against Ascension Parish Council and Ascension Economic Development Corp. for withholding public records and keeping the deals shrouded in secrecy through non-disclosure agreements.

Gaignard isn’t interested in financial gain, and knows that even if it’s successful, the lawsuits filed around the MegaPark present more of a hurdle than a true roadblock. Still, she wants the councilmembers’ votes recorded. If the Modeste she knows is lost, she wants public records to show who chose to unstitch the fabric of their community.

“I just want accountability,” she said. “I want those leaders making this choice to forever have it in writing…them being the demise of their own community.”",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Buyouts_threaten_to_erase_Modeste-0467_2048px-thelensnola.png,N,,2026-01-12 14:04:34.009011

Here in the South, the inflation rate is lower than the national average, at 2.2%.","There is currently a “vibecession” occurring — a state defined by a persistent sense of malaise about the economy due to factors like high grocery prices and housing costs. What is really going on?

In evaluating North Carolina’s economy or, really, any economy, you want to know if the engine is growing, that there are enough jobs for people, that people can borrow at reasonable rates, and that the dollar you hold today is worth about the same as it did a year ago. If those four metrics are solid, we are good. Using Pareto’s 80/20 principle — the idea that 20% of any set of numbers constitutes 80% of the value of the entire set — we know that real GDP, the unemployment rate, interest rates, and inflation drive the vast majority of what is important.

If those four numbers are excellent and all other economic metrics are falling apart, we still get a B. If all other numbers are great and those four numbers are bad, we get an F. These metrics are the best hard data to confirm whether there is any meat to the malaise.

When rhetoric gets loud, look at the basic math.

Gross Domestic Product

First, consider gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is simply the value of all goods and services produced in a nation within a timeframe. Think of it as a state or country’s “top line” revenue. Nationally, we just saw third-quarter GDP growth accelerating to 4.3% — the highest rate in two years. Historically, anything above 3% is outstanding.

In North Carolina, our state’s real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.7% in the second quarter (the most recent data available), ranking us among the top states in the Southeast. That rate is expected to be 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in the final two quarters of 2025, according to estimates from UNC Charlotte’s North Carolina Economic Forecast. Based on everything we know about GDP today, our state and national economic engines are running smoothly. Real GDP — Check.

Unemployment

In contrast, nationally, unemployment sits at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Here at home, North Carolina’s unemployment rate has consistently hovered around 3.7% to 3.8%, below the national average. But even a look at the national average benefits from context. Economists consider “full employment” — where there is a good balance of job openings to unattached workers — to be about 5%. Too far below that and it can be considered a labor shortage. Since 1950, the average US unemployment rate has been about 5.7%. In 2020, it spiked to 14.8%. The math is simple: If you want a job today, the odds are heavily in your favor. Employment — Check.

Interest Rates

Next, interest rates. The Federal Reserve recently set a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Historically, 30-year mortgages run 2 to 3 percentage points higher than that rate, and they currently sit around 6%. We are in a cooling-off period after mortgage rates peaked near 8% in late 2023. If you are anchored to the sub-3% rates of 2020 — a once-in-a-century anomaly — 6% doesn’t feel so good. But the historical average since 1971 is 7.4%. North Carolina’s housing inventory is increasing, and we are currently borrowing at low rates compared to the last five decades. Interest rates — Check.

Inflation

Finally, the annual inflation rate in the US is currently around 2.7%. Here in the South, the inflation rate is lower than the national average, at 2.2%. Both rates are higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target but well below the 75-year average of 3.5%. Remember, the COVID-era high was 9.1% in June 2022. Things still “feel” bad because we are carrying the scars of the last few years. Prices aren’t dropping, but the speed of their increase has significantly slowed. We are still paying for the 24% total price hike endured since 2021, but the bleeding has stopped. With inflation at 2.7% nationally and 2.2% in North Carolina, the engine is cooling to a healthy temperature. Inflation — Check.

The Verdict

The answer: Despite the “vibecession” narrative, the economy is recovering. I think we get an A-minus, no matter who the teacher is — Democrat or Republican.

One last item. Who drives all these metrics? Certainly not the politicians. It is the small-business person. They create the jobs, growth and innovation. They build a healthy economy. Small businesses generated a net increase of almost 90% of all new jobs in North Carolina in the most recent annual period.

These businesses have been operating in a fog of mixed information and a quickly changing policy environment. Predictability is the oxygen needed for entrepreneurs because their lives are already upside down with risk. They need the certainty to plan, hire and invest. So, people, let’s not confuse the creators. It is time to move past the noise and get back to business.

Nuclear’s global energy share has dropped to 9%, marking the lowest point in 40 years.2 By contrast, solar and wind are being added at rates more than a hundred times faster than nuclear capacity.3 Fleet aging is a critical operational and financial issue amid exponential load growth: Two-thirds of reactors worldwide are now older than 31 years and 48 net reactor units have come offline since 2005.4

Careful planning, proactive risk management and strategic investment are some of the essentials to help manage the sector’s challenges:

With fleets aging, the risk of wear-out failures rises per the expectant “bathtub curve” — unless proactively managed.

Challenging the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) default fallacy is important to secure the insurability and bankability of SMRs.

Before fuel loading can begin, stakeholders in the construction phase must align on risk allocation, indemnities and insurance.

People remain at the heart of nuclear’s progress — but with an aging workforce, tight supply of skilled candidates and intense competition, talent pipelines risk running dry as demand surges.

Nuclear development is more urgent with energy security under threat. Recent geopolitical shocks, such as the spike in gas and electricity prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, exposed the fragility of energy systems reliant on limited sources. Scaling nuclear power offers a pathway to greater market stability and long-term energy resilience.

Below, we provide a blueprint to manage risk and enable progress in nuclear investments across four pillars: SMR industrialization, life extension, project delivery, and workforce retention and attraction.

Trend 1: Challenge the FOAK Fallacy in SMRs

SMRs can replace decommissioned coal stations and serve a broad spectrum of users — from isolated communities to industrial hubs — making them ideal for decarbonization and brownfield deployment. Their modular architecture enables phased deployment, aligning capital expenditure with near-term load forecasts to reduce upfront financial risk. But to realize their full potential, developers must prioritize repeatability, standardization and proactive risk management.

Large Reactors Large Reactors (Advanced) Small Modular Reactors Microreactors Timeline Since 1950s (current fleet) Deployed recently In development In development Footprint (km2) 6 Varies 0.2 <0.004 Electrical Capacity (MW) 1,000+ 400-1,400 20-300 <20 EPZ (km) 16 0.24-16 0.311 <0.311 Coolant Water Water, gas, metal, salt Water, gas, metal, salt Water, gas, metal, salt Control Approach Active Mostly passive Mostly passive Mostly passive End Products Electricity, heat Electricity, heat, steam Electricity, heat, steam Electricity, heat, steam Applications Base load electrical power Base load, demand response, industrial electricity, industrial processes such as hydrogen production Base load, demand response, industrial electricity, industrial processes such as hydrogen production Power for remote locations, mobile backup power, maritime shipping, mining, military, disaster relief, hydrogen production Customers Large utilities Mostly large utilities with some associated industries Utilities, municipalities, industry Military, municipalities, industry Cost Range $5-9 billion Mixed $800 million-3 billion $49-86 million Scalability Adding new reactors is difficult Mixed Designed to add new reactors as demand increases Designed to add new reactors as demand increases

Only a handful of SMRs are operational today — in Russia and China — while progress on new-build construction projects is gaining traction in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. Limited operational track records, alongside high capital costs, the volume of competing designs and regulatory uncertainty, continue to challenge insurability and investor confidence. To be widely deployed, small and advanced modular reactors must achieve a competitive levelized cost of electricity — estimates vary from $60/MWh to $140/MWh. Achieving this will depend on standardization and serial factory manufacturing.

Many view SMR projects as FOAK by default, but this is not always accurate. A significant number of leading SMR programs adapt proven Gen III and Gen III+ reactor designs with lower output to reduce technological and execution risk. Using established operational data and regulatory precedents helps streamline deployment and accelerate project maturity.

Even the classification of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs) as FOAK belies their historical context. In the U.S., SFR technology dates back to the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (1964–1994) and the Fast Flux Test Facility (1982–1992). France, Russia and Japan have also operated SFR prototypes for decades. While the concept isn’t new, SFRs have yet to be deployed commercially at scale.

Comprehensive insurable risk breakdowns conducted in collaboration with consultants and engineering teams can help secure design insurability and accelerate deployment.

The “silver tsunami” looms over the sector, which has a proportion of workers approaching retirement than both the wider energy workforce and national averages. Attracting new talent is increasingly competitive, with nuclear energy vying against technology and finance for top recruits. Yet Big Tech’s investment in nuclear to power artificial intelligence (AI) platforms is also helping to reshape the sector’s public image, making it more appealing to younger professionals.

Talent cultivation initiatives, like Destination Nuclear in the United Kingdom and the Nuclear Reactor Safety Training and Workforce Development Program in the U.S., aim to build the next generation of nuclear professionals — with safety top-of-mind. Mentorship, knowledge transfer and frameworks from the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Association of Nuclear Operators remain vital, alongside strategies to keep organizations’ talent engines running — and growing.

Proposed development, including a power plant and data center, has raised concerns about the area's future.

The basin provides critical habitats for endangered species, migratory birds, and thousands of sea turtles.

Lower South Carolina is home to one of the largest natural gems in the eastern United States, but with proposed plans for new development in the area many feel that it may be under attack.

Elsewhere in this edition and on our webpages you may read about proposals to build a new power plant, powered by more than 70 miles of natural gas pipeline, along with a massive new data center —and all of these projects are slated for the ACE Basin watershed area.

But what is the ACE Basin, and why is it so important?

Centered around the Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto rivers in Beaufort, Colleton and Charleston counties, between the coastal cities of Charleston and Beaufort, the 1.6-million-acre Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto (ACE) Basin watershed is one of the largest areas of undeveloped wetlands/uplands ecosystems remaining on the Atlantic Coast.

This remarkable interlocking web of ecosystems includes forested uplands and wetlands, extensive tidal marshes, managed wetlands, barrier islands and peatlands, states The Nature Conservancy, a global nonprofit conservation group that works to protect threatened habitats, lands and waters.

Once the home of numerous rice plantations, the area now provides important habitats for waterfowl, migratory birds and endangered species , as well as 33 types of natural plant communities.

The area is also home to three major natural reserves, including the ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), which is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources using funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

According to its S.C. Department of Natural Resources webpage, NERR's nearly 100,000 protected acres are home not only to wildlife, including shortnose sturgeon, loggerhead sea turtles, diamondback rattlesnakes and bald eagles, but also to cultural and archaeological resources.

NERR also serves as a community hub for coastal science and learning by organizations such as SCDNR and the Coastal Conservation League. The NERR educational programs include K-12 field trips, teacher workshops, and other educational resources, making the ACE Basin one of the largest outdoor classrooms in the country.

In addition to NERR, the ACE Basin is also home to the Botany Bay Plantation Heritage Preserve/Wildlife Management Area and The Ernest F. Hollings ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge.

Botany Bay Plantation Heritage Preserve/Wildlife Management Area is the yearly nesting site for approximately 50 to 100 sea turtles. The nests are protected from predators and as a result it is estimated that 3,000 to 10,000 sea turtles hatch on the island annually.

The Ernest F. Hollings ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge is a mosaic of lands and waters that harbors an abundance of migratory and resident birds, reptiles and amphibians, fish and other wildlife.

History of the ACE Basin

Provided by SCDNR

Humans have lived and utilized natural resources in the ACE Basin for thousands of years. The first human presence in the Basin occurred approximately 6,000 years ago with the Paleoindians. Like their Asian counterparts, Paleoindians are believed to have lived in mobile hunter-gatherer groups and hunted large animals such as mammoths and mastodons. New ways of hunting and gathering marked the end of the Paleoindian period and the beginning of the Archaic period and the modern-day Native Americans.

Until the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century, Paleoindian culture evolved into a more sedentary society that relied on hunting in smaller territories and agriculture. Semipermanent villages of several families were built near hunting grounds. Villagers tilled and planted crops such as corn, beans, and squash. During the summer months, the entire village moved to the homesteads near the coast, where they subsisted on seafood and wild plants, particularly roots.

Human activities have shaped the history, and the cultural and natural resources of the Basin. Early Carolinians cleared thousands of acres of old-growth hardwood forests and planted a variety of crops including corn, tobacco, and root crops. Tens of thousands of acres of bottomland hardwoods along the navigable rivers and creeks of the ACE Basin study area were converted to rice fields.

From the early 1700's to mid 1800's, much of the ACE Basin was home to large plantations owned by a small number of individuals who managed their wetlands primarily to grow rice using enslaved labor.

After the rice culture declined in the late 1800's, wealthy sportsmen purchased many of these plantations as hunting retreats. The new owners successfully managed the former rice fields and adjacent upland estates for a wide range of wildlife. Undeveloped and unpolluted, the habitat remains diverse and extremely productive.

Lumber companies of the late 1800s to early 1900s logged most of the virgin pine forests and swamplands in Colleton County and surrounding counties. Improvements in farming techniques, and the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway, roads, and railways were instrumental in promoting the development of the farming industry during the early twentieth century. Today, the extensive pine plantations and rice field systems established during this period are still evident.

The abandoned rice fields and logged forests attracted a rich abundance of game animals, including migratory waterfowl and deer to the area. The interest in hunting led to the evolution of sophisticated wildlife management techniques that help to preserve the natural quality of the ACE Basin study area that we enjoy today.

Most of the more well-known archaeological sites in the ACE Basin date from the recent historic period, particularly the 18th and 19th centuries when the area flourished as a prosperous agricultural region, and hundreds of sites have been formally recognized, with hundreds more likely still out there. Historians hope that the preservation of these cultural resources will sustain them for tourism and future generations.

The area is also the historical home to one of most important slave rescue operations of the Civil War.

According to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, on June 2, 1863, Harriet Tubman, under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, became the first woman to lead a major military operation in the United States when she and 150 African American Union soldiers rescued more than 700 slaves in the Combahee Ferry Raid.

Tubman, often referred to as “the Moses of her people,” was a former slave who fled to freedom in 1849. Tubman worked for years to bring enslaved women, men, and children from the south to the north through the Underground Railroad.

“The reason companies haven’t been using the global models is they’re not as easy to come by.
“When available tools neglect international sources of emissions, companies’ sustainability decisions suffer,” said study co-author Michael Steffen, Watershed’s head of climate analytics.
Corporations seeking to track and reduce emissions in their supply chains have the potential to make a meaningful difference in global carbon pollution, Davis said.
If those dollars are directed to the right places, it could meaningfully reduce global emissions,” he said.","A new Stanford-led analysis of corporate carbon disclosures finds companies undercount emissions from their supply chains by billions of tons.

The shortfall arises from use of a popular statistical model that assumes all suppliers are located in the United States. “Supply chains are global, though, so a model that assumes everything is made domestically is going to give us a wrong answer,” said Steve Davis, a professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the Dec. 20 study in Nature Communications.

Davis and co-authors set out to find out how far off estimates are under the common approach compared to results from an alternative model that considers emissions data from the regions where suppliers actually operate. They found the widely used single-region U.S. model, maintained until recently by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, missed about 2 billion tons, or 10% of emissions tied to more than 400 companies’ supply chains in 2023. That’s roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of Russia or India.

The additional 2023 emissions included approximately 973 million tons of emissions attributed to suppliers in China, which relies heavily on coal. The biggest gaps emerged in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as steel and concrete, construction machinery, fabricated metals used for cars and infrastructure, and electronic components.

Companies relying on estimates from single-region U.S. models may overlook the emissions impact of importing energy-intensive manufactured goods from China and Russia, according to the study. They may also miss opportunities to reduce emissions and associated costs by sourcing those goods from countries with cleaner grids, such as the U.S., France, and Brazil.

At the start of 2026, as an expanded carbon border tariff takes effect in Europe, the cost of upstream emissions is increasing for EU importers of manufactured goods, including steel, aluminum, and cement. “A company that’s interested in reducing the emissions in their supply chain needs to know not just how big the number is, but also where these emissions are coming from,” Davis said.

Expanding access to better data

Together with collaborators including lab member Wesley Ingwersen, who created the U.S. EPA model and led work on it until the agency shuttered it in August 2025, Davis is now working to make a global model freely available and easy to use through an effort called Cornerstone. “The reason companies haven’t been using the global models is they’re not as easy to come by. They are a lot more involved to build, and there hasn’t been an easy, open-source version,” said Davis.

The group is integrating the former government database with the multi-region model analyzed in the study, which was developed by a private company called Watershed, where Davis chairs the science advisory board and previously served as head of climate science.

“When available tools neglect international sources of emissions, companies’ sustainability decisions suffer,” said study co-author Michael Steffen, Watershed’s head of climate analytics.

The team aims to release the merged model in late 2026, with ambitions to account for emissions from land-use changes and deforestation in later research and iterations. “If you’re getting soybeans from Iowa, it has a very different footprint than if you’ve cut down some of the Amazon to grow those soybeans,” Davis said.

Scientists from the World Wildlife Fund and CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, co-authored the paper. “These are NGOs that are really interested in minimizing greenwashing and making sure that corporate climate actions are as beneficial as possible,” Davis said.

Some critics question whether models based on sector-wide averages and spending like those analyzed in the study are the right approach to estimate upstream emissions at all – regardless of whether global or single-region models are used. “I think we could all agree that if you had perfect data about exactly what was going on in your supply chain, you could make even more accurate estimates and leapfrog all of these models,” Davis said. “The reality is, though, that it’s still really difficult to get a lot of that data, and there’s little prospect of getting it without much more stringent regulations than are even on the table.” As a result, he said, there’s value in improving the modeling approach even if the long-term strategy is to get better data.

Corporations seeking to track and reduce emissions in their supply chains have the potential to make a meaningful difference in global carbon pollution, Davis said. “They are making sizable investments. If those dollars are directed to the right places, it could meaningfully reduce global emissions,” he said.",https://sustainability.stanford.edu/sites/sustainability/files/styles/large/public/media/image/gettyimages-539636438_0.jpg?itok=JOGemCqr,N,,2026-01-12 13:01:29.705337

This month’s update covers major congressional action on permitting reform and defense authorization, alongside significant developments in critical minerals investment, clean energy tax policy, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and federal energy regulation. From the House’s passage of the SPEED Act to FERC’s intervention on AI data center interconnections, these updates highlight how energy, national security, and technology policy will continue to converge in the new year, along with broader geopolitical events.

House Passes Permitting Reform Legislation

The House passed the SPEED Act, a sweeping overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by a 221-196 vote. Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill, while one Republican voted against it. During committee markup, Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) worked with lead Democratic co-sponsor Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) to add language making it harder for future presidents to revoke permits for energy projects of all types, an effort aimed at broadening Democratic support.

That compromise, however, sparked backlash from hardline Republicans, who argued the provision would “undermine” the Trump administration’s efforts to curb offshore wind development. To secure GOP votes, party leaders weakened the measure, prompting the American Clean Power Association and several Democrats to withdraw their support. Despite those defections, the bill ultimately cleared the House.

The changes may complicate negotiations with the Senate, though. Any broader bipartisan deal is likely to extend beyond NEPA to include reforms to the Clean Water Act to ease pipeline permitting — a key Republican priority — as well as provisions to facilitate interstate transmission development, which Democrats view as essential for bringing clean energy onto the nation’s power grid, but which House Republicans have so far resisted.

Further complicating the passage of the SPEED Act, and potentially killing any momentum for the foreseeable future, the White House halted construction of all US offshore wind projects three days before Christmas. While consistent with President Trump’s disdain for offshore wind, it will likely further erode Democratic and even some Republican support for the bill. It could also make Republicans vulnerable going into midterm elections in 2026, when electricity prices and general questions of electricity supply will likely be in focus.

NDAA Passes Congress

Both chambers of Congress passed the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing $901 billion for national security programs — $8 billion above the president’s budget request. The legislation includes several provisions with significant implications for energy, critical minerals, and industrial policy.

The Defense Industrial Base Fund is expanded to allow the Secretary of Defense to invest across defense supply chains, including materials, components, finished products, testing and qualification, infrastructure, facility construction and improvement, and equipment — explicitly encompassing critical minerals, materials, and chemicals. The bill also directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency, to expand recovery and reuse of strategic and critical materials under the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program.

In addition, the NDAA establishes an Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs to oversee a new Arctic Watcher Program, aimed at strengthening US energy security, cybersecurity, and economic interests in the Arctic, particularly in critical minerals and natural resources.

The bill updates covered technology categories for the Office of Strategic Capital to include nuclear fission and fusion energy technologies, extends the Defense Production Act through September 30, 2026, and reauthorizes the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) through 2031.

The DFC reauthorization significantly expands the agency’s authority, raising its investment cap to $205 billion — an increase of more than 300% — creating a $5 billion equity revolving fund, and allowing equity investments of up to 40% minority ownership. The legislation also expands geographic eligibility to all countries except the wealthiest 20, while maintaining limited investment authority in those countries through Five Eyes partnerships and select sectors, including energy, critical minerals and rare earths, and information and communications technology such as undersea cables. No more than 10% of the DFC’s maximum contingent liability may be used in wealthy or high-income countries.

Wind and Solar Tax Credit Lawsuit

A coalition of tribal, environmental, local, and consumer groups filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Trump administration rules that make it more difficult for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. The suit argues that new Treasury Department guidance unlawfully changes how the start of construction is determined for wind and solar facilities — eliminating the long-standing 5% safe harbor in favor of a stricter physical-work requirement — while leaving other technologies unaffected, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Led by the Oregon Environmental Council, the plaintiffs contend the rules unfairly discriminate against renewable energy, threaten investment and jobs in the wind and solar industries, and will reduce clean energy capacity, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. The lawsuit seeks to have the guidance declared arbitrary and capricious and vacated, as part of broader opposition to Trump administration efforts to roll back Biden-era clean energy policies.Treasury declined to comment on the litigation, and the IRS stated it does not comment on pending cases.

FERC Orders PJM to Revise AI Data Center Interconnection Rules

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, to develop new rules governing how loads, such as artificial intelligence data centers, connect to the electricity grid when they are co-located with power generators. FERC found PJM’s proposed co-location tariff to be “unjust and unreasonable,” citing a lack of clarity and consistency in rates, terms, and conditions for both generators serving co-located load and transmission customers.

The commission directed PJM to establish new transmission service options, with proposed terms expected early this year, and to submit a report by January 19, 2026 addressing reliability concerns associated with determining the amount of new capacity that is needed to maintain system reliability. The ruling is expected to influence FERC’s broader approach to the Department of Energy’s proposed rule to accelerate data center interconnections, which has drawn more than 160 public comments. With regard to the Department of Energy’s proposal, FERC Chair Laura Swett said FERC is actively reviewing the proposal and will move “as quickly as we can once we are ready.”

DOE Advances the Genesis Mission

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced agreements with 24 organizations to collaborate on the Genesis Mission to advance US artificial intelligence innovation, following responses to a recent request for information and ongoing project partnerships with DOE and the national laboratories. Participating organizations include major technology and AI leaders such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anthropic, Cerebras, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Oracle, Palantir, xAI, and XPRIZE, among others.

DOE also noted that two related RFIs remain open: “Partnerships for Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models” through January 14, 2026, and “Transformational AI Capabilities for National Security” through January 23, 2026.

Continued Critical Minerals Investments

The Trump administration is backing the construction of a $7.4 billion zinc smelter in Tennessee as part of a broader push to expand domestic critical minerals production through direct federal investment. Under the agreement, South Korea’s Korea Zinc will acquire the only operating primary zinc smelter in the United States and construct a new, modern facility capable of processing 13 different critical and strategic minerals beginning in 2029.

The project will be partially financed through a $1.9 billion joint venture involving investment from the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital. The deal follows South Korea’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States as part of trade negotiations aimed at avoiding higher US tariffs.

Frenzel sat down with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari to talk data centers, electricity prices, nuclear energy, labor markets and more.
Data centers and the oil and gas sector, however, have the potential to drive more rapid demand expansion, he said.
Xcel CEO an ‘unabashed nuclear fan’ Nuclear energy is the “preferred source of energy for data centers,” Frenzel said.
“All the things that we need to build transmission, distribution and power plants, they need to build data centers,” Frenzel said.","The growth of data centers can help reduce residential electricity rates, but power equipment supply chains remain stretched and there are labor shortages in specialized fields needed to build out the grid, Xcel Energy Chairman, President and CEO Bob Frenzel said Friday in a discussion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

“We’re at a major inflection point in the United States’ history, as it pertains to the next wave of important infrastructure,” Frenzel said. “That’s going to be artificial intelligence infrastructure.”

Xcel is headquartered in Minneapolis and serves power and gas customers across eight states: Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico and Texas. In October, the utility company raised its five-year capital spending plan to $60 billion, to include 7.5 GW of new renewable generation, 3 GW of new gas generation, 1.9 GW of energy storage, 1,500 miles of high-voltage transmission and $5 billion for wildfire mitigation.

New data center load represents about 60% of Xcel’s anticipated retail sales growth through 2030, officials said.

Frenzel sat down with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari to talk data centers, electricity prices, nuclear energy, labor markets and more. Here are five takeaways from their conversation.

Multiple demand growth drivers

The U.S. economy is “sending us mixed signals,” Kashkari said. “The labor market looks like it’s cooling gently. The stock market is doing well. There is a lot of investment in AI and data centers ... Are you optimistic on the economy?”

“I feel good about the parts of the economy that we touch and the ability to continue to help drive our customers’ businesses forward,” Frenzel said.

Like many utilities in the United States, Frenzel said Xcel has seen electric demand grow about 0.5% annually for the last 10 to 15 years, largely due to population growth with some offsets for energy efficiency.

“That model feels pretty good to us. The region, our customers who we talk to regularly, feel pretty good that underlying economic growth is probably about a half a percent a year,” he said.

Data centers and the oil and gas sector, however, have the potential to drive more rapid demand expansion, he said.

“What’s driving real growth is powering the current data centers that we serve, and the ones that are [coming]. That’s probably the Upper Midwest driver,” Frenzel said.

Another “huge piece of our business growth” is serving oil and gas activity in the Texas panhandle and southeastern New Mexico, “which is the heart of the Delaware and the Permian basins.”

Along with active drilling, “those producers continue to look for electrification and decarbonization of their own load. So instead of using diesel and natural gas powered rigs and compression, they’re using electric jack-up rigs and using electric pumps and motors and compression. So we’re seeing electric demand sort of two-fold down in the southwest region of our business as well,” Frenzel said.

Supply chains are degrading

Covid-19 gummed up supply chains around the world. Despite efforts to restore normal operations, “I just keep hearing about the long, long lead for anything electrical related,” Kashkari said.

Lead times for equipment procurement are “not getting better” and are “actually degrading,” Frenzel replied.

“We used to be able to get a transformer in a year. Now it’s closer to three years,” he said.

Combustion turbine gas plant construction used to take 18 months and now run 4 to 5 years, he added.

“We need to look forward more and plan more, and we need to build the infrastructure that’s needed further in advance,” Frenzel said. “That takes an enormous amount of thoughtfulness on our side, and partnership on the side of our regulators and our other stakeholders.”

Supply chain delays are “causing us to have to behave differently and, in partnership with our other stakeholders, to really be proactive,” he said.

Alternative rate structures protect customers

Investment in data centers “seems to be the big bright spot on the U.S. economy,” Kashkari said, with tariffs and trade uncertainty putting a damper on some areas. “There’s a lot of concern that, hey, is AI a bubble? ... How do you think about that?”

Xcel is in “daily conversation” with the largest hyperscale data center developers, Frenzel said.

“If we overbuild, that means that the people overpay,” he said. To counter the threat to other ratepayers, the utility is looking at alternative types of rate arrangements.

“We’re trying to find long-term pricing arrangements with the Metas, the Googles, the Amazons of the world,” Frenzel said. “Think 15-20 year contracts. Minimum revenue requirements, or minimum floor takes, in terms of contract pricing. So that we can make sure that we build infrastructure to support them, that infrastructure is amortized over the life of that contract, and we protect our existing customer base.”

If data centers are managed correctly, the new load should help put downward pressure on rates, Frenzel said. The grid is a fixed asset and so increased data center demand, “all things being equal,” should help to offset economic price pressures.

Xcel CEO an ‘unabashed nuclear fan’

Nuclear energy is the “preferred source of energy for data centers,” Frenzel said.

The U.S. has about 100 reactors that provide about 50% of the country’s carbon free electricity, he said. A major power sector question is whether to pivot to other sources or redouble investment in nuclear.

“Our nuclear fleet in this country is probably close to 40 years old ... Are we going to revitalize that as a core energy source for the United States? I think we should. I think it should be a national imperative. I think it should be a national initiative,” said Frenzel, a former nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy.

But that will also require that U.S. industrial policy ensure development of a domestic fuel supply chain, he noted, pointing to the U.S. Department of Energy’s commitment of $2.7 billion to strengthen enrichment services over the next 10 years.

“We need the actual supply chain here. We need the skilled labor here,” Frenzel said. “It has to be an all-parts-of -government and all-parts-of-industry effort to bring a national nuclear renaissance forward.”

Data center development spikes engineering, procurement and construction costs

The unemployment rate ticked down last week, Kashkari noted. “Nationally, it seems to be a low hiring, low firing environment,” he said. “What [is Xcel] experiencing as you continue to build out your infrastructure?”

Labor markets are relatively neutral, Frenzel said, though “pockets are really getting more and more challenging.”

Data center developers have announced new construction plans totaling about $600 billion in capital spending, Frenzel said. While some of that is for computing infrastructure such as chips, it also creates competition for engineering, concrete, steel, cabling, controls, pumps, valves and HVAC.

“All the things that we need to build transmission, distribution and power plants, they need to build data centers,” Frenzel said. “And so where we’re seeing pressure in the labor markets: engineers, linemen, electricians, plumbing, pipe fitting, concrete, groundwork, civil work. All of that stuff has been a labor market push from our perspective.”

“When I look at what we’re paying for engineering and procurement and construction partners ... we’re seeing real pricing pressure, probably 30% to 40% over the last year or two, in terms of EPC rates for new construction,” he added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XczUS41OGE01aLBbtRg2bRVjLDzj8AwqYKe61-SpKNo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9YY2VsY29udm8ucG5n.webp,N,,2026-01-12 14:16:03.872119

Argent’s project received support last week in a vote in the Louisiana Senate, according to a report in LNG Industry.
The resolution, which passed in 36-3 vote, was introduced by state Sen. Michael Fesi, a Republican representing Louisiana’s District 20, which includes the Port Fourchon area.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission formally requested public comments on the scope of issues that should be addressed in the environmental document, the filing shows.

Metairie-based Argent, which wants to build a liquefaction plant with annual capacity of 25 million tons per year on a 900-acre site on Bayou Lafourche, would be the first homegrown company operating in Louisiana’s rapidly expanding LNG export industry. Jonathan Bass, a native Louisianan, is the company’s founder, chairperson and CEO.

The five large-scale LNG exporters now building plants in Louisiana, all owned by out-of-state companies, will add about 75 million tons of capacity over the next five years, according to industry analysts. The LNG exporters building the plants are based in Houston, Arlington, Virginia and Australia.

Argent LNG says its “Louisiana First” approach prioritizes local hiring and local manufacturing partnerships. The company prioritizes the use of local contractors and suppliers and keeping investments in the regional economy, citing its partnership with Grand Isle Shipyard, a firm based in Galliano, Louisiana.

Argent’s project received support last week in a vote in the Louisiana Senate, according to a report in LNG Industry. The resolution, which passed in 36-3 vote, was introduced by state Sen. Michael Fesi, a Republican representing Louisiana’s District 20, which includes the Port Fourchon area.

“This resolution sends a clear message: Louisiana is open for business and fostering world-class energy investment, built by Louisiana workers, with American technology, and for the benefit of our allies,” Fesi said in a statement.

“Port Fourchon is uniquely positioned to host a project that will define our state’s energy future for generations, while leaning in to support the President’s Energy Dominance Council in supplying countries of shared values with base-load energy to develop sustainable energy solutions. Louisiana will lead the world in delivering affordable energy to provide opportunity to citizens around the globe who align with US principles,” said Fesi.

Last July, the Greater Lafourche Port Commission acquired a 743-acre tract from the state to add to an existing 150-acre site, with the purchase specifically intended to provide Argent with the space needed to build a large-scale LNG facility.

Argent LNG hosted a community open house in early December at the Greater Lafourche Port Commission office, attended by 200 local government officials and community members, reported The National Law Review.

Australia and several other countries are joining a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies in Washington on Monday on the subject, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said over the weekend.

The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here.

Most of the G7, which includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada - with the European Union also taking part - are heavily dependent on rare earths supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Australia, among the world's leading producers of critical minerals, has been developing a strategic reserve to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities which it plans to make available to allies.

""The world needs critical minerals - Australia has plenty of them and our critical minerals reserve will help us weather global economic uncertainty and help to boost trade and investment,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement.

The first minerals in focus are crucial for clean energy and high-technology manufacturing as well as advanced military equipment, the treasurer's office said.

""The Reserve will operate by securing rights to minerals produced in Australia and on-selling those rights to meet demand, giving an added boost to Australia’s critical minerals sector and strengthening reliable supply chains for our trading partners,"" it said.

Australia plans to introduce legislation that will expand the powers of its export finance agency (EFA) and the department of industry, which will oversee reserve-related transactions, Minister for Resources Madeleine King told a press briefing in Perth.

The reserve, originally targeted for launch by mid-2026, will be operational by year-end, King said.

The EFA will enable offtake agreements with fixed or floating prices trading in forward contracts, she said, which are those set for future delivery of physical supply.

It will also manage offtake agreements and intermediary demand and supply aggregation, as well as stockpiling and contracts for difference, King said.

Contracts for difference are a tool that helps manage price risk from when a contract begins, to when it is delivered.

Australia signed an agreement with the U.S. in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals that are vulnerable to disruption.

On January 9, Meta said it has reached agreements that could support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and extended nuclear generation by 2035, spanning existing plants, capacity uprates, and advanced reactor development. The projects are intended to supply power into regional grids that support Meta’s operations, including its AI infrastructure in Ohio.

Unlike renewable power purchase agreements that primarily address emissions goals, these deals emphasize reliability and capacity certainty—a growing concern as AI workloads drive continuous, high-load electricity demand.

Preserving and Expanding Existing Nuclear Capacity

A central element of Meta’s strategy involves extending the life and output of operating nuclear plants in the PJM Interconnection region, one of the most capacity-constrained power markets in the U.S.

Through agreements with Vistra, Meta is supporting continued operations and uprates at three nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The uprates, totaling 433 megawatts, are expected to come online in the early 2030s and would increase firm generation without the long timelines associated with new construction.

For grid planners and facilities leaders, such uprates can be particularly valuable, as they deliver incremental capacity faster than new builds while reinforcing regional reliability.

Betting on Advanced Nuclear for the 2030s

Meta is also backing next-generation nuclear through agreements with TerraPower and Oklo.

The TerraPower agreement supports development of up to eight Natrium® reactor units, representing 2.8 GW of baseload power with integrated energy storage, targeted for deployment beginning in the early 2030s. Oklo’s planned advanced nuclear campus in Ohio could add up to 1.2 GW of new baseload capacity to the PJM market as early as 2030.

While these projects remain long-dated, the agreements provide developers with financial certainty and signal how large energy users are planning years ahead of load growth.

More From Our Experts

Affordable, accessible energy underpins U.S. security and prosperity. Federally funded energy innovations, from the invention of nuclear power to the development of shale gas, have created many opportunities to advance those goals. Such advances can mitigate ever-evolving threats as well, including climate change, which is damaging societies and ecosystems worldwide and will worsen in the years to come. New technologies that are cheaper and cleaner than those that predominate today are creating markets that will be worth trillions of dollars. China has seized this opportunity aggressively, taking commanding positions in rapidly growing industries like solar power and lithium-ion batteries.

President Donald Trump has dismissed climate science. But many of his priorities for energy policy, including meeting the insatiable demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, making energy more affordable for average Americans, and catalyzing a renaissance in nuclear power, as well as responding to a rising China, would be advanced considerably by sustaining federal innovation investments. Instead, the incoming administration proposed [PDF] massive, across-the-board cuts in the Department of Energy’s FY26 R&D budget. (See Table 1.) It also sought to pull back billions of dollars for large-scale, first-of-a-kind demonstration projects that were funded with bipartisan support in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

In the bipartisan, bicameral package released last week, Congress took a more reasonable approach. It reduced the total cut in federal energy R&D spending to just 2.6 percent, compared to 32.5 percent proposed by the president. It transferred a small portion of unexpended infrastructure funding to annual appropriations. This accounting maneuver allows budget hawks to claim a minor victory while preserving the bulk of energy infrastructure funding for future investment, rather than returning it to the treasury. Nuclear energy R&D (increased 23.5 percent), not surprisingly, did much better than energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D (reduced 11.3 percent) in the final bill. (The main demonstration program for nuclear power, which is not included in these figures, will also receive a bump in FY26.) Such incremental adjustments are consistent with historic shifts in partisan control of the federal government, not a radical break from the past.

The budget outcome echoes that of OB3. That massive tax and spending bill [PDF] cut incentives to deploy mature energy technologies, notably solar and wind, but it retained or expanded them for many emerging low-carbon energy technologies, including geothermal, nuclear, carbon capture, and advanced energy storage. OB3 passed with only Republican votes, yet many of the policies it reaffirmed had previously been included in bills passed by Democrats in the prior Congress.

More From Our Experts

The bipartisan compromise expressed in the FY26 budget and OB3 is far from ideal. A recent report [PDF] from Clean Tomorrow calls for a sustained expansion and significant realignment of federal investment in energy R&D to meet the Chinese challenge to U.S. leadership. Nonetheless, by refusing to cede control of energy innovation policy to hardcore budget cutters in the executive branch, Congress has preserved key foundations that would allow such growth to resume in the future, such as national lab and academic infrastructure, science and engineering students and faculty, clean energy start-ups, and corporate research labs.

The next step for Congress will be to ensure that the Trump administration executes its policy in good faith. Oversight and accountability should be the watchwords, particularly in light of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought’s refusal to acknowledge legislative primacy in matters of taxing and spending. Congress’s reassertion needs to have practical, not merely rhetorical, effect if U.S. energy innovation policy is to fulfill its potential.

Meta will purchase more than 2.1GW of energy through 20-year agreements covering two Ohio plants – Perry and Davis-Besse – along with capacity expansions at these facilities and a third site at Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania.

The uprates will add 433MW of new capacity to the PJM grid region in the early 2030s.

""This agreement is beneficial in many ways – it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located,"" says Jim Burke, who is President and CEO of Vistra.

All three facilities feed into the PJM interconnection, the regional transmission organisation that coordinates electricity across 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Backing next-generation reactor designs

Meta's agreements with TerraPower and Oklo are slightly different in that they target those more advanced nuclear technologies that remain unproven at commercial scales.

The TerraPower deal provides funding for two Natrium units capable of generating up to 690MW, with delivery anticipated as early as 2032.

Meta has also secured rights to energy from six additional Natrium units producing 2.1GW, targeted for 2035 delivery.

The eight potential units would provide 2.8GW of baseload generation capacity plus 1.2GW of built-in storage.

""This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,"" explains Chris Levesque, TerraPower's President and CEO.

Chris noted that the company has completed its design, established supply chains and cleared key regulatory milestones for its first Natrium plant currently under development.

Ohio campus could deliver 1.2GW

The Oklo partnership focuses on Pike County, Ohio, where an advanced nuclear technology campus could come online as early as 2030.

The project aims to add up to 1.2GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market.

Multiple Aurora Powerhouse reactors would be constructed on the site, with Oklo's designs based on fast-reactor technology capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

""Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,"" says Jacob DeWitte, Oklo's co-Founder and CEO.

The projects collectively promise thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent operational positions across Ohio and Pennsylvania.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c7f20c6b8b918cd72e60fc149f69ba43:bd3a5a8cd7716a8c293c8f3646acb3f3/02-oklo-carousel-02.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:13:32.728864

This month’s update covers major congressional action on permitting reform and defense authorization, alongside significant developments in critical minerals investment, clean energy tax policy, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and federal energy regulation. From the House’s passage of the SPEED Act to FERC’s intervention on AI data center interconnections, these updates highlight how energy, national security, and technology policy will continue to converge in the new year, along with broader geopolitical events.

House Passes Permitting Reform Legislation

The House passed the SPEED Act, a sweeping overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by a 221-196 vote. Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill, while one Republican voted against it. During committee markup, Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) worked with lead Democratic co-sponsor Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) to add language making it harder for future presidents to revoke permits for energy projects of all types, an effort aimed at broadening Democratic support.

That compromise, however, sparked backlash from hardline Republicans, who argued the provision would “undermine” the Trump administration’s efforts to curb offshore wind development. To secure GOP votes, party leaders weakened the measure, prompting the American Clean Power Association and several Democrats to withdraw their support. Despite those defections, the bill ultimately cleared the House.

The changes may complicate negotiations with the Senate, though. Any broader bipartisan deal is likely to extend beyond NEPA to include reforms to the Clean Water Act to ease pipeline permitting — a key Republican priority — as well as provisions to facilitate interstate transmission development, which Democrats view as essential for bringing clean energy onto the nation’s power grid, but which House Republicans have so far resisted.

Further complicating the passage of the SPEED Act, and potentially killing any momentum for the foreseeable future, the White House halted construction of all US offshore wind projects three days before Christmas. While consistent with President Trump’s disdain for offshore wind, it will likely further erode Democratic and even some Republican support for the bill. It could also make Republicans vulnerable going into midterm elections in 2026, when electricity prices and general questions of electricity supply will likely be in focus.

NDAA Passes Congress

Both chambers of Congress passed the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing $901 billion for national security programs — $8 billion above the president’s budget request. The legislation includes several provisions with significant implications for energy, critical minerals, and industrial policy.

The Defense Industrial Base Fund is expanded to allow the Secretary of Defense to invest across defense supply chains, including materials, components, finished products, testing and qualification, infrastructure, facility construction and improvement, and equipment — explicitly encompassing critical minerals, materials, and chemicals. The bill also directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency, to expand recovery and reuse of strategic and critical materials under the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program.

In addition, the NDAA establishes an Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs to oversee a new Arctic Watcher Program, aimed at strengthening US energy security, cybersecurity, and economic interests in the Arctic, particularly in critical minerals and natural resources.

The bill updates covered technology categories for the Office of Strategic Capital to include nuclear fission and fusion energy technologies, extends the Defense Production Act through September 30, 2026, and reauthorizes the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) through 2031.

The DFC reauthorization significantly expands the agency’s authority, raising its investment cap to $205 billion — an increase of more than 300% — creating a $5 billion equity revolving fund, and allowing equity investments of up to 40% minority ownership. The legislation also expands geographic eligibility to all countries except the wealthiest 20, while maintaining limited investment authority in those countries through Five Eyes partnerships and select sectors, including energy, critical minerals and rare earths, and information and communications technology such as undersea cables. No more than 10% of the DFC’s maximum contingent liability may be used in wealthy or high-income countries.

Wind and Solar Tax Credit Lawsuit

A coalition of tribal, environmental, local, and consumer groups filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Columbia challenging Trump administration rules that make it more difficult for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. The suit argues that new Treasury Department guidance unlawfully changes how the start of construction is determined for wind and solar facilities — eliminating the long-standing 5% safe harbor in favor of a stricter physical-work requirement — while leaving other technologies unaffected, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Led by the Oregon Environmental Council, the plaintiffs contend the rules unfairly discriminate against renewable energy, threaten investment and jobs in the wind and solar industries, and will reduce clean energy capacity, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. The lawsuit seeks to have the guidance declared arbitrary and capricious and vacated, as part of broader opposition to Trump administration efforts to roll back Biden-era clean energy policies.Treasury declined to comment on the litigation, and the IRS stated it does not comment on pending cases.

FERC Orders PJM to Revise AI Data Center Interconnection Rules

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, to develop new rules governing how loads, such as artificial intelligence data centers, connect to the electricity grid when they are co-located with power generators. FERC found PJM’s proposed co-location tariff to be “unjust and unreasonable,” citing a lack of clarity and consistency in rates, terms, and conditions for both generators serving co-located load and transmission customers.

The commission directed PJM to establish new transmission service options, with proposed terms expected early this year, and to submit a report by January 19, 2026 addressing reliability concerns associated with determining the amount of new capacity that is needed to maintain system reliability. The ruling is expected to influence FERC’s broader approach to the Department of Energy’s proposed rule to accelerate data center interconnections, which has drawn more than 160 public comments. With regard to the Department of Energy’s proposal, FERC Chair Laura Swett said FERC is actively reviewing the proposal and will move “as quickly as we can once we are ready.”

DOE Advances the Genesis Mission

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced agreements with 24 organizations to collaborate on the Genesis Mission to advance US artificial intelligence innovation, following responses to a recent request for information and ongoing project partnerships with DOE and the national laboratories. Participating organizations include major technology and AI leaders such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anthropic, Cerebras, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Oracle, Palantir, xAI, and XPRIZE, among others.

DOE also noted that two related RFIs remain open: “Partnerships for Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models” through January 14, 2026, and “Transformational AI Capabilities for National Security” through January 23, 2026.

Continued Critical Minerals Investments

The Trump administration is backing the construction of a $7.4 billion zinc smelter in Tennessee as part of a broader push to expand domestic critical minerals production through direct federal investment. Under the agreement, South Korea’s Korea Zinc will acquire the only operating primary zinc smelter in the United States and construct a new, modern facility capable of processing 13 different critical and strategic minerals beginning in 2029.

The project will be partially financed through a $1.9 billion joint venture involving investment from the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital. The deal follows South Korea’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States as part of trade negotiations aimed at avoiding higher US tariffs.

Houston is the only major city in Texas without a solid waste fee.
In addition to improving waste services, a solid waste fee incentives citizens to reduce waste production and utilize reusable items in their everyday lives.
PAYT is a type of solid waste fee that works like a utility bill.","Houston’s solid waste system is broken. In 2025, over 85,000 complaints have gone to 311 for missed trash, heavy trash, and recycling pickups. Missed pickups are ranked as one of the top five service requests to 311. Our recycling rate is estimated to be just 16%. That is 16 percentage points below the national average of 32%. And every year, millions of tons of waste, including single-use plastics, end up in landfills or as litter in our bayous and parks.

One major reason? Houston spends only about half as much per household on waste services as cities like Dallas and San Antonio. That translates to lack of manpower and lack of equipment to address waste pickup and processing, which is a problem Houston has notably had for years.

We need more staff, more pickup trucks, more transfer stations, and more public education campaigns on recycling to meet the needs of Houstonians and achieve our zero waste goals. While we applaud the efforts of the current city administration to improve services by temporarily employing contractors for garbage pickup and increasing the amount of pickup trucks for solid waste collection, these efforts are not enough to fully address Houston’s trash problem.

By adopting a solid waste fee, Houston can finally invest in proven solutions–reliable curbside collection, stronger recycling programs, composting, and waste reduction initiatives. Houston is the only major city in Texas without a solid waste fee. Council Member Sallie Alcorn’s “Your Two Cents” survey, in collaboration with Rice University, found that around two-thirds of respondents would support an increase in taxes or fees to better fund essential city services, and about two-thirds would specifically pay some type of garbage fee. With those investments, we can cut pollution, clean up our streets and bayous, and get Houston back on track to meet its zero waste goals.

In addition to improving waste services, a solid waste fee incentives citizens to reduce waste production and utilize reusable items in their everyday lives. Cities have reported an average trash reduction of 28% after implementing a “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT) fee. PAYT is a type of solid waste fee that works like a utility bill. The more you throw, the more you pay, and the less you throw, the less you pay.

We want to fix Houston’s solid waste system, not break it further, which is why we are also calling an end to “chemical recycling.” Houston partnered with petrochemical companies to promote this so-called chemical recycling. But let’s be clear—that’s not real recycling. These facilities burn plastics, pump more pollution into our air, and keep us locked into dependence on single-use plastics. 2025 has proven that chemical recycling is a failing industry as facilities are continuously closed down due to lack of return, yet there are still attempts to expand on these unstable economic projects. Houstonians deserve better.

That’s why we’re bringing Houstonians together to demand that our city invest in the waste and recycling system we deserve. Included below are some highlights.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_610569836-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:00:35.595729

U.S. SENATE News:

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, delivered remarks on the Senate floor on how the Trump administration’s actions to cancel and stall energy projects are killing jobs, skyrocketing electric bills, and threatening permitting reform.

The speech comes as Donald Trump has suspended every permit for offshore wind projects and stalled the permits of more than 500 clean energy projects – exacerbating our nation’s energy affordability crisis.

“Any permitting deal is going to have to guarantee that no Administration of either party can weaponize the permitting process for cheap political points. By raising electricity prices and killing American jobs, this Administration has made it crystal clear that they are not interested in permitting reform, or bringing down the price of energy,” said Ranking Member Heinrich. “The bottom line is this: The Trump Administration needs to follow the law, they need to reverse their illegal stop work orders, and they need to start approving legally compliant energy projects. Full stop.”

Expanding E15 access is one of the most immediate and practical ways to address this imbalance. When fully scaled, year-round, nationwide E15 is poised to create new domestic demand for billions of bushels of corn and sorghum, help stabilize markets, support farmers, and deliver consumer savings at the pump.”

The letter was led by Growth Energy, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association.

In recent years, the organizations noted, E15 availability during the summer driving season has depended on temporary emergency waivers. While these annual actions provide short-term relief, they are not a sustainable or reliable solution.

Year-to-year uncertainty discourages investment in fuel infrastructure, confuses consumers and undermines confidence among retailers and refiners.

A recent study found that nationwide, year-round E15 sales would add up to $25.8 billion to the U.S. GDP, generate up to $10.3 billion in household income and support more than 128,000 new full-time jobs across the country.

“With a record corn crop filling bins across America, farmers cannot afford another season of uncertainty and negative margins,” the groups wrote. “Markets need consistency and predictability, which requires permanent legislative action by Congress. We respectfully urge you to act this year to pass year-round E15 legislation.”

The groups said year-round E15 legislation would ensure the record corn and sorghum crop finds a stable domestic market and would provide consistent access to lower-priced E15 fuel for consumers nationwide. This legislation would remove an outdated regulatory barrier and deliver economic growth across rural America, while also strengthening America’s energy security and reducing emissions, the groups said.

Grab your red fedora and trench coat, because The Morning Dump is a global affair today. From the hallowed halls of Congress, I’ll whisk you off to the hippy hills of California, where the state is hoping to keep its EV dreams alive.

I’ll then take you south of the border, down Mexico way, where Volkswagen is claiming the United States isn’t holding up its end of the USMCA. And, finally, it’s off to Europe, where China and the EU seem to have come to terms on what to do about the sudden influx of cheap cars to the continent.

Rockapella voice: Where in the world is… The Morning Dump?

It’ll Get Interesting For Used EV Buyers In 3-4 Months

Back in 2022, then-President Biden and then-WV Senator Joe Manchin managed to sneak the Inflation Reduction Act through a Congressional backdoor. Did it meaningfully reduce inflation as the name promised? Not in any obvious way. Did it dramatically increase inflation as some warned? No, not that either. It’s just a political name to describe something that had way more to do with creating green jobs and incentivizing EV production and purchases than with inflation.

Most, though not all, of the Inflation Reduction Act was Uno-Reverso’d by the One Big Beautiful Bill, including the provision that provided $7,500 off for the purchase of specific electric cars. Because America’s European and Asian allies freaked out a little bit about this (this was back when the White House cared about having European and Asian allies), the Biden White House carved out an exemption big enough to drive a Kia EV9 through.

Specifically, the law said the $7,500 could apply to any commercial vehicle, whatever the country of origin. The IRS interpreted a lease as a commercial vehicle. Senator Manchin freaked out about this, but ultimately, the lease exemption stayed.

As you can see in the chart above, anything that’s orange is a leased vehicle. I wrote about this before, but for most automakers, leasing was how they moved electric cars. Most leases are 24 or 36 months, which means that there’s going to be a point where all of these leased electric cars are going to get returned. Courtesy of the Q4 Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index Call presentation, you can see exactly when that’s going to start:

Those green vehicles are leases being returned, and the dark blue ones are PHEVs. As you can see, starting in approximately April of this year, the market is going to start getting flooded with potentially up to 40-50k used EVs every month.

Granted, many people could buy out their leases, but I think this is probably not a great idea for most lesees. As outlined before, our advice has always been to lease a new EV or buy a used one. The argument to lease has mostly gone away, but the idea of buying a used one still makes a lot of sense.

It’ll be a case-by-case basis, but for it to make sense for someone to buy out their electric car lease, a consumer will have to love the car and have either previously negotiated a buy-out price that reflects the significant depreciation that’s occurred, or be able to negotiate that again. I suspect that as more, say, used e-trons and Polestars get dumped on the market, used car values will drop further.

There are potential counterweights here. The lack of affordability in the market and the likely increase in electric car costs might balance it out a bit. Overall, this represents a great opportunity for someone to get a potentially good used EV at a great price. I suspect a lot of these vehicles will be CPO as well, which brings some peace of mind.

As an example, here’s a Hyundai Ioniq 6 with just 16,000 miles for just over $25,000 with tons of warranty left and even more on the battery/motor. I’d keep an eye on vehicles like the Ioniq 6, the MachE, et cetera. Also, this isn’t going anywhere. It may start in April, but it’ll continue on for the next 24-36 months.

The one caveat here is that I would check to see if the vehicle was used as rideshare car, as these tend to get charged up to 100% more frequently in my experience and may have a lower battery life. (Though modern batteries seem to be holding up well).

Will California Give You A Discount On A Used EV?

California has pledged to continue its own statewide EV tax rebate plan, setting aside $200 million for on-the-hood discounts. It’s not clear how long it’ll last, and it’s not clear if that’ll also work for used EVs purchased at a dealership.

USA Today has a little more:

California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Lauren Sanchez said in an exclusive interview with USA Today that her state is stepping up to offer EV tax credits because “the rest of the global market is moving toward” Zero Emission Vehicles, despite the backsliding in the level of federal support under Trump.

Sanchez said embracing EVs is “point of pride in California” because “a third of EV sales are in California.”

Under California’s previous EV tax credit program, which ran from 2013-2024, the state spent $1.49 billion to cover credits for 586,000 vehicles, according to CARB.

Asked specifically about used EVs, Sanchez told USA Today that “The team is taking a hard look at how we can [sic] a used incentive work.”

Fingers crossed for folks in the EV market.

Volkswagen: This Isn’t Fair

This is hard to quantify, but the sense that I get from most automaker execs–whatever their own personal politics–is that they don’t want to upset the President while also avoiding seeming political in a way that might upset people who disagree with the administration. It’s not worth it. Tesla’s CEO being so obviously political is likely to cost Tesla hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars.

One of the big sticking points between automakers who sell cars in the United States and the White House is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This was a modification to NAFTA, and it continued the idea of a trade zone between the three countries. It was also a major policy of President Trump in his first term. President Trump doesn’t like the deal anymore and has clearly tried to discourage continued production in these countries, and most automakers have adjusted by trying to announce big projects in the United States while trying to take advantage of some transitional offsets.

Volkswagen is not one of those automakers. It has a huge footprint in Mexico and is saying the quiet part out loud as the Associated Press reports:

Though some in the auto industry have privately suggested that Trump’s tariffs amount to violations, companies have been hesitant to issue public positions saying so. Instead, they have mostly stuck to questioning the merits of Trump’s actions while also offering constructive recommendations on how U.S. trade policy should proceed.

That trend largely continued in a series of letters filed this week by automakers, suppliers and trade groups regarding the USMCA’s automotive rules of origin provisions. The Trump administration previously solicited broader comments on the trade deal in November, but the latest request for comments was for autos only.

Volkswagen, amid falling U.S. sales, was more critical of the Trump administration than industry competitors in its public filing. Europe’s largest automaker pleaded for tariff relief and requested that existing USMCA rules not be made stricter after the review.

I don’t know that this means that VW is exactly joining the Resistance alongside the Fed Chair and, uh, Wine Moms, but it’s a notable difference from most carmakers.

China And The EU Are Friends Again, Sort Of

As anyone who reads TMD regularly knows, Chinese automakers created a huge production capacity for EVs. There aren’t enough consumers in China to absorb all that demand, so it’s been trying to export cars. This is good for markets where no one makes cars, as those folks get cheap EVs. Everyone else? Not so much, so the EU slapped high tariffs on Chinese importers.

The Chinese government got mad and threatened to make French wine and other random things expensive. Now, according to the European Union, there’s a plan that should make everyone happy enough.

In its “Guidance document on submission of price undertaking offers” document, the EU offers up a plan whereby automakers will set a reasonable “Minimum Import Price” (MIP) that will counter the impact of subsidization. How will this be determined?

Based on the CIF prices of the exporter in question in the investigation period of the proceeding leading to the imposition of the measures, increased by the relevant margin of the countervailing duties imposed.

Basing the MIP on the non-subsidised EU-produced BEV’s sales price in the Union of the same product type (or closely resembling, appropriately adjusted for physical differences), which includes Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A) and a reasonable margin of profit.

It’s complicated. For the moment, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU seems cool with it:

The China Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (CCCEU) warmly welcomes and highly commends the positive outcome achieved through dialogue and consultations between China and the European Union, which has enabled a soft landing in the electric vehicle case. This important result responds directly to strong concerns from the business community, including the automotive sector. It not only supports the healthy and stable development of China–EU trade, investment, and bilateral relations, but also sends a clear and strong signal to global markets that both sides remain firmly committed to managing differences through dialogue and consultation, and to jointly upholding a rules-based multilateral trading system and an open global economy.

Given all of the above involving the United States and its trade position, expect China to continue to fill the EV demand left by the United States in various places around the world.

Energy is the backbone of our economy and our way of life. From powering homes to fueling businesses, reliable and affordable energy keeps America moving forward. But today, outdated permitting rules are blocking the very projects we need to secure our future. Regulations that were designed to provide a fair process have turned into roadblocks. Instead of delivering better outcomes, they now drive up costs, stall job creation, and leave families footing the bill.

On average, major energy projects take more than six years to secure approval. Some transmission lines have been delayed as long as seventeen years. During that time, demand keeps rising, infrastructure keeps aging, and costs keep climbing. Transmission congestion alone cost American families $11.5 billion in 2023. Those costs show up in monthly utility bills and in lost opportunities for new jobs and investment.

Every state feels these challenges. In the Southeast, families have watched their power bills surge nearly 24 percent for households and 19 percent across all sectors in just the past decade. Families and businesses are paying more, while projects that could deliver cleaner, cheaper power are stuck in line. The result is a system where energy consumers pay the price of government inaction.

***

Permitting delays no longer make projects safer or cleaner. They simply make them more expensive and less certain. Developers spend years navigating duplicative reviews and endless litigation, often without a clear end in sight. This uncertainty discourages investment, slows innovation, and means fewer new projects break ground. At the same time, consumers lose out on the lower costs and greater reliability that come when competition and new supply are allowed to flourish.

The stakes are only getting higher. America’s energy demand is growing rapidly. Expanding industries like data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electric vehicles are adding new load to an already strained grid. Without timely upgrades to transmission and generation, costs will rise, reliability will suffer, and our ability to compete globally will weaken. We can’t afford to let red tape hold us back.

That’s why permitting reform is essential. A smarter, more predictable system would:

Set clear timelines so reviews can’t drag on for years without resolution.

Reduce duplication by designating a single lead agency to oversee major projects.

Focus reviews on major projects while letting routine, low-impact ones move quickly.

Prevent endless lawsuits by establishing fair but limited opportunities for judicial review.

These reforms won’t weaken environmental protections. They’ll simply make the process work. Americans deserve both strong environmental stewardship and an energy system that is affordable, reliable, and secure. With clearer rules and faster decisions, we can have both.

Permitting reform is about more than paperwork. It’s about lowering costs for families. It’s about creating jobs through new projects and infrastructure. And it’s about strengthening America’s energy independence so we’re never at the mercy of foreign supply chains or aging infrastructure.

We’ve always been a nation that builds. From railroads to highways to pipelines, our infrastructure has powered our growth and secured our future. But today, the greatest obstacle to building isn’t technology or resources, it’s bureaucracy. Red tape is holding America back at the exact moment when we need to unleash our full energy potential.

By cutting through the gridlock and modernizing our permitting system, Congress can deliver real results: affordable electricity, reliable power, secure supply, and new jobs. Families want it, businesses need it, and our future depends on it.

Permitting reform is not just a policy debate, it’s a national necessity. The time to act is now. Let’s fix permitting, unleash American energy, and secure a stronger future for every state.

The Senate on Jan. 7, by a 50-43 vote, rejected a motion to proceed to consideration of a bill (S.J. Res. 86), sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), that would have voided an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule issued in August that approved South Dakota’s revision of its plan for implementing the EPA’s rule governing regional haze levels and visibility at national parks such as Mount Rushmore. Whitehouse said the approval was part of a Trump administration effort “to tear down the protections of Americans’ health and safety and our environment.” An opponent, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), said: “Overturning EPA’s approval would force the state to adopt unnecessary pollution control measures, despite clear evidence that they would not meaningfully improve visibility.”

Kaine said Congressional oversight of military actions in Venezuela was necessary because of signs “that this will go on for a long period of time. The seizure of oil, the dictation of terms about elections and the politics of Venezuela will go on for years.” A bill opponent, Sen.

Advanced nuclear power can deliver that.”

Those words are not from an energy executive, a Trump Administration official, or a Chinese leader whose country is rapidly deploying nuclear power. Rather, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said them in a July 24, 2025, Op-Ed in USA Today.

Governor Hochul’s comments reflect one of the most important and under-reported aspects of energy policy: there is broad, bipartisan support for nuclear power, especially new forms of it, and the realization that it should be deployed quickly.

Presidents Biden and Trump agree on this, as do the vast majority of Members of Congress from both parties.

While many on the left snipe at fossil fuels and many on the right are critical of renewables, especially industrial-sized windmills, nuclear power has quietly built strong support. It remains the largest provider of emission-free power in the United States and has operated safely for nearly 70 years.

As part of a May 29, 2024, White House summit promoting new forms of nuclear energy, the Biden White House said, “a new generation of nuclear reactors is now capturing the attention of a wide range of stakeholders for nuclear energy’s ability to produce clean, reliable energy and meet the needs of a fast-growing economy.”

President Biden also led the push to enact the Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, which passed Congress by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and was signed into law on July 9, 2024. A central provision is to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors that have been developed and extensively evaluated.

Turning this support into the actual building of new nuclear facilities is now the chief challenge, and the Trump Administration is addressing it decisively and effectively.

For years, all forms of new energy construction in the United States have been impeded by red tape, significantly raising project costs and, when built at all, increasing costs to consumers.

Nowhere has this been more pronounced than in nuclear power, where just three new U.S. nuclear plants have come online in more than 25 years. This, despite the fact that commercial nuclear power has an impeccable safety record in the U.S., with no one dying a radiological death since the first plant went online in 1957.

On the President’s first day in office, he declared a national energy emergency, emphasizing the need for more energy in part to help the U.S. prevail in our AI competition with China. On May 23, President Trump issued an executive order to accelerate the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)’s testing of new nuclear reactors.

Following through on this, on August 12, the DoE announced it had selected 11 advanced reactor projects to move their projects towards deployment, with the goal of having three up and running by July 4, 2026. Importantly, DoE is also working closely with the prestigious Idaho National Laboratory to, it says, help “domestic reactor developers by resolving many technical and licensing issues that are generic to SMR technology.”

These steps are necessary because of the promise of new nuclear power and a long track record of historic delays in approvals and even decisions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These newer, smaller reactors are inherently safer than today’s larger reactors and have been extensively studied and tested.

Meanwhile, China is strongly expanding its use of nuclear power. According to the World Nuclear Association, 70 nuclear reactors are under construction worldwide, with 34 of them in China. In December, China also announced it would begin commercial operation of the first SMR in the first half of 2026. It will provide power for the island province of Hainan.

The U.S., meanwhile, should aim to have a bevy of new nuclear reactors operating and providing commercial power by 2028. Furthermore, major investments in new nuclear power by large technology companies, such as Amazon and Google, are offering the promise of lower-cost, clean, and highly efficient power.

The reality is that China is winning the energy race, and we need to catch up. We need regulators to decide whether to license projects and to continue inspecting and monitoring them. For denied applications, regulators should provide clear reasons so applicants can consider changes that are likely to receive approval.

For decades, the U.S. was the world’s unquestioned, preeminent leader in nuclear energy. The sooner we return to that position, the better for our economy and our people.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/691121_6_.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 14:16:09.064578

California Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking for $200 million to restart offering tax rebates for electric vehicles that are purchased in the state, making up for a similar federal program that President Donald Trump ended last year.

The proposal would require approval from state lawmakers, who are set to negotiate the broader California budget ahead of a July deadline.

Details on the new program, including the amount of individual rebates and which cars would be eligible, are still being discussed, said Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Buckley said in an email.

Newsom has gone back-and-forth on using California resources to backfill the federal EV tax credits Trump cut. An initial 2024 proposal had market-share caps that would have excluded Tesla Inc.’s best-selling models, drawing the ire of Elon Musk who called the plan “insane.” The proposal was later dropped as California’s budget gap widened, with Newsom then saying that the state “wouldn’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

California is the biggest EV market in the country and Newsom’s proposal could be a boon for struggling manufacturers.

Tesla and other automakers reported slowdowns and declines in electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter after the loss of federal incentives, following a rush from EV buyers taking advantage of an expired $7,500 federal credit.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, applauded Newsom’s proposal saying he “made clear that California will move forward forcefully with our clean energy and climate progress.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2026-01/EV-charging-getty-1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:00:02.542986

Rep. Chris Smith announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded $1.5 million in federal funding to the Ocean County Utilities Authority (OCUA) for a major wastewater treatment infrastructure improvement project.

The funding was secured through a congressional earmark Smith included in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 118-42). The funds will be used to replace and upgrade Primary Digester No. 2 at the Ocean County Utilities Authority’s Central Water Pollution Control Facilities, which serve Ocean County and parts of southern Monmouth County.

Smith said the project is intended to improve the longevity, durability, and reliability of the region’s wastewater treatment system. He added that the upgrades will help enhance environmental protection, operational efficiency, and the safe treatment and disposal of wastewater and related byproducts for both residential and commercial customers.

The congressman noted that the federal investment also helps return taxpayer dollars to New Jersey’s congressional district and supplements Ocean County’s capital expenditure budget for critical infrastructure needs.

Smith further stated that the $1.5 million allocation represents the first phase of federal support for the facility. A second earmark, totaling approximately $1.1 million, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives this week as part of the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act of 2026.

If the additional funding is approved by the U.S. Senate, Smith said the second tranche would become available sometime next year.

“Clean water infrastructure is essential,” Pallone said. “These investments help prevent environmental hazards, protect public health, and ensure that communities like Asbury Park and Perth Amboy can meet today’s challenges without pushing costs onto local taxpayers.”

The funding secured by Pallone includes $1 million for a new screenings system at the City of Asbury Park’s Wastewater Treatment Plant. The project will filter out debris that lead to system failures, helping the city avoid discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, particularly during the busy summer season when failures can disrupt tourism and pose environmental risks.

“On behalf of the City of Asbury Park, I want to thank Congressman Pallone for supporting this important project and recognizing the need to improve infrastructure at the city owned wastewater treatment facility. This project will directly improve efficiency of operations at our facility and help to protect our ocean and beaches,” said Mayor John Moor.

A separate $1 million allocation will support improvements at Perth Amboy’s Runyon Water Treatment Plant. The project will strengthen the plant’s ability to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in local water sources and help the city comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for managing those contaminants.

“This funding supports the long-term improvements we are already making to Perth Amboy’s water system. Upgrading the Runyon Water Treatment Plant will strengthen our ability to meet federal standards and ensure our residents continue to have safe, reliable drinking water. It’s a responsible investment in public health and in the future of our city’s infrastructure, and we appreciate Congressman Pallone’s support in helping move this work forward,” said Mayor Helmin J.

In 2025, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) supported communities recovering from Hurricane Helene, took actions to address PFAS contamination and continued to protect the state’s natural resources for the health and prosperity of all North Carolinians.

The monumental task of helping communities recover from Hurricane Helene, while rebuilding in a way that makes them more resilient to future storms, played a central role in the Department’s actions last year. In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 12 months on helping North Carolinians recover from the hurricane.

Link to By the Numbers

Aiding recovery, resiliency in WNC

In addition to the highlights below, DEQ focused during the past 18 months on helping North Carolinians recover from Helene:

Awarded $365 million in grants for water infrastructure repairs and resiliency.

Mapped 4,000 landslides, helping North Carolinians stay safe from future slides.

Inspected 400 dams.

Awarded $12 million to clean up debris in streams and rivers.

Designated 177 debris collection sites.

In 2025, DEQ received the first federal funding through EPA to improve flood resiliency to drinking water, wastewater and septic systems affected by Hurricane Helene. The Division of Water Infrastructure received $685 million in supplemental funds and has completed two funding rounds using these funds to date.

The Dam Safety Program established the North Carolina Dam Safety Grant Fund in accordance with House Bill 1012 (SL2025-26), making $10 million in state funding available to dam owners for the rehabilitation and/or removal of Hurricane Helene damaged high-hazard dams.

In August, EPA awarded DEQ a $61 million grant for Hurricane Helene State Program Support for Hazardous Waste Management. The grant will run through Sept. 30, 2030, and will assist North Carolina with emergency response and recovery from Hurricane Helene. It also will fund preparations for emergency recovery as related to DEQ’s hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, recycling and materials management, emergency response programs and pesticide management.

DEQ created the Western NC Recovery Grants Program that provides free, customized grant writing support to local governments and partner nonprofits in Western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene. The program objective is to help impacted communities secure federal and state funding for long-term recovery projects.

NC Geological Survey staff mapped more than 2,600 landslides resulting from Hurricane Helene and responded to more than 400 landslides.

The NC General Assembly allocated emergency disaster recovery funding to DEQ’s Underground Storage Tank Section (UST) to assist owners and operators with testing and repairing tanks that store petroleum and hazardous substances and were damaged by Hurricane Helene. The program provides temporary financial assistance for emergency services until owners receive federal disaster relief funds or insurance reimbursements. Loans are interest-free and mature upon the earlier of receiving federal disaster relief or other funding, or by June 30, 2030. As of November, DEQ had received 11 loan agreements for more than $1.2 million.

DEQ received an EPA grant (with state matching funds) totaling more than $15.8 million to assess and cleanup spills of petroleum from USTs damage by Hurricane Helene. The grant will run through March 31, 2030, and can be extended an additional two years. The UST section has identified more than 15 sites that may be eligible for funding. Assessment or corrective action is underway at nine facilities. Evaluation of additional sites is ongoing.

The Division’s Solid Waste Section approved 177 sites for temporary management of debris from Hurricane Helene. The section also worked with regional officials and residents to manage the debris.

In the aftermath of Helene, the Asheville Regional Office assisted by the Winston Salem Regional Office conducted more than 400 dam safety inspections.

The State Energy Office (SEO) launched a $5 million Clean Energy Microgrid Initiative to deploy small solar-powered microgrid systems in areas that lost power due to Hurricane Helene. As of December, five microgrid sites had been selected and materials were being purchased.

DEQ received the first federal funding for onsite decentralized wastewater to support Hurricane Helene recovery. The $22.5 million EPA award is currently open for applications through the Division of Water Infrastructure until March 2, 2026, and funds the replacement and repair of septic systems in a 39-county region of WNC.

DEQ awarded a $10 million grant to MountainTrue, an Asheville based nonprofit, to clean up debris from 125 miles of streams. Funding from DEQ has allowed the organization to hire 79 workers, who removed an average 10,000 pounds of debris from Western NC waterways daily.

Investing in Communities and Building Resiliency

In 2025, the State Water Infrastructure Authority awarded more than $877 million in loans and grants to update and harden drinking water, wastewater and septic systems, limit chemical pollution (PFAS), replace lead pipes and assist towns damaged by Hurricane Helene while improving resiliency for future storms.

The State Resilience Office (SRO) joined DEQ in July to support resilience-building statewide. The SRO, previously at the N.C. Department of Public Safety, supports local governments and their partners to plan for and invest in resilience initiatives. The SRO also manages the NC Resilience Exchange, an online toolbox of resilience resources and staffs the Interagency Resilience Team, a partnership of state agencies working to promote resilience efforts across state government.

SRO, in partnership with the State Climate Office, kicked off its second Planning for Extreme Heat Cohort Program. Nine local governments from the coast to the mountains participated in the program with the goal of developing a local heat action plan. Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related impact.

In January, SRO published the NC Resilient Communities Planning Guide to help local leaders, especially local governments, plan for a more resilient future in their communities. This two-volume tool guides users through the process of understanding their vulnerabilities and developing a project plan to address them.

The NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint program awarded $25.2 million to projects in 16 counties to build more resilient communities and protect lives, property and livelihoods across North Carolina. The program, through partnerships with agencies such as the NC Land and Water Fund, NC Emergency Management and the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, funded more than 73 projects valued at more than $78 million in total. The total investment from the Blueprint program for these initiatives amounted to over $34.4 million, demonstrating a highly efficient use of state resources where program dollars are working twice as hard through leveraged funding.

The Blueprint Tool, posted in April, serves as a resource for communities, local governments and partners by providing accurate, data-driven flood-risk and vulnerability assessments.

The Blueprint released its first progress report in March.

The NCGS brought in record external funding this year with 11 grant projects totaling more than $2 million. The projects cover an array of topics from foundational geologic mapping needs to critical minerals and rare earth element studies to data preservation.

In 2025, the Division of Mitigation Services (DMS), initiated 14 new mitigation projects that will permanently protect approximately 97 acres of wetlands along with nearly 20 miles of stream and 91 acres of riparian buffer. These projects represent an investment of approximately $59 million to restore and protect natural resources in North Carolina. DMS currently manages 206 active and ongoing mitigation projects.

In 2025, DMS received mitigation credit releases valuing more than $40 million. In addition, 29 projects were closed out resulting in:

16.2 miles of stream restored and protected

174.2 acres of wetland restored and protected

92.66 acres riparian buffer area restored and protected

20.92 acres of Nitrogen and Phosphorous nutrient offset

In 2025, DMS assisted 235 development projects by taking responsibility for 270 new mitigation requirements including:

58,206.6 stream credits

80.9 wetland credits

1,367,513.8 riparian (streambank) buffer credits (equivalent to 31.39 acres)

6,388.45 Nutrient Offset Nitrogen credits (equivalent to 2.8 acres)

3,514.7 Nutrient Offset Phosphorus credits (equivalent to 24 acres)

DMS and Ecosystem Planning and Restoration completed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for the existing and future conditions (after implementation of flood mitigation projects) of the Stoney Creek watershed. The Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program’s first pilot project, a stormwater wetland basin on the Wayne Community College campus in Goldsboro, was completed in December. Construction on a second natural infrastructure project in the Stoney Creek watershed should begin in early 2026.

The State Energy Office’s Weatherization Assistance Program completed work in 1,380 households, including repairing or replacing 543 heating units and weatherizing 838 homes.

SEO reached agreement with three weatherization agencies for a combined contract value of more than $33 million to begin delivery of weatherization services with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in four of the seven program regions.

The $208 million Energy Saver North Carolina program Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs launched Jan. 16, 2025, which includes the Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) rebates.

As of December, the program processed applications in 98 of the North Carolina’s 100 counties. Residents in Mecklenburg and Wake counties can apply beginning in January 2026.

2,600 North Carolinians completed an application.

Approximately $650,000 rebates paid.

An estimated 293,000 kilowatts annually saved.

Households participating in the program will realize an estimated annual average savings of $945.

SEO selected nine projects to receive $2.79 million in Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants. The projects will reduce energy usage and lower costs for local governments, state agencies and universities.

Seven subawardees were selected for nearly $20 million in funding to improve North Carolina’s electric grid: the City of Wilson, Duke Energy Carolinas, Fayetteville Public Works Commission, Four County Electric Membership Corporation (EMC), Surry Yadkin EMC, Tideland EMC and the City of Gastonia. The request for proposals for the next funding round of about $9.7 million will be released in 2026.

The Utility Savings Initiative saved $159 million in avoided utility costs in fiscal 2024–25 and a cumulative $2.26 billion in avoided costs since fiscal 2002–03 by using efficiency improvements across state facilities.

The Division of Air Quality (DAQ) awarded $1.91 million for new public electric vehicle chargers across North Carolina, filling gaps in the state’s charging network along highways and in rural communities. The projects will prevent more than 657 tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere and will avoid 125 pounds of nitrogen oxide emissions and 1,191 pounds of volatile organic compound emissions.

DAQ awarded $1.14 million in grants for clean vehicle projects, including more than $270,000 for new all-electric vehicles. These awards are projected to eliminate 3,483 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 57 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 7,700 pounds of fine particulate matter emissions.

The Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) received $26 million in EPA funding in October for grants to local communities in western North Carolina to improve recycling operations damaged by Hurricane Helene and to conduct recycling and waste management workshops for disaster preparedness.

DEACS awarded $1.17 million (plus $1.11 million in matching funds) in recycling grant funding to 19 businesses and 15 local governments for projects that are expected to create 31 jobs and divert 25,000 tons of material from landfills annually.

DCM’s Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP) awarded $6 million to 32 communities across coastal North Carolina. A total of $1.9 million was allocated to cover technical assistance in risk assessment and resilience planning, as well as incorporating resiliency into Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) Land Use Plans. Grants totaling more than $4 million were awarded to communities to support engineering, design and construction.

DCM’s Public Beach and Coastal Waterfront Access Program awarded more than $2.25 million in grants to support 10 projects that will expand and improve public access to North Carolina’s beaches and coastal waterways. The next round of funding for this program will be announced in January 2026.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service awarded a $1 million coastal wetlands grant to DCM for the purchase of The South End at Topsail Beach. This is the final portion of the total $8 million that was required for the conservation of this ecologically rich barrier island property. The South End consists of more than 100 biodiverse acres of salt marsh, maritime forest, dune and beach on a dynamic ocean inlet. The NC Coastal Land Trust will execute the purchase and transfer the property to DCM, which will maintain it as a public access area in cooperation with the town of Topsail Beach.

DCM received $227,833 in funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program, which provides funding to marinas and other boating facilities for outdoor recreation. The funding will allow staff to training opportunities.

The Division of Water Resources awarded more than $2.6 million in grants to support stream restoration, water-based recreation and water management projects across North Carolina. The total includes nearly $2.3 million awarded through two different grant cycles of the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects fund, and $350,880 to support two stream restoration projects on agricultural lands through a cost-sharing program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

DWR awarded more than $9.39 million for five projects in coastal North Carolina for beach and dune renourishment. There were five projects that received funding from the Coastal Storm Damage Mitigation Fund, which is funded by the N.C. General Assembly through Session Law 2023-134 for costs associated with beach nourishment, artificial dunes and other projects to mitigate or remediate coastal storm damage to the ocean beaches and dune systems of the state.

DWR awarded more than $5.8 million in grants in funding from the Flood Resiliency Blueprint to support projects that provide flood reduction or flood resiliency benefits across the following six river basins across North Carolina: Cape Fear, French Broad, Lumber, Neuse, Tar Pamlico & White Oak basins. The grants were awarded to 10 local governments through a one-time appropriation of flood resiliency funding received through the NC Flood Resiliency Blueprint administered through the Water Resources Development Grant program state and local projects program.

Protecting North Carolinians from Forever Chemicals

DEQ continues to lead on addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in North Carolina, guided by the Action Strategy for PFAS. DEQ continues to work on limiting PFAS discharges to the environment, protecting public health and addressing remediation efforts to clean up existing PFAS contamination. The Division of Waste Management (DWM) continues to direct Chemours Co. Fayetteville Works plant to sample private wells and provide alternate water as warranted based on results. DEQ has also required Chemours to expand sampling to an area that now encompasses 10 counties.

The Bernard Allen Memorial Emergency Drinking Water Fund, administered by DWM, continues to notify persons whose private wells are at risk of PFAS contamination, test private wells for PFAS and provide alternate drinking water to owners of wells contaminated by PFAS. The program sampled 414 private wells for PFAS and provided drinking water to 113 residences in the past fiscal year. Requests for sampling of private wells continue to increase.

DWM’s Solid Water Section has required all permitted sanitary landfills to sample their facilities’ groundwater monitoring networks for PFAS and has directed facilities to update receptor surveys and sample private wells and provide alternate water when applicable. The majority of DWM programs are directing drycleaning facilities, pre-regulatory landfills, permitted hazardous waste facilities and inactive hazardous facilities to evaluate PFAS effects and where applicable direct these facilities to complete updated private-well receptor surveys and provide alternate water where applicable.

DEQ’s Division of Water Resources worked with Sampson County Disposal LLC to develop a special order of consent that requires SCD to begin testing groundwater and water runoff from the Sampson County Landfill for PFAS and eventually reduce the compounds by 90%. Sampson County Landfill is the first landfill with a proposed direct discharge that will install an advanced treatment system designed for PFAS removal.

DWR’s Public Water Supply Section staff coordinated with DWI to hire a contractor to develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan that has been submitted to EPA for approval. The plan will allow Federal Emerging Contaminants Small and Disadvantaged Community Grant funds to be used by DWM and the PWS Section to collect hundreds of samples to test for PFAS in drinking water and provide technical assistance to affected communities.

DWR’s Groundwater Resources Branch completed its initial round of statewide groundwater PFAS sampling of a statewide network of groundwater monitoring wells. DWR has incorporated additional follow-up PFAS sampling into the branch's routine sampling process.

DWR, at the request of the Environmental Management Commission, developed proposed rules that would establish industrial users discharging wastewater at publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities (POTWs) and direct dischargers to perform for one year baseline monitoring for three PFAS compounds: PFOS, PFOA and GenX. Dischargers that have results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the PFAS compounds. POTWs will submit to DWR annual reports on the activities of significant industrial users. Industries will continue water sampling and following plans until the three PFAS compounds cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

At the request of the Environmental Management Commission, DWR developed proposed rules to minimize 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA has identified as a likely carcinogen. The rules would require large industrial users discharging wastewater for treatment at POTWs and direct dischargers that likely have 1,4-dioxane in their wastewater perform baseline monitoring for the compound for one year. Dischargers showing sampling results greater than the lowest reported level would be required to continue sampling and develop a plan to reduce or eliminate 1,4-dioxane. Industrial practices will be summarized, and POTWs will submit annual reports to DWR. Industries will continue water sampling until the compound cannot be detected in wastewater discharge.

Additional accomplishments

DAQ released an update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a continued trend of declining air pollution emissions and improved air quality. In August, North Carolina celebrated being in compliance with every federal health-based air quality standard for 10 consecutive years, which benefits public health and the economy. Among the 20 most populous states in the U.S., North Carolina has the longest running streak of being in statewide attainment with the standards.

For the second time in its history, DAQ recorded no exceedances of the ozone air quality standard during the year.

DAQ upgraded the Air Quality Portal’s public mapping tool, the Ambient Information Reporter. Improvements include a new Air Quality Index layer, measuring fine particulate data and a better display of surface visibility data.

DWM’s Brownfields Redevelopment Section celebrated the 750th Brownfields Agreement at a site known as Brown School, which has been transformed into an affordable housing community called the Brown School Lofts at Legacy Heights.

DEQ’s environmental education program hosted 30 livestreamed talks with top researchers and educators in partnership with the NC Museum of Natural Sciences that reached more than 7,000 viewers this year. The talks are broadcast on YouTube and shared with schools, universities and colleges, state agencies and the public.

In 2025, 46 educators achieved the NC Environmental Education Certification, a nationally recognized professional credential managed by the DEQ in partnership with various state agencies. The program saw strong growth with 92 new enrollments, with both classroom teachers and nonformal educators pursuing their certification. To earn the certification, participants must commit to 200 hours of professional development, community leadership and instruction.

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program team submitted to EPA its Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which details 14 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and presents ways to reduce statewide emissions by 50% by 2030 from the 2005 baseline, and attain net-zero by 2050.

The Department submitted an updated NC Energy Security Plan to the Department of Energy that included new sections on critical infrastructure and cross-sector dependencies, emergency preparedness and response, energy sector threats and impacts, a risk assessment, and risk mitigation and coordination.

The NC Geological Survey digitized about 500 geophysical well logs and created an online viewing tool, allowing for easier and deeper analyses without specialized software.

The NC Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) Study and Evaluation Tool was completed in association with Applied Weather Associates in May. The PMP replaces outdated values provided in hydrometeorological reports. The study relies on the most current practices for defining PMP, including comprehensive storm analyses procedures, extensive use of geographical information systems, explicit quantification of topography and coastal effects, updated maximum dew point and sea surface temperature climatology for storm adjustments, and improved understanding of weather and climate related to extreme rainfall in the region.

Nearly 40 experts attended two workshops held by the Coastal Reserves program to develop habitat resilience plans for the Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island reserves. Attendees addressed habitat vulnerability and risk, research, monitoring and solutions. The Masonboro Island Reserve workshop yielded a list of 41 research and monitoring needs to foster future resilience at the site. Products from the Zeke's island Reserve workshop are under development.

DCM’s Local Permit Officer Program held a two-day workshop in May for 60-plus officers in central and southern sites and in October for Northern/Northeastern officers. The workshops included field trips to Manteo and Swansboro and included presentations by Division staff and other state and federal agencies representatives, rule updates, hands-on training in the field and dialogue/discussions with questions and answer sessions.

DCM celebrated the 40th anniversary of the state’s National Estuarine Research Reserve, designated by the state and NOAA to protect special places in the state, including the Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke’s Island Reserves. This designation inspired the state to later create the umbrella N.C. Coastal Reserve, which is authorized by the N.C. Coastal Area Management Act.

Across all reserve sites, the total value of DEQ’s volunteer program was $38,374.13. (1,340.75 reported volunteer hours valued at $33.01/hour.) 500-plus pounds of marine debris removed by volunteers.

DMF, in cooperation with the NC Department of Information Technology and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, put into effect Dec. 1 new harvest reporting requirements for recreational and commercial fishermen.

DMF’s Observer Program launched in February the automated Observer Trip Scheduling System, which schedules observer trips for Estuarine Gill Net Permit holders. The Division worked with the N.C. Department of Information Technology and volunteer commercial fishermen to develop the system, which is a requirement of North Carolina’s Endangered Species Act Section 10 Incidental Take Permit.

Otherwise, the progress achieved in installed renewable capacity could be undermined by unresolved structural constraints.","Renewable energy sources now represent 65% of installed power generation capacity across Latin America and the Caribbean — a historic milestone for the region’s energy transition.

However, this does not mean that renewables deliver the same share of electricity in real time. The gap between installed capacity and effective generation remains one of the most significant technical challenges facing the regional power system.

According to the regional electricity market monitoring report, renewable generation reached 71% of total output in June 2025, with hydropower alone contributing 51%. Yet in July — during the dry season — this figure fell to 65% or lower.

This seasonal variability highlights that, at certain times of the year, the system still needs to rely on fossil fuel-based technologies such as natural gas and fuel oil to guarantee security of supply.

For Antonio S.R. Lopez, CEO of A&M TECHNOLOGY, the discrepancy between installed capacity and actual generation is structural rather than temporary.

“Installed capacity figures do not always translate linearly into the electricity delivered to the system,” he explained, stressing that the most pressing gaps lie in energy storage, limited operational flexibility, and the need for more accurate resource forecasting.

Lopez also warned that existing transmission infrastructure must be strengthened to sustain high levels of renewable generation under all weather conditions.

Price exposure to fossil fuels remains

From an economic perspective, the region has yet to overcome its exposure to fossil fuels. Spot electricity prices continue to be anchored to thermal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output, regional congestion or demand peaks.

While renewables help to cushion price volatility, they have not yet fully decoupled electricity prices from gas and fuel oil. According to the regional report, achieving genuine price decoupling will require:

Greater energy storage capacity

A more flexible power grid

Upgraded regional transmission infrastructure

Ancillary services markets that properly value the technical attributes of renewable generation

2026: a turning point for system operation

Demand projections towards 2026 present a new operational challenge for the regional power system. Although most new generation is expected to come from renewable sources such as solar PV and wind power, the absence of structural solutions — particularly storage and flexibility — could turn this growth into a critical operational bottleneck.

Lopez was clear in his assessment:

“Renewable expansion will be the main driver, but without storage and flexibility, system operation will not be sustainable.”

Regional integration through the Mercado Eléctrico Regional (MER) could play a key role in addressing these challenges. The MER already enables more efficient dispatch, cost reductions and enhanced energy security through cross-border electricity trading. However, its current architecture was not designed to manage the variability of intermittent renewable sources.

At an operational level, further regulatory adjustments are still required to integrate ancillary services, improve dispatch mechanisms and enable the participation of distributed energy resources. While renewables have expanded the potential for regional energy integration, limited transmission capacity has become a major constraint on absorbing large and variable power flows.

Lopez concluded that market design must evolve so renewable resources can be fully integrated — not only from a technical standpoint, but also commercially and economically. Otherwise, the progress achieved in installed renewable capacity could be undermined by unresolved structural constraints.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Energia-Estrategica-56.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:40.362389

The key difference between hybrids and EVs is that the decision to build them is market driven.
Automakers should hurry to make hybrids the inevitable future transportation technology before the power pendulum in Washington swings to bring back the zero-emissions crowd.","The following editorial originally appeared in The Detroit News:

The auto industry is headed back to where it should have stayed in the quest to put a cleaner fleet on the road: hybrids. Automakers are rapidly backing away from plans to fully electrify their offerings, due to an easing of fuel economy and emissions mandates by the Trump administration and continued resistance from consumers.

But that doesn’t mean they are totally abandoning their green ambitions. Rather, most manufacturers are making the commonsense decision to expand the hybrid market. They are putting more hybrid models in showrooms and continuing to perfect the technology to achieve greater fuel efficiency.

That’s what they should have done in the first place. But government regulators bowed to the demand from environmentalists for a 100 percent switch to zero-emissions vehicles on a pace that ignored consumer wariness and the practical challenges to going all electric.

Hybrids were the first step away from traditional internal combustion engines. They enjoyed consumer confidence and did not require a complete remake of the vehicles that motorists were used to driving.

And best of all, they didn’t need a new national charging network. Because they have both a gasoline engine and electric motor, they can fuel up at existing gas stations.

Perhaps they made too much sense. But the industry, with Washington’s hand on its back, largely blew past hybrids and committed billions to developing and building EVs.

Practicality is now prevailing. Sales of hybrids were up 20 percent in the third quarter of 2025, according to analytics firm PwC, and the surge is expected to continue this year.

Most automakers have revamped their strategy to get as many hybrids as possible in showrooms, as soon as possible. Toyota, which never abandoned hybrids, is selling its popular Sienna and Camry brands only in hybrid versions. General Motors, which not so long ago was committed to an all-in EV strategy, is reintroducing plug-in hybrids.

It’s all good news for consumers. EVs carry an average sticker price of $59,200, compared with $47,500 for a hybrid. And in the U.S. market, there are currently 87 hybrid models to choose from.

While not as fuel efficient as an all-electric vehicle, they still reduce fuel costs by roughly 35 percent compared to standard gas-powered models, and you can drive them wherever you want without the charging anxiety that haunts EV drivers.

Some motorists prefer EVs, and they aren’t going away. But America has always needed a vehicle for the masses, and hybrids adequately fill that role in today’s transportation mix.

The key difference between hybrids and EVs is that the decision to build them is market driven. Automakers should hurry to make hybrids the inevitable future transportation technology before the power pendulum in Washington swings to bring back the zero-emissions crowd.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:05.693666

But speakers at a morning panel moderated by Alliance executive director Frank Sesno noted remarkable progress despite wavering American commitment.
Despite a coordinated public disinformation campaign, however, public opinion continues to be in favor of action on climate change.","The George Washington University’s Alliance for a Sustainable Future joined the Embassy of France to cohost “Paris Climate Agreement 10 Years On: What’s Changed, What’s Next?” last month, a summit exploring global progress and setbacks since the legally binding international treaty was signed by 195 countries in 2015. The event also marked the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, which had ended a few days before.

“Ten years after the Paris Climate Agreement, the science is clear and the stakes are growing ever higher,” GW President Ellen M. Granberg said at the summit, pointing out that the World Meteorological Organization records nine of the 10 hottest years on record as occurring in the last decade, and that by 2050 the world’s population is likely to reach nearly 10 billion, all of whom will require food, energy and water.

The launching of the Alliance at GW in 2023 reflects the demand for international, multidisciplinary solutions to these complex challenges, Granberg said. And its impact is concrete: Students and faculty from the Alliance and from GW’s Sustainability Research Institute were on the ground at COP30, “working alongside local leaders to shape the next phase of climate policy.”

“Our students are acutely aware that the planet is at risk and that they need to be change agents, and I am so proud of all they are doing to make a difference…They represent the essential role universities play in advancing solutions and GW's commitment to scholarship that leads to action.”

Hundreds of diplomats, scientists, experts and on-the-ground leaders, including GW students, faculty and staff, gathered at the summit to assess the decade and discuss what's been accomplished and what lies ahead.

The adoption of the Paris Agreement “was universally acknowledged as a major diplomatic breakthrough [and] was considered an example of what cultural multilateralism can achieve at its best,” French Ambassador Laurent Bili said, recalling “the enthusiasm and positive energy that was felt at the time.”

In the years since, progress has been mixed. Local and international actions have likely averted the most pessimistic climate change scenarios, and Bili pointed to “spectacular progress in the areas of affordability and renewables.” But the international community is likely to fall short of the agreement’s central goal—limiting average global temperature increase to under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels—making continued action urgent and necessary.

“Inaction is not an option, and I'm glad that we have students in the audience who are ready to take on the fight for a sustainable future,” Bili said.

The United States’ withdrawal from the agreement (which would be echoed, weeks after the summit, by withdrawal from the bedrock 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and President Donald Trump’s denial of climate change hovered over the daylong conversation. With China and India, the U.S. is one of the planet’s top three greenhouse gas emitters and therefore one of the most important players in meaningful carbon reduction.

But speakers at a morning panel moderated by Alliance executive director Frank Sesno noted remarkable progress despite wavering American commitment. The science around global carbon monitoring has improved, climate models are more refined, and some steps toward fossil fuel reduction have meaningfully progressed, including increased global use of renewable energy like wind and solar, decreased costs for these energy sources and a widening market share for electric vehicles. More and more, climate adaptation is being viewed “not just as a cost but as an investment that in the long term actually pays off,” said panelist Pierre Gentine, professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University.

In the U.S., local jurisdictions now stand on the front line of that investment. Speakers Charles Allen, Ward 6 member for the D.C. City Council, and Serena C. McIlwain, Maryland state secretary of the environment, discussed the practical impact of the Paris agreement in their regions and the ambitious climate agendas they and their colleagues have championed in the capital region.

Locally, the “economic momentum” of adaptation “is undeniable,” McIlwain said, noting that dozens of companies have launched clean energy operations in Maryland from which thousands of jobs are projected to develop. “Clean means the economy wins too.”

In a keynote address, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the only elected federal official to attend COP30, pointed to the cozy relationship between the Trump administration and the fossil fuel industry as jeopardizing climate adaptation and, by extension, American lives. Despite a coordinated public disinformation campaign, however, public opinion continues to be in favor of action on climate change. Whitehouse pointed to polling that showed 74% of respondents supported making corporations pay for harm caused by their pollution, with just 10% opposed.

“So here's a political issue that has a 64% positive margin for us—what’s not to like about that?” he said. “But in order to animate that, we've got to take advantage of it. We've got to make sure we are making that argument loud and clear and without hesitancy.”",https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5401/files/styles/large/public/2026-01/paris_climate_agreement_10_years_2025_wla_an0a6230.jpg?itok=NS2vjW6y,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:46.497465

The negotiations had to weather the efforts of some countries to water down language of certain resolutions, difficulty agreeing the budget for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the absence of the United States from many discussions.

As well as a declaration signed by environment ministers, 11 resolutions were adopted at this the seventh UN Environment Assembly (UNEA7), which is held biennially in Nairobi, Kenya. These concerned issues including protecting coral reefs as the ocean warms, cleaner management of minerals and metals, and addressing a “massive influx” of sargassum seaweed in the Atlantic Ocean.

Recommended

Tanzanian delegate Richard Muyungi is chair of the Africa Group of Negotiators, which represents 54 African countries at the UN climate negotiations. He emphasised the importance of UNEA7 achieving agreement on UNEP’s strategy for 2026-2029, which included the 2026-2027 programme of work and budget. That amounts to USD 1.1 billion to be distributed among UNEP’s programmes, an increase on the 2024-2025 budget of USD 869 million.

Muyungi, whose country is rich in minerals and forests, said the meeting “gives us a sense of how the global community is ready to work with our continent to address the challenges we are facing: whether it is climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, ocean acidification or the loss of coral reefs.” He added: “The outcome will inform in the longer term how we can better manage our environment in Africa while ensuring sustainable development”.

Multilateralism under strain

UNEP’s executive director, Inger Andersen, acknowledged to Dialogue Earth that multilateralism is under strain but was bullish.

“What’s the alternative to multilaterialism?” she said. “UNEP has been actively promoting environmental conservation for over half a century, and despite the recent change of direction of some countries, the markets are talking.” She gave the example of Texas, “an oil-producing state that has invested in renewable energy covering the supply of 40% of its electricity demand.”

Andersen said that while the UN and the multilateral system are not moving fast enough, they are trying to speed up. She noted the importance of synergies among multilateral agreements. Nineteen conventions are represented at the UNEA, on topics from chemicals to wildlife trade and plastics.

“I rarely engage with science deniers – we’re a scientific agency – but I would tell them that the price of action today is cheaper than with a 2.3C global warming scenario,” she said. Andersen drew on some of the key messages contained in the 7th Global Environment Outlook report which was launched at UNEA7. An update on the one published in 2019, it contains clearer science, particularly on the scourge of plastics for human health and the environment.

Plastics treaty revival: ‘If you’re not on the table, you’re in the menu’

UNEA7’s ministerial declaration, which closed the negotiations, anounced broad actions to promote international environmental governance.

It mentioned the resolution on ending plastic pollution, adopted by UNEA in 2022. Andrés Del Castillo, senior attorney at the Geneva-based Center for International Environmental Law, noted the “very ambitious language” of that resolution, which seeks to control pollution throughout plastics’ life cycle.

Del Castillo said the declaration, which was signed by all UNEA member states except the US, “emphasises the commitment to continue the negotiation process for the plastics treaty … within the UN system.”

But he believes geopolitical forces will make environmental governance challenging in 2026. Though ambitious countries are beginning to make many concessions, the other side is less generous, he says, especially on the issue of plastics.

He celebrated the adoption of the 2026-2029 strategy but warned of the strings attached regarding gender and human rights. A group of countries whose economies strongly depends on fossil fuels had only approved the strategy on condition UNEP dropped its recognition of the connections between human rights, gender and the environment.

“UNEP’s room for manoeuvre has been restricted,” he said. “The head of the agency will be constrained by a new agenda that is trying to limit the intersections between human rights and the environment.” However, the ministerial declaration does include a mention of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, Del Castillo noted.

He believes the US will most likely continue to engage in the plastics negotiations, as requested by its manufacturing industry. This is despite the country saying in Nairobi that it had “made a considered decision to step back from negotiations on all UNEA resolutions, decisions and the ministerial declaration.” On 7 January, the US also announced its withdrawal from 31 UN bodies, though it remains a formal member of UNEP.

Del Castillo concluded: “In diplomacy there’s an old saying – if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”

Progress on sargassum: A win for West Africa and the Caribbean

One of the resolutions approved at UNEA7 focussed on a proposal by the Dominican Republic, and endorsed by Barbados, Jamaica, Ghana and Sierra Leone, to strengthen a global response to sargassum blooms in the Atlantic.

Record volumes of this floating seaweed reached the Caribbean and West Africa in 2025, badly impacting tourism and marine ecosystems.

July 2025 set a new record of 38 million metric tonnes for the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, 70% higher than the previous record set in July 2022. According to experts, this may be primarily due to warmer ocean water and stronger winds in spring.

Claudia Taboada, the Dominican Republic’s sole delegate at UNEA7, said some countries had tried to undermine efforts to get the sargassum resolution passed. Environmental multilateralism is being deliberately eroded, she said. “Having a [resolution] that refers to a ‘severe escalating socio-economic and environmental issue’ is … less powerful than calling it a ‘crisis’.”

“Questioning science, reopening already closed consensuses and relativising issues such as the special circumstances of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) is not a technical difference. It is a political strategy that puts years of progress at risk,” she told Dialogue Earth. “Allowing language manoeuvres to empty our collective decisions of content is unacceptable.”

The adoption of the resolution does, however, represent “a first step towards placing a global interest on the sargassum crisis … and a high-level discussion which will allow us to return reloaded to UNEA8 with an implementation progress report, and hopefully with a political landscape more favourable to our region’s interests.”

A call to accelerate action

Tabi Joda is an ecosystem revivalist and lead of the One Billion Trees for Africa initiative. He travels across the Sahel – a semi-arid region bordering the Sahara Desert – to coordinate reforestation efforts. The initiative can provide environmental services and economic opportunities to communities fighting desertification, he explains.

Desertification such as in the Sahel is creating conflicts and driving migration, as herders and farmers compete for scarce water and pastures.

“We could have a mosaic of biodiversity that would allow for social cohesion, we just need spaces like UNEA to move from mainstream topics to those that have a real impact, like our project in the Sahel,” said Joda.

His call to include more Indigenous knowledge and practices to support science connects with the conservation efforts of Wanjira Maathai, managing director for Africa and global partnerships at the World Resources Institute. She says the health impacts of air pollution are forcing African governments to act, while also putting women closer to decision making.

But her organisation’s annual State of Climate Action report shows the world is off track on all 45 indicators on climate action.

Amermin notes that critical materials and minerals are crucial for modern life and are used across nearly every industrial sector, including defense, nuclear power, energy, aerospace, agriculture, construction, healthcare and technology. However, the company adds that these materials often are mined in foreign countries at a high cost, putting pressure on the global supply chain and forcing reliance on volatile trading partners and nations with “substandard” mining regulations.

“We appreciate the DOE’s confidence in Amermin to establish a reliable domestic source of critical materials and minerals, addressing important supply chain and national security issues,” Amermin CEO Ryan McAdams says. “This funding will enable Amermin to increase the output of tungsten carbide by 300 percent through the expansion of our state-of-the-art tungsten carbide reclamation facility, reducing our country’s reliance on foreign nations like China, which produces 83 percent of the world’s tungsten supply. We know that America’s future depends on access to critical materials, and together we are charting a new path in American innovation.”

Amermin says it specializes in tungsten, copper, nickel, cobalt and graphite processing, returning those materials to manufacturing specifications and extending their life cycles.

The company, founded in 2017, tells Recycling Today it plans to use the DOE funding to scale operations and expand its footprint at its 80-acre campus currently under construction in Briggs, Texas. The company says it expects the expansion—which includes increased metallurgical laboratory capabilities and additional processing lines—to be complete in the second quarter of this year.

To date, McAdams says Amermin and its sister company, Drill Bit Exchange, have recycled more than 56 million pounds of material sourced from a variety of industries, such as energy, oil and gas, aerospace, defense, manufacturing, technology, construction and automotive. In particular, Amermin’s capabilities include proprietary electrochemical processing, mineral/metal concentration, refining, sizing and blending.

The grant was awarded to Melt Technologies L.P., which does business as Amermin, an asset recovery and processing business. Amermin is a sister company to Drill Bit Exchange, which provides asset recovery solutions for the drill bit industry.

“I am thrilled that Amermin was selected and approved by the U.S. Department of Energy to increase its production of critical minerals, directly aiding American oil and gas producers,” says U.S. Rep.

Federal Employee First Amendment Lawsuit Advances

Right of Federal Workers to Engage in Off-Duty Activism at Stake

Washington, DC — A federal district court judge has rejected a government effort to dismiss a free speech lawsuit brought by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) on behalf of a federal employee who was threatened with criminal prosecution and disciplined for engaging in environmental advocacy on her personal time. The case now proceeds to litigation on the merits with the judge having already ruled against the agency’s interpretation of the legal questions at stake.

The employee, Carolyn McConnell, is a field attorney with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) based in Seattle. She is also a leader of a non-profit conservation group advocating for protection of national parks and forests in the Pacific Northwest. After she co-authored an op-ed supporting national park staffing, the NLRB declared that her activities constituted a conflict of interest and requested that she be criminally prosecuted. After the U.S. Attorney declined prosecution, the NLRB threatened Ms. McConnell with disciplinary action if she persisted in her public advocacy, even though McConnell’s advocacy was completely unrelated to her work for the NLRB.

In a ruling handed down on January 8, U.S. District Court Judge James L. Robart rejected the NLRB’s motion to dismiss McConnell’s suit, ruling that the agency had misread a federal conflict-of-interest statute and that she had validly claimed that its action “places a significant burden on her First Amendment rights.” Although the judge ruled based on a standard that puts McConnell’s allegations in the best light, it seems likely that he’ll make the same findings on the merits given that the case presents few if any factual disputes.

“We welcome this ruling, which comes at a time when the rights of federal employees are under siege,” stated PEER Staff Counsel Colleen Zimmerman. “Federal workers do not surrender their rights to speak out as a condition of entering public service.”

In this case, the court relied on a prior case bought by PEER more than 20 years ago involving an electrical engineer from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based in Las Vegas who faced similar agency threats for his off-duty advocacy for desert tortoises. Today under the Trump administration, some federal employees have been fired or suspended for exercising their free speech rights. Currently, PEER is leading a legal challenge to the termination of several EPA employees because they signed a public letter of dissent.

“This case has broad implications for all federal employees and everyone in this country,” said PEER Senior Counsel Paula Dinerstein. “If the government prevails in this case, it will give license to the current administration to silence and intimidate public servants who want to engage in civic activities outside of their work.”

“I became a public servant because I care about the public good. Like all my fellow federal workers, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, and I won’t be intimidated from continuing to stand up for my constitutional rights and the rights of all federal employees,” McConnell said.

Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience.
Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.","Moving from fossil assets to green assets will bring local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.

Hawai‘i is the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation. We rely on oil for about 65% of our electricity and spend billions of dollars annually on it.

This dependence has resulted in high electricity and transportation costs and exposure to supply and price volatility. This vulnerability underscores why clean energy should be framed as a fight for energy independence. Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Political scientist Jessica Green argues that climate politics is really a competition with trillions of dollars at stake. Fossil fuel asset owners are incentivized to delay the transition to protect their investments. Vulnerable asset owners face the consequences of climate change, e.g., property losses and higher insurance costs. Green asset owners are stakeholders whose assets gain value as the transition accelerates. We must consider these dynamics to accelerate progress.

Hawaiʻi already has many green asset owners. We have thousands of households with rooftop solar benefiting from reduced energy costs, owners of over 40,000 EVs on our roads converting gas to local electricity spending, and electric grids with 36% to 50% renewable energy. Importantly, electricians, installers, auditors, mechanics, engineers, and operators are also asset owners.

Our main fossil asset owner is Par Pacific, through its refinery and fuel distribution network. But it is already evolving, with part of the Kapolei refinery being converted to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines in 2026. This is what a practical transition looks like and an example of how fossil fuel assets can be repurposed while protecting our workforce and economic capacity and increasing energy independence.

Clearly, much more must be done to achieve our energy future. Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience. Each solution must perform its specific job well, prevent undesired consequences, and work with others so that the transition becomes self-reinforcing.

Here are a few priorities for our government and business leaders to consider in 2026:

Priority 1: Standardize and streamline permitting and modernize interconnection. This will speed up deployment of common projects (e.g., rooftop solar, EV chargers, batteries), prevent yearslong project delays for large grid-scale projects, and enable innovation in clean, firm power.

Priority 2: Scale green loans, rebates, and tax credits for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Incentivize the transition with close attention to our low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

Priority 3: Accelerate fleet electrification by deploying EV charging infrastructure and basing procurement on total cost of ownership, not just purchase price. This will ensure that our transportation goals are met and build general momentum for the transformation of our ground transportation system.

Priority 4: Fund workforce development programs to avoid worker capacity bottlenecks in clean tech, create career opportunities for our youth, and build economic resilience.

Priority 5: Create a carbon dividend program using our barrel tax. This would direct revenue to households, with additional support to those most exposed to energy price increases. This would protect households, provide businesses with certainty, and encourage investment in energy efficiency and clean transportation.

Priority 6: Publish a quarterly scorecard (with state, county, and utility inputs) to track progress on relevant metrics, e.g., rebate utilization, permit processing times, interconnection queue metrics, fleet and charger deployment, and household energy and fuel cost index.

Many of these changes can leverage federal grants, bonds and service-based delivery arrangements that don’t require upfront capital. Households and businesses can use PACE financing, solar leases, and community solar to convert capital expenditures into monthly energy and transportation costs at or below what they already pay.

We have a choice: the fossil asset corner, which means reliance on energy imports and vulnerability. Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi. The choice is clear.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/02/25135544/east-maui-windmills-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:51.227350

That is hospitality.” Reimagining hospitality at Texas A&M Texas is one of the fastest-growing states for travel, tourism and service-based industries, which made Goodwin a natural partner as the College expanded hospitality education.
Working with faculty and former students, Goodwin helped develop a plan that led to the creation of the Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in 2023.
“This is going to be the front door of Texas A&M,” Goodwin said.
“We are building something that will make Texas A&M the place to study hospitality, hotel management and tourism,” Goodwin said.","Drive through Aggieland, and you will see them everywhere: black and green signs that read “Oldham Goodwin.” They mark hotels, apartment communities and office buildings that have become staples in the community. Behind those signs is Hunter Goodwin ’96, a former Texas A&M University tight end whose second career as a real estate developer has kept him closely tied to the place that shaped him.

Goodwin’s company has helped fuel local growth, but his impact reaches much further. Through his support of the Arch H. Aplin III ’80 Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Goodwin is helping build opportunities for students who want to lead the next generation of the hospitality industry.

He sees it as an extension of what he learned at Texas A&M: Service and leadership go hand in hand.

“Hospitality is about people,” Goodwin said. “That is what Texas A&M taught me. You serve others, you lead with integrity, and you make a difference wherever you are.”

An Aggie foundation

Goodwin grew up in Bellville, a town small enough that Friday night football brought everyone together. When he arrived in College Station, the scale was bigger, but the sense of community felt the same.

“When I came to A&M, it just fit,” he said. “The people and the place felt right.”

He played football under Coach R.C. Slocum, learning lessons in discipline and teamwork that carried him through nine seasons in the NFL. Off the field, professors in the Department of Agricultural Economics showed him how to think about business through a human lens.

“I had professors like Dr. John Nichols and Dr. Ed Rister who didn’t just teach, they mentored,” Goodwin said. “Those relationships still matter to me today.”

However, it was a class with Ivan Schmederman ’67, Ph.D., that set his career in motion. A guest lecture by real estate broker John Schneider introduced him to the field, and something clicked. “I remember thinking: This is what I want to do,” he said.

Building opportunity

After the NFL, Goodwin returned to College Station with his wife, Amber ’97, to put down roots and start the next chapter. In 2004, he partnered with fellow Aggie Casey Oldham ’02 to form the Oldham Goodwin Group. What began as two people with an idea is now a company of more than 500 employees with projects across Texas.

“We wanted to create something that built opportunity for people,” Goodwin said. “If you drive around and see those black and green Oldham Goodwin signs, that is what they represent. They stand for growth and a belief in this community.”

The company’s work spans commercial, multifamily and hospitality properties, but at its core, Goodwin said, it is about service.

“Every project we take on affects people,” he said. “Our job is to create spaces where they can live, work or stay comfortably. That is hospitality.”

Reimagining hospitality at Texas A&M

Texas is one of the fastest-growing states for travel, tourism and service-based industries, which made Goodwin a natural partner as the College expanded hospitality education. Communities across the state need professionals who understand management, service and experience-based leadership.

“The idea was to build something that prepared students for the world they are stepping into,” Goodwin said.

Working with faculty and former students, Goodwin helped develop a plan that led to the creation of the Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism in 2023. This reformulation of the Department of Recreation, Park and Tourism Sciences capitalized on its legacy while positioning the program to meet the growing needs of Texas.

“Hospitality fits naturally with who we are as Aggies,” Goodwin said. “We teach leadership and service, and that is what this industry is built on. It is about creating experiences that make people feel valued.”

The department’s new identity has sparked momentum. Enrollments have grown by about 30% to reach almost 500 over the past year, new degrees have launched, incorporating paid internships, and partnerships with industry leaders are giving students hands-on experience before they graduate.

“As Dr. John Crompton told me, our biggest challenge now is managing success,” Goodwin said. “That is a good challenge to have.”

A hub for hospitality innovation

In the fall of 2025, the department updated its name to officially become the Arch H. Aplin III ’80 Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management and Tourism, in honor of Texas A&M former student and Buc-ee’s founder Arch H. “Beaver” Aplin III ’80, whose gift is helping advance hospitality education at Texas A&M.

The department’s rapid growth will soon take center stage at the new Aplin Center, made possible through a gift from Aplin. The facility will serve as both a hospitality teaching hub and the university’s official visitor center.

“This is going to be the front door of Texas A&M,” Goodwin said. “It is where people will experience who we are before they see anything else.”

The Aplin Center will feature teaching kitchens, event and retail spaces and learning labs where students will connect classroom knowledge to real-world operations. For Goodwin, it represents what hospitality is all about.

“When people think of agriculture, they often think of crops or cattle,” he said. “But hospitality is agriculture too. It is about food service and connecting people. It is about caring for others.”

Goodwin continues to work closely with department head Brian King, Ph.D., to develop industry partnerships and expand student opportunities.

“We are building something that will make Texas A&M the place to study hospitality, hotel management and tourism,” Goodwin said. “And it is happening in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.”

Leading by example

Even as his company grows, Goodwin’s priorities have stayed the same. He believes in showing up, giving back and setting the tone for others to follow.

“I was raised to believe that if you have been blessed, you give back,” he said. “Time is the one thing we all have the same amount of and giving it to others is the best thing you can do.”

He mentors students and young professionals across the College, encouraging them to combine knowledge with purpose.

“You do not have to be the loudest voice in the room,” he said. “You just have to be the one people can count on.”

Those same lessons drive his team at Oldham Goodwin.

“When we manage a hotel or develop a property, our goal is simple,” he said. “We want to make someone’s day better. That is hospitality, but it is also the Aggie way.”

Carrying the tradition forward

For Goodwin, the Aplin Department of Hospitality captures the best of Texas A&M: tradition, service and the drive to do meaningful work.

“Hospitality is about creating moments that matter,” he said. “It is about making people feel seen and valued. That is what Aggies do.”

Through his company and his continued involvement with the College, Goodwin is helping shape a department that develops both skill and character.

“Our graduates will go out and lead in every corner of this industry,” he said. “They will make people proud to say they learned it here.”

So, those black and green signs are about more than just business. They represent a story of service, community and a belief that tradition is something you build, not just inherit.

“Texas A&M shaped who I am,” Goodwin said. “Now it is my turn to give back and make sure the next generation has the same chance. That is what this place does. It builds people who build the world.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2026/01/20251121_Hunter_Goodwin_MM_170.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:41.546836

And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.","Ford Motor Co.’s staggering $19.5 billion write-down of its massive electric vehicle investment is a stark illustration of how difficult it’s become for state governments to pick winning companies and technologies.

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies. And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.

But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.

In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.

But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.

Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.

The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.

Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.

Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.

Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.

Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.

GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.

On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.

Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the

Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.

President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”

But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”

Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.

Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant. Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.

There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.

Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.

The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.

“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0384-2-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:13.505140

First reported by Automotive News, the license is valid through Oct. 31, clearing the way for Scout to sell its electric vehicles in the state.

Cody Thacker, vice president of commercial operations at Scout Motors, emphasized the benefits for consumers and the company’s commitment to the state.

“Scout Motors would like to thank the Colorado Auto Industry Division and the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board for conducting their due diligence on our dealer license application and affirming our legal right to sell vehicles under Colorado law,” Thacker said in an email statement to The Post.

“This direct sales model allows us to lower costs for consumers, provide greater price transparency, deliver a faster and more convenient transaction process, and establish one-to-one relationships with customers.”

Founded in September 2022, Thacker said Scout Motors is an independent American company, building everything from the ground up.

While an independent company, Scout Motors is backed by Volkswagen AG, a publicly traded German company, making it a member of the Volkswagen Group.

The Scout, originally produced by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980, stakes its claim as the world’s first utility vehicle.

The Volkswagen Group acquired the trademark for the Scout brand in 2021 through its purchase of Navistar, which was created in 1986 when International Harvester reorganized its truck division.

The license approval also marks a milestone for Scout’s vehicle model launch plans. Beginning in 2027, Scout plans to start production of its Traveler SUV and Terra truck.

Scout vehicles will be engineered in Detroit and built in South Carolina, drawing on the manufacturing and production expertise of the Volkswagen Group.

Both models will be offered with either a fully electric power source delivering an estimated range of up to 350 miles, or an available gas-powered range extender that recharges the battery and enables more than 500 miles of total range.

Entry-level pricing for both models is expected to start under $60,000.

Kyle Boyd, communications manager for the Colorado Department of Revenue, confirmed with The Post that the license allows Scout to sell new, used and wholesale motor vehicles.

The Motor Vehicle Dealer Board consists of nine members, including three motor vehicle dealers, three used vehicle dealers and three public members. The Division Director and Executive Secretary of the Board, John Opeka, was not available for comment.

Colorado dealers quickly criticized the move, saying it was an attempt to sidestep laws that keep automakers out of retail sales. Volkswagen dealers have also filed lawsuits in the past to block Scout’s direct-sales plans in other states.

“Ultimately, we are disappointed in the outcome of the licensing action,” said Colorado Automobile Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves.

“But it is only the first step in this journey. Our industry will look to preserve justice and protect our franchise law through every available means.”

In March 2020, Gov. Jared Polis signed a law amending the state’s dealer statute to allow vehicle manufacturers to own, operate and control dealerships in Colorado only if they make exclusively electric vehicles and do not have any franchised dealers of the same line-make.

The board determined that Scout Motors is not the same “line-make” as Volkswagen, Audi, or Porsche, a legal distinction that allowed the approval despite Volkswagen’s financial backing, according to GM Authority.

Despite the opposition, Thacker said Scout Motors is committed to its customers and “will not be intimidated out of doing what is right for them.”

“Despite repeated attempts by dealer lobbyists to unfairly prevent Colorado consumers from choosing how they want to buy cars, this decisive approval by the Dealer Board ensures that we can continue moving forward with our business plans to invest in Colorado, employ Colorado workers and deliver a modern, customer-focused experience for thousands of future Scout owners in the state,” he said.

Scout plans to open retail stores in 16 metro areas, with a long-term goal of expanding to roughly 100 locations across the U.S. and Canada by 2032, according to its website.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Scout-EV_Group_0748_wide.jpg?w=1024&h=576,N,,2026-01-12 11:04:17.859569

The Nuclear Energy Institute represents the commercial nuclear technologies industry. Its mission is to ensure nuclear energy continues to grow as a reliable, affordable, carbon-­free backbone of the U.S. electric grid. To that end, we at NEI track all state legislation, executive orders, regulatory proceedings, and other state conversations on behalf of our members—translating policy and discussions into clear, actional guidance for governors, legislators, and utility regulators. NEI serves as a trusted partner to state leaders, offering policy models, technical expertise, and regulatory pathways that help states move from interest to implementation. We work side by side with our members to help state leaders make informed decisions about nuclear’s role in a state’s energy mix. Here are some of the highlights from the past year.

States leading the way in 2025

These states took big strides in 2025 to signal support and clear pathways for nuclear development.

Indiana has proactively shown support for nuclear during the past several years, with Gov. Mike Braun and the state legislature adopting a variety of policies to attract new nuclear business to the state. The legislature passed multiple bills this session, creating a small modular reactor partnership pilot program, authorizing cost recovery for preconstruction expenses on new nuclear projects, and providing a 20 percent tax credit to support SMR manufacturing.

North Carolina enacted a bill that expands the state’s Construction Work in Progress (CWIP), allowing a utility to collect financing costs for a project before construction is completed. This mechanism reduces the cost to finance a project and may lower the total project costs that eventually are included in the customer rate base.

Tennessee’s state leaders, led by Gov. Bill Lee, have strongly backed nuclear energy as a centerpiece of their long-­term energy and economic strategy. The 2025 budget earmarked $50 million to the Tennessee Valley Authority to assist in accelerating construction of SMRs and $10 million toward workforce development. Lee also formally designated the East Tennessee Economic Council’s long-­standing nuclear working group as the Tennessee Nuclear Network (TN²), a statewide official partnership for advancing nuclear innovation, workforce development, and economic opportunities.

Texas also had a big year, where the state legislature—which uniquely only meets every other year—authorized $350 million to support nuclear projects and established the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office to serve as a single point of contact for nuclear project developers navigating state and local permitting processes. Additional legislation supports permitting processes for uranium mining operations and creates an advanced nuclear energy workforce program.

Utah’s legislative and executive branches continue to work in tandem. In 2025, the legislature established a nuclear energy consortium and state energy council to advise on development and used fuel, while Gov. Spencer Cox signed several new partnerships, including a regional energy compact with Idaho and Wyoming.

Virginia’s public service commission approved up to $122 million in cost recovery for Appalachian Power to pursue site evaluation and SMR development. Additionally, the Virginia Nuclear Energy Consortium released its five-­year strategic plan for 2025–2029, which aims to accelerate the deployment of SMRs, strengthen the nuclear workforce, expand the nuclear supply chain, and develop a research and education reactor facility through the Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub.

Executive momentum

In these states, governors have signed executive orders, issued public statements, or announced projects that support feasibility studies or the deployment of new reactors.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed an executive order creating the Arizona Energy Promise Task Force, which is charged with studying, coordinating, and advancing key energy-­related policies, including a focus on advanced nuclear generation.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order establishing the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force. Since then, the state has published an Advanced Nuclear Strategic Framework and, most recently, has issued a request for information seeking industry input on site selection factors to identify ways the state can attract nuclear energy investment.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey announced a partnership with the University of Massachusetts–Lowell to launch the Massachusetts Roadmap for Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy, which outlines a statewide strategy to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion technologies by touching on policy, infrastructure, workforce development, and public engagement.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) this past summer to develop and construct at least 1 GW of advanced nuclear capacity to support the state’s grid. The state is also realizing the critical importance of its existing fleet. As part of an open docket before the public service commission, the Department of Public Service staff released a report calling for a 20-­year extension of New York’s zero-­emission credit program.

Utah Gov. Cox’s Operation Gigawatt, launched in 2024 with the goal of doubling the state’s power production over the next 10 years, continues to lead the state forward on nuclear. In late November, Utah announced a landmark partnership to build a combined nuclear manufacturing, training, and reactor deployment hub in Brigham City.

Moratorium movement

Some states historically have had specific restrictions on the books about the construction of new nuclear power facilities. Momentum to remove these outdated prohibitions has grown in recent years, with Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Wisconsin repealing their moratoriums. That momentum continued in 2025 with several more states removing these bans to make way for additional opportunities for nuclear.

Connecticut repealed its moratorium on nuclear, allowing municipalities to opt in to hosting advanced nuclear through a local vote.

Illinois repealed its 300-­MW reactor size limit on new reactors.

Rhode Island is allowing utilities to procure nuclear power and enter into long-­term nuclear contracts. These actions serve as an exception to the state’s moratorium against nuclear.

Grid aligned

These states are developing the regulatory, financial, and institutional infrastructure needed to support new nuclear deployment.

Arizona’s corporation commission is actively holding workshops to educate stakeholders and the public on advanced nuclear. Additionally, Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project, and Tucson Electric Power announced a partnership to explore new nuclear capacity in the state, including evaluating potential sites for new nuclear facilities, including SMRs and large reactors.

Kentucky has directed its public service commission to develop a siting process for new nuclear facilities, hold public hearings, and survey other states on regulatory qualifications and compensation. The state is planning a multiday conference in the coming year to discuss nuclear deployment with interested stakeholders.

New Jersey’s board of public utilities issued a request for information on deploying new nuclear, and the legislature introduced a bill that establishes a state-­backed incentive program to develop 1.2 GW of nuclear capacity.

Laying the groundwork

These states are evaluating where and how advanced reactors could be sited and deployed.

Studying: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin each have initiated feasibility studies, while Florida’s public service commission completed its own technical and economic assessment last year. Nebraska is moving into the second phase of its statewide study, narrowing 16 potential communities down to three or four possible sites for new nuclear deployment.

Collaborating: Delaware and Hawaii established feasibility-­focused task forces and working groups, while Maryland’s public service commission convened a working group to examine the implementation of its nuclear procurement program.

Defining as clean: Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and New Hampshire join other states in expanding the definition of clean energy to specifically include nuclear.

Multistate collaboration

National associations of state policymakers are showing more interest than ever before in nuclear energy. These organizations represent various state stakeholders that are dedicating funding and resources to enable state officials to explore policies to support nuclear and share best practices between states.

The Council of State Governments Midwestern Legislative Conference, which represents all three branches of government in 11 Midwest states and four Canadian provinces, passed a resolution in support of new nuclear development.

The National Association of State Energy Officials formed an 11-­state collaborative to support first movers in new nuclear and accelerate advanced reactor projects by working with the private sector, the U.S. Department of Energy, and Congress. NASEO also issued a request for information to identify opportunities for states to collaborate and support the formation of an order book for new nuclear, which would help drive down costs associated with first-­of-­a-­kind projects.

The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners passed its first resolution in direct support of nuclear, enabling it and state regulators to weigh in with supportive language on a variety of nuclear-­related topics.

The National Governors Association launched an initiative to explore ways to support nuclear development in states interested in nuclear energy policy. NGA has provided two-­day, in-­state nuclear convenings in six states and a regional New England partnership to explore nuclear’s role in each state’s energy planning.

The Western Governors’ Association unveiled its 2025–2026 Chair Initiative, led by Utah Gov. Cox—a yearlong endeavor exploring nuclear and other energy opportunities in the West.

More state activity

In addition to Iowa’s potential restart of Duane Arnold Energy Center, Pennsylvania is on track to reopen Crane Clean Energy Center (formally Three Mile Island-­1) by 2027—a development supported by a 20-­year power purchase agreement with Microsoft. Moreover, Palisades in Michigan has officially changed from decommissioning to operating status. State support and various state and local approvals are required to bring these plants back on line.

As states confront rising electricity demand driven by data centers, domestic manufacturing, and broad electrification efforts, nuclear energy has become a practical necessity. The bipartisan surge of support for nuclear power shows that states understand what’s at stake: reliable, affordable, carbon-­free energy that offers economic growth for states and communities for decades. It’s clear that 2026 is shaping up to be another pivotal year for nuclear energy. State policymakers and regulators are laying the groundwork needed to turn broad conversations into actionable projects. States that commit to that path now will shape America’s energy landscape for generations.

Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.
Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers.
GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution.
And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.","Ford Motor Co.’s staggering $19.5 billion write-down of its massive electric vehicle investment is a stark illustration of how difficult it’s become for state governments to pick winning companies and technologies.

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies. And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.

But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.

In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.

But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.

Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.

The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.

Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.

Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.

Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.

Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.

GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.

On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.

Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the

Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.

President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”

But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”

Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.

Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant. Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.

There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.

Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.

The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.

“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dsc_0384-2-1024x6831768226633.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=hlDtqQP-,N,,2026-01-12 09:58:41.563718

This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk, and my office is taking action to stop it,” said the Attorney General.
These unlawful actions cannot stand.” Attorney General James argues that the stop-work orders will have immediate and severe consequences, including significant economic harm throughout New York.
Attorney General James also asserts that the administration’s actions will harm New Yorkers’ health and wallets.
She is asking the court to declare the stop-work orders unlawful and block their enforcement.","In December 2025, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) abruptly issued stop-work orders to the New York-based Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind projects, directing them to immediately suspend all construction due to undisclosed “national security” concerns.

Attorney General James argues that these orders are arbitrary and unwarranted, as both projects underwent years of extensive national security and safety reviews, and pausing these projects could threaten New York’s economy and energy grid. She is asking the court to intervene to block the administration’s stop-work orders.

“These projects were carefully reviewed and already under construction when the federal government pulled the plug without explanation. This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk, and my office is taking action to stop it,” said the Attorney General.

“New York will not back down in our fight for clean energy and I commend Attorney General James for taking this action to lift the unlawful stop-work orders on New York’s two offshore wind projects under construction,” said Governor Kathy Hochul.

“The Trump administration’s incomprehensible obsession with shutting down these fully permitted projects lacks legal justification, hurts his stated goal of US energy independence, and will cost New York thousands of jobs and needed power to keep the lights on and attract economic development opportunities. These unlawful actions cannot stand.”

Attorney General James argues that the stop-work orders will have immediate and severe consequences, including significant economic harm throughout New York. Together, the projects support thousands of union jobs, billions of dollars in private and public investment, and major infrastructure improvements in communities across Long Island and New York City. Halting construction risks delaying or permanently derailing the projects, jeopardising contracts, local tax revenue, workforce training programmes, and long-term economic development tied to New York’s clean energy transition.

Attorney General James also asserts that the administration’s actions will harm New Yorkers’ health and wallets.

If I had to guess, nearly all 197 lawmakers heading to Jefferson City for legislative session would agree with this statement: We need to protect and bolster Missouri’s family farms and the farm economy. There are many different policies to consider and ways to tackle this. But what would be one of the most impactful today, from the family farmer’s perspective? The Missouri legislature needs to close the legal loophole concerning critical pesticide technologies.

If you’re not familiar with the issue, it’s politically known around the Capitol as the “failure-to-warn” bill, centered around a widely used pesticide called glyphosate, or Roundup, manufactured by the St. Louis business, Bayer Crop Science.

To sell this product, the product manufacturer must register the product through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If the product is deemed to be safe for use through the registration process, the agency issues a federal label to be placed on the product that gives direct instruction on its use. Manufacturers are not legally allowed to deviate from the EPA approved label. But what is occurring is companies are following federal law appropriately and are being sued for doing so.

The World Health Organization (WHO)—through their cancer research arm known as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)—deemed this product to be “probably carcinogenic to humans.” It should be noted IARC classified it as a “Group 2A,” which is a list of what they deem to be “probable carcinogens” and includes the consumption of red meat, hot beverages like coffee, and being a hairdresser.

Regardless, this finding is contrary to the EPA’s finding, along with nearly all other regulatory bodies around the globe. On their official website the EPA states, “EPA considered a significantly more extensive and relevant dataset than the International Agency on the Research for Cancer (IARC).” In February of 2020, they again found there are no risks of concern to human health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label.

So, what’s the issue? Plaintiffs claimed they were harmed by their use of this product and are using IARCs finding as the basis of their claim. Some courts and juries, be it a minority as more cases have been won by product manufacturers than lost, are awarding major payouts since the product manufacturer “failed to warn” that the product might cause cancer.

So why don’t the companies just place a label on the product saying, “This product might cause cancer?” Because the EPA will not approve a label with unscientific claims like that, thus causing a de facto ban on farmers having access to the technology. This was evidenced when EPA issued a letter in 2019 stating they would not approve a label for a glyphosate with a warning on it. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California issued a preliminary injunction enjoining California from enforcing the state warning requirements involving glyphosate’s carcinogenicity, based on the fact the required warning statement is false and misleading.

The time is now to enact common sense measures that protect Missouri farm families having access to these critical technologies. Farmers have relied on glyphosate for weed control since 1974, and for the past few decades’ glyphosate has played an integral role in regenerative agriculture and conservation practices. The use of effective herbicides like glyphosate allows producers to adequately control yield-compromising weed pressure, vastly decrease carbon emissions, all while preventing erosion and enhancing overall soil health. Unfortunately, this product may no longer be available to Missouri family farmers due to frivolous lawsuits. Simply put, without access to these crop protection tools, food prices skyrocket, consumers suffer, global competitors gain market share, and Missouri family farms go out of business.

The Missouri Soybean Association (MSA) agrees with President Trump and the Solicitor General that federal law preempts these egregious lawsuits. Missouri lawmakers need to close this legal loophole and stop the increased costs on farmer inputs for an extensively tested and viable product. My question to the Missouri legislature is this; is a Pro-Trump, Pro-Ag State like Missouri really going to side with the World Health Organization over the Trump administration, family farmers, and actual science?",https://themissouritimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpEdWeb2.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 09:58:37.927541

Fusion energy can provide the large amounts of reliable, emissions-free power that advanced AI systems require.","The global shift toward electrification is placing unprecedented strain on power systems, with electricity demand rising faster than they can accommodate.

Advances in fusion technology, combined with growing public and private investment, suggest fusion could evolve into a scalable, zero-carbon baseload energy source.

To meet the energy needs of tomorrow, technology must be scaled up, grids upgraded and access to innovation developed.

We are entering the “Age of Electricity,” according to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2025. As advanced and emerging economies make that shift, the world will experience an unprecedented 40% surge in electricity demand in less than a decade.

The biggest drivers are unsurprising: the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) along with the related buildout of data centres carry an enormous appetite for power. In the United States alone, data centres may require more than 100 gigawatts of new capacity, with similar pressures mounting in Europe, India, China and the Middle East.

But the challenge is bigger than that.

Industrial reshoring, widespread electrification and rising heating and cooling loads driven by extreme weather are placing new upward pressure on energy demand, weakening the long-standing relationship between economic growth and declining energy intensity.

Global investment in power generation has raced to about $1 trillion per year since 2015, while grid spending lags at roughly $400 billion, producing congestion, curtailment and interconnection delays.

In the United States, critical data centre projects are being held back by 2 to 6 years, compounded by shortages of transformers and switchgear. Efficiency helps but AI‑optimized servers draw two to four times the power of traditional servers.

How fusion could fulfil clean energy needs

We are entering a new industrial age where today’s breakthroughs require more clean, reliable power than any period in modern history.

The development of energy technology will determine how far and fast a power transformation can go. Scalable, clean baseload power underpins all infrastructure, from data centres to supply chains and without an abundant and resilient energy source, progress will stall.

Fusion energy could change that.

Fusion is the energy source that powers the stars. It has the potential to provide the energy needs of modern cities and industries without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. This positions fusion as a potential backbone of global digital infrastructure.

According to the Max Planck Institute, fusion energy power plants will supply power similar to that of present-day large-scale power stations powered by coal but with vastly different amounts of fuel needed.

One gram of fusion fuel could provide 90,000 kilowatt-hours of energy in a power plant, comparable to the combustion heat generated by 11 tons of coal.

Fusion power plants are also designed to be inherently safe, without the risks of runaway reactions, meltdowns or high-level, long-lived radioactive waste. It also avoids the regulatory red tape of traditional nuclear fission. Fusion energy can be sited and scaled to provide primary energy wherever and whenever it is needed.

It also avoids the regulatory red tape of traditional nuclear fission. Fusion energy can be sited and scaled to provide primary energy wherever and whenever it is needed.

For science and manufacturing, abundant energy to accelerate computation power shortens development cycles and expands what’s possible.

Why fusion would rebalance energy security

For the first time, shifting to fusion could allow us to build technology that produces energy rather than relying on finite resource consumption.

This unlocks a new class of economic opportunity, from high-value manufacturing and advanced materials to resilient domestic power for AI, data centres, and energy-intensive industries, while establishing a fundamentally new paradigm for energy security.

If fusion energy is deployed at scale and countries achieve energy independence, energy supply would also evade geopolitical tensions that has allowed states to weaponize energy resources. Global markets would, therefore, become far less vulnerable to the energy-driven price shocks and inflationary pressures that have historically followed armed conflicts.

Global markets would, therefore, become far less vulnerable to the energy-driven price shocks and inflationary pressures that have historically followed armed conflicts.

Advancements in fusion energy development

Technology innovations in fusion, recently driven largely by the private sector, will make it possible for this new energy source to become a baseload resource capable of stablizing grids, enable electrified industries and support mission-critical power.

A site in Virginia for the world’s first grid-scale commercial fusion power plant is now zoned specifically for a fusion power plant, with permitting and construction as the next steps toward putting electricity onto the grid by the early 2030s.

Leaders around the world are also working to accelerate deployment, with the United States establishing an Office of Fusion to make it a clear priority. China is also investing billions in their capabilities, Germany developing a funding programme for startups and several countries around the world, from the United Kingdom to Japan, adopting regulatory frameworks to provide certainty to developers.

Fusion energy can provide the large amounts of reliable, emissions-free power that advanced AI systems require. In turn, AI can accelerate the design, operation and commercialization of fusion itself. This creates a first-of-its-kind symbiotic relationship: a self-reinforcing cycle in which fusion enables AI and AI accelerates fusion’s path to scale.

Together, this emerging AI-fusion nexus has the potential to reshape industrial systems, strengthen energy security and open new manufacturing and scientific frontiers, rather than merely meeting today’s energy demands.

What can help accelerate fusion deployment?

Sustained economic growth will increasingly depend on investments in advanced energy systems, including the development and deployment of commercial fusion and on integrating these systems with AI, industrial and manufacturing ecosystems.

Regulatory and policy frameworks that support scaling and attract private-sector capital will be important enablers of this process.

Many countries are beginning to develop strategies that align technological innovation with energy and security priorities, bringing these considerations into a more coordinated policy framework.

Decisions made in the coming years, such as where to site data centres, how to modernize power grids and expand transmission and how to secure supply chains for advanced materials, will influence the reliability, affordability and resilience of future energy systems, as well as their capacity to support economic activity and national security objectives.

The overarching objectives are greater resilience, productivity and strategic autonomy. Building domestic capabilities across the fusion value chain can contribute to these goals and shape longer-term leadership in energy and related technologies.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_rE9QIQCe4s-cpLj_ZwX6MY3rF_qUfj3nitNajltBNP8.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:03.875169

Trump’s memo did not specify whether or not his administration will submit a formal notice of termination to the UN.
But in Koh’s view, congressional silence should not be interpreted as consent to exit the treaty.
Rhode Island senator and climate hawk Sheldon Whitehouse also said Trump’s withdrawal is “not just corrupt, it’s illegal”.
“Climate action won’t stop because of the latest US treaty withdrawal, either in the US or globally.","The Trump administration’s long-anticipated decision this week to pull the US from the world’s most important climate treaty may have been illegal, some experts say.

“In my legal opinion, he does not have the authority,” Harold Hongju Koh, former head lawyer for the US state department, told the Guardian.

In a Wednesday presidential memorandum, the president said the US “shall withdraw” from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions that it deemed “contrary to the interests of the United States”. It marks the first time any country has ever moved to exit the agreement.

The UN climate body requires one year’s notice for withdrawal, so the United States will not cease being a party for a year. Trump’s memo did not specify whether or not his administration will submit a formal notice of termination to the UN.

Reached for comment, a state department spokesperson noted that Trump’s memo said the agency will take all necessary “steps to effectuate the withdrawal of the United States from the organizations as soon as possible”. The person also referred the Guardian to secretary of state Marco Rubio’s Wednesday statement, where he said the Trump administration is exiting institutions and treaties which it believes to be “redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity”.

Because the country entered the UNFCCC with the consultation and approval of the Senate in 1992, “there is an open question” about whether or not the president can unilaterally exit the agreement, Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University, wrote in an email.

The UNFCCC and the Paris climate agreement – the landmark 2015 climate pact underpinned by the UNFCCC, from which Trump pulled the US last January – both say that parties may withdraw with one year’s written notice. But unlike the UNFCCC, the Paris agreement was never ratified by the US Senate, Gerrard noted.

“President Obama took the position that since the Paris agreement did not impose binding legal obligations on the US, it was not a treaty that required Senate ratification,” he said. “In contrast, President George HW Bush submitted the UNFCCC to the Senate, which unanimously ratified it in 1992, and he then signed it.”

Some scholars argue that the president has the ability to unilaterally end treaties – if not legally, then practically, because Congress has previously acquiesced to the executive branch.

“In practice, presidents have long asserted the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties and other international agreements without seeking the approval of either the Senate or Congress,” said Curtis Bradley, a University of Chicago law school professor and former counselor of international law at the state department.

But in Koh’s view, congressional silence should not be interpreted as consent to exit the treaty. A “mirror principle” should dictate that the same amount of congressional input needed to enter into a treaty should be required to withdraw from it, said Koh, now an international legal expert at Yale University.

“If I had an agreement that I made by myself, it would make sense that I could leave by myself,” he said. “But if my wife and I made an agreement that both of us had to sign, could I withdraw from it by myself? I believe we would both have to withdraw.” He said he expects groups to sue the administration over its memo.

Rhode Island senator and climate hawk Sheldon Whitehouse also said Trump’s withdrawal is “not just corrupt, it’s illegal”.

“This polluter-driven stoogery shows the full extent of creepy polluters’ control over the Trump administration. Trump’s corrupt fossil-fuel interests threaten the wellbeing of millions around the world on the frontlines of climate disaster, defy the will of the American people, and damage US economic competitiveness,” he said in a statement, adding that he believes “once the Senate has ratified a treaty, only the Senate can withdraw from the treaty”.

The US constitution does not explicitly spell out such a mirror principle, only stating that the president “shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur”.

The supreme court has also never ruled on the topic: though it took up the issue of treaty exit in 1979 when then president Jimmy Carter withdrew from a treaty establishing diplomatic relations with China, the justices “splintered and didn’t come to a single rationale” on which US governmental branch can exit treaties, and under what circumstances, said Koh.

Jean Galbraith, an international law expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey law school, said the issue of unilateral withdrawal is “hard” and “complex”. Even when the Senate recommends entry into treaties, she said, the president has the discretion not to take their advice.

“When you think about withdrawal, you can think about, what exactly is the president doing? Are they just ratcheting back that last step of ratification,” she asked. “Maybe the president would say, ‘I’m just pulling back the instrument of ratification.’ Maybe the president would say, ‘I have the power to do this withdrawal unilaterally, at least as far as I don’t have anything from the Senate or Congress telling me explicitly that I don’t have that power.’”

Experts also disagree on what it would take for the US to re-enter the UNFCCC. Some experts believe that Trump’s exit nullifies the 1992 Senate vote in support of joining.

“My own view is that a president would need to obtain a new approval,” said Bradley. “The US constitution requires senatorial approval for joining treaties but does not clearly require senatorial approval for leaving treaties.”

That would mean the process of reentry would require a future president to secure the support of two-thirds of the Senate to agree to re-enter the treaty, which would be difficult to obtain in the contemporary political climate.

Galbraith, however, believes the two-thirds Senate vote from 1992 remains in effect.

Others, including Galbraith, believe that if Trump can unilaterally exit a treaty, a future president could rejoin it without a new two-thirds Senate vote.

“You still have that on the books,” she said.

Sue Biniaz, former principal deputy special envoy for climate at the state department, shares that perspective.

“Climate action won’t stop because of the latest US treaty withdrawal, either in the US or globally. And the federal retreat is, hopefully, a temporary one. There are multiple future pathways to rejoining the key climate agreements,” she said, adding that she specifically agrees that the US could “rather seamlessly rejoin the UNFCCC based on the Senate’s approval in 1992”.

Trump’s exit from the UNFCCC indicates to the rest of the world that the US is “an unreliable partner for long term commitments”, said Galbraith.

“It’s a further signal of real antipathy to fixing what is a real and increasingly dire problem,” she said.

The withdrawal from the agreement came on the one-year anniversary of devastating fires in Los Angeles, and days after the shocking capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, after which the president outlined a vision of the US boosting fossil fuel extraction from the South American country.

“Trump’s contempt for international efforts to build peace and solidarity continues to shred the nation’s international credibility and will cause irreparable damage to current and future generations both at home and abroad,” said Melinda St Louis, director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch. “As climate harms escalate, choosing withdrawal is a shortsighted, profoundly irresponsible retreat from international leadership when it is needed more than ever.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635db193737a1a92708152706b2976acbe30373d/358_0_3583_2867/master/3583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2148431d6c260fa6a62ad9439e10181",N,,2026-01-12 09:13:10.589670

DETROIT, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As President Donald Trump prepares to travel to Detroit this week to address the Detroit Economic Club and tour a Ford Motor Co. plant during the opening of the North American International Auto Show, new national research from EVs for All America finds that Americans' views on electric vehicles are evolving, with Republican resistance easing but concerns about jobs, China and affordability still shaping the market.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" said EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The report, Fixing America's Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress, analyzes three years of national polling of U.S. auto consumers and finds positive movement among Republicans, strong partisan polarization over Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and a clear road map to sell more EVs across America.

Key findings from the new report include:

Republican hostility toward EVs has lessened by 20 points over three years.

GOP voters are increasingly less likely to say EVs are ""for people who see the world differently,"" signaling a gradual thaw in cultural resistance.

President Trump faces significant doubts among consumers about his support for the U.S. auto industry. Only 28 percent of auto consumer voters in households earning $50,000 or more rate President Trump as a ""Friend of the U.S. Auto Industry."" The sample represents more than 80 percent of the new- and used-vehicle market and roughly two-thirds of the presidential-year electorate.

Opinions of Elon Musk are sharply divided along party lines.

While Republicans give Musk favorable ratings (which has helped thaw GOP consumers' hostility to EVs), Democrats overwhelmingly hold strongly unfavorable views at 86 percent, creating a significant branding problem for Tesla.

Republican voters are deeply concerned about the loss of auto manufacturing jobs to China.

The majority of Republican voters worry that U.S. national security is at risk if America's industrial base continues to erode with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China. 88 percent worry at least some, including 53 percent who worry a lot.

The loss of federal EV subsidies cools consumer interest.

Roughly half of auto consumers say the end of federal EV incentives makes them less likely to buy or lease an electric vehicle. Conversely, an examination of EV sales in Germany after EV subsidies ended shows a strong recovery over the two years since the credits ended, following an initial sales decline.

Multifamily building residents remain a significant opportunity for increased EV sales if overnight ""Level 2"" charging is added to apartment buildings and condo parking.

65 percent of condo owners and 70 percent of apartment renters say they would be more likely to buy or lease an EV if their building offered overnight Level 2 charging in parking spaces. The finding highlights a major adoption barrier for urban and suburban consumers who lack access to private garages.

Consumers clearly report that the best path to selling more EVs, both in red states and blue, involves moving marketing messages away from ""green"" messaging and instead focusing on the many positive vehicle attributes that EV drivers enjoy, including fast, fun to drive, quiet, and the ability to avoid traditional and expensive gas stations.

The data show that consumers under 45 are far more open to EVs than older consumers, a trend that should grow as younger consumers age and gain market share. In a troubling long-term sign for existing auto brands in the U.S., younger consumers under 45 show a definite open-mindedness to purchasing Chinese-made vehicles, while consumers over 55 are far more hostile.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" said Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs. Since 80 percent of all EVs sold in America are sold in 15 states, smart pro-EV policy in those core states is the best public policy move in the short term. Opinions of EVs are always higher in states with a large EV market penetration since our data shows positive word of mouth is a huge factor in attracting more EV customers.""

Murphy said the findings offer timely context as national political leaders spotlight manufacturing and the auto industry.

""With the President heading to Detroit to talk about jobs and American manufacturing, this research underscores that EVs are an important path to creating more American auto jobs and helping secure U.S. auto manufacturing, not targets of a culture war,"" Murphy said. ""That only helps China seize the future of the global auto industry, a real threat to the U.S. and our allies. Automotive and political leaders should take our findings on younger consumers' interest in Chinese-made cars seriously as well.""

The report is based on annual national surveys of 600 registered voters age 18 and older in households earning $50,000 or more, representing more than 80 percent of the U.S. new- and used-vehicle market. EVs for All America conducted these surveys each November from 2023 through 2025. The report also incorporates additional research, including an October 2024 survey of 800 registered Republicans and an October 2025 survey of 400 California condo and apartment residents. National polling was conducted by Hill Research Consultants, with the California survey conducted by David Binder and Associates.

DETROIT, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As President Donald Trump prepares to travel to Detroit this week to address the Detroit Economic Club and tour a Ford Motor Co. plant during the opening of the North American International Auto Show, new national research from EVs for All America finds that Americans' views on electric vehicles are evolving, with Republican resistance easing but concerns about jobs, China and affordability still shaping the market.

""Our latest national survey of auto consumers has good and bad news for EVs,"" said EVs for All America founder and CEO Mike Murphy. ""The fierce partisan polarization over EVs is declining, but the removal of federal EV subsidies remains a cooling factor for sales in the short term.""

The report, Fixing America's Partisan Divide Over EVs: Tracking Three Years of Slow Progress, analyzes three years of national polling of U.S. auto consumers and finds positive movement among Republicans, strong partisan polarization over Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and a clear road map to sell more EVs across America.

Key findings from the new report include:

Republican hostility toward EVs has lessened by 20 points over three years.

GOP voters are increasingly less likely to say EVs are ""for people who see the world differently,"" signaling a gradual thaw in cultural resistance.

President Trump faces significant doubts among consumers about his support for the U.S. auto industry. Only 28 percent of auto consumer voters in households earning $50,000 or more rate President Trump as a ""Friend of the U.S. Auto Industry."" The sample represents more than 80 percent of the new- and used-vehicle market and roughly two-thirds of the presidential-year electorate.

Opinions of Elon Musk are sharply divided along party lines.

While Republicans give Musk favorable ratings (which has helped thaw GOP consumers' hostility to EVs), Democrats overwhelmingly hold strongly unfavorable views at 86 percent, creating a significant branding problem for Tesla.

Republican voters are deeply concerned about the loss of auto manufacturing jobs to China.

The majority of Republican voters worry that U.S. national security is at risk if America's industrial base continues to erode with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China. 88 percent worry at least some, including 53 percent who worry a lot.

The loss of federal EV subsidies cools consumer interest.

Roughly half of auto consumers say the end of federal EV incentives makes them less likely to buy or lease an electric vehicle. Conversely, an examination of EV sales in Germany after EV subsidies ended shows a strong recovery over the two years since the credits ended, following an initial sales decline.

Multifamily building residents remain a significant opportunity for increased EV sales if overnight ""Level 2"" charging is added to apartment buildings and condo parking.

65 percent of condo owners and 70 percent of apartment renters say they would be more likely to buy or lease an EV if their building offered overnight Level 2 charging in parking spaces. The finding highlights a major adoption barrier for urban and suburban consumers who lack access to private garages.

Consumers clearly report that the best path to selling more EVs, both in red states and blue, involves moving marketing messages away from ""green"" messaging and instead focusing on the many positive vehicle attributes that EV drivers enjoy, including fast, fun to drive, quiet, and the ability to avoid traditional and expensive gas stations.

The data show that consumers under 45 are far more open to EVs than older consumers, a trend that should grow as younger consumers age and gain market share. In a troubling long-term sign for existing auto brands in the U.S., younger consumers under 45 show a definite open-mindedness to purchasing Chinese-made vehicles, while consumers over 55 are far more hostile.

""The path to breaking down the partisan EV divide is clear in the data,"" said Murphy. ""It's all about focusing on great vehicle performance and attributes, not on political climate dogma. It's also about smart EV policy at the state level, including state incentives such as California's proposed new program, since the Trump administration has decided to back away from federal support for EVs. Since 80 percent of all EVs sold in America are sold in 15 states, smart pro-EV policy in those core states is the best public policy move in the short term. Opinions of EVs are always higher in states with a large EV market penetration since our data shows positive word of mouth is a huge factor in attracting more EV customers.""

Murphy said the findings offer timely context as national political leaders spotlight manufacturing and the auto industry.

""With the President heading to Detroit to talk about jobs and American manufacturing, this research underscores that EVs are an important path to creating more American auto jobs and helping secure U.S. auto manufacturing, not targets of a culture war,"" Murphy said. ""That only helps China seize the future of the global auto industry, a real threat to the U.S. and our allies. Automotive and political leaders should take our findings on younger consumers' interest in Chinese-made cars seriously as well.""

The report is based on annual national surveys of 600 registered voters age 18 and older in households earning $50,000 or more, representing more than 80 percent of the U.S. new- and used-vehicle market. EVs for All America conducted these surveys each November from 2023 through 2025. The report also incorporates additional research, including an October 2024 survey of 800 registered Republicans and an October 2025 survey of 400 California condo and apartment residents. National polling was conducted by Hill Research Consultants, with the California survey conducted by David Binder and Associates.

Scott Perry (R-10th District).
The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.

Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams.","A bill aimed at averting another government shutdown this month would divert $500 million for states and tribal governments to repair landscapes damaged by coal mining.

Pennsylvania, with a centuries-long legacy of resource extraction, stands to be the hardest hit by a loss of grant money if the transfer of funds remains in the final version.

House Resolution 6938 passed by a 397-28 vote in the U.S. House and is now in the U.S. Senate for consideration. The money is from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and would be redirected to wildfire management and National Forest Service operations.

It’s one of three bills in a “minibus” appropriations package for the upcoming fiscal year that congressional Democrats lauded for rejecting the Trump administration “draconian” cuts to a variety of federal programs, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service.

Each of Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. representatives voted in favor of the bill except for Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). His office did not respond to a request for comment.

While the commonwealth is one of more than two dozen states and tribes that received grants last year, Eric Dixon, a researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, said coal mining regions in Pennsylvania are most likely to feel the impact.

In 2025, the state received about $245 million or nearly 34% of the $725 million the U.S. Department of the Interior distributed. If Pennsylvania receives the same proportion of funds in the 2026 fiscal year budget, it would get between $130 million and $175 million less.

The money is used to address hazards from old open pit and underground mines, Dixon said, such as acid drainage polluting rivers and creeks, spoil piles that mar landscapes, and subsidence from subterranean collapses that can endanger homes and businesses.

“It’s not going to shut the program down, but it is going to be very meaningful for the homeowners who have subsidence or property that’s along a stream that’s not going to get cleaned up now,” he said.

Pennsylvania has the most acres of abandoned and unreclaimed mine lands and most abandoned wells of any state in the nation, according to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Press Secretary Neil Shader. The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.

“Cutting federal funding for these projects will hurt Pennsylvania’s ability to continue its historic work to create jobs and protect public health and safety,” Shader said, noting that IIJA funds paid to cap a majority of the 350 orphan wells under the Shapiro administration. The AML Fund is being used to address 450 abandoned mine sites across the state, he said.

Critics have characterized the transfer as a raid on the trust fund established by the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, the primary U.S. law regulating the environmental impact of coal mining. It requires mine operators to restore mined land and places a fee on mined coal to fund cleanup work at mines abandoned before the law was passed.

“The Abandoned Mine Land Fund is not a slush fund. It is a promise to communities that built this country and have lived for decades with the environmental damage left behind. Raiding it is unconscionable and an insult to hard-working families across Appalachia,” Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of the clean energy group PennFuture.

Bobby Hughes executive director of the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation said Pennsylvania was responsible for about one-third of all coal produced in the United States since it was first mined on an industrial scale in the late 1700s.

As a result, there are 28,000 abandoned mine sites across the commonwealth, 5,500 miles of polluted streams and at least 5,000 sources of acid mine drainage, Hughes said. That’s caused when water inside mines reacts with minerals in the rock, increasing its acidity and causing elements such as iron, aluminum and manganese to leach out.

“These are hazards that we’ve lived with, at least, I’ve lived with them for the last 50 some odd years, growing up here in the Wyoming Valley in the northern anthracite coal fields,” Hughes said.

Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams. The loss of those dollars would prevent such work and potentially have a negative impact on efforts to restore, reforest and redevelop them for industry, recreation and tourism.

“To take this kind of money away from … is not really doing any favor to our Appalachian communities that are already still struggling to come back out of the legacy of past minded practices,” Hughes said.

He added the investment in restoring mine land in Pennsylvania has benefits far beyond the commonwealth. The Susquehanna River, which receives mine drainage from northeastern Pennsylvania, is the Chesapeake Bay’s largest tributary. Hughes, who also sits on the board of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called it a national treasure.

“What we’re doing up here is cutting down on all kinds of sedimentation loads, coal, silts, metals, organics, phosphorus, nitrogen, that would end up going into the waterways, eventually reaching the bay, if we didn’t do the work we’re doing up here,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Catawissa-Creek-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:08.077512

The newly released ‘Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2025’, published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), highlights the increasing impact of geopolitical and geoeconomic frictions, as well as growing automation, to the renewable energy workforce.

As in previous years, it notes that uneven development continues across the world.

China remains the preeminent force in both deployment of generating capacities and equipment manufacturing, mainly owing to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices, according to Irena.

In 2024, the review points out that China created an estimated 7.3-million renewable energy jobs, or 44% of the global total.

It notes that the EU followed suit with the same total as in 2023, at 1.8-million jobs.

Additionally, it notes that Brazil’s renewables employment runs to 1.4-million, while employment in India and the US barely grew from about one-million to 1.3-million and 1.1-million, respectively.

“Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side.

“Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.

“The geographical imbalance of the job growth reminds us to get international collaboration back on track. Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community.

“This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socioeconomic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition,” says Irena director-general Francesco La Camera.

In terms of employment by technology, Irena notes that solar PV retains the lead, owing to the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing plants.

It explains that the industry employed 7.3-million people in 2024, noting that Asian countries hosted 75% of the world’s PV jobs with China garnering the bulk of the employment at 4.2-million.

Liquid biofuels follow after solar PV, creating 2.6-million jobs in 2024 with 46.5% of the total jobs generated in Asia.

Hydropower came in third place with 2.3-million jobs, and wind follows with 1.9-million jobs.

Beyond the numbers, this edition of the annual report underscores the need for more inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce, says Irena.

The agency says a just transition demands that no population groups – such as women and people with disabilities – are left at the margins, arguing that the renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives.

To this day, both groups’ potential remains underutilised, which calls for deliberate, multifaceted and systemic action, says Irena.

“A just transition to a renewables-based future must be grounded in inclusion, dignity, and equal opportunity.

“As countries scale up renewable energy investments and job creation, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that accessibility for persons with disabilities – who too often face barriers to inclusion in labour markets despite their skills, experience and talent - is built into every stage of policy design and implementation.

“This requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker’s rights.

“Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice; it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development. By removing barriers to equality and promoting decent work, we strengthen economies and ensure that the energy transition truly works for all,” says ILO director-general Gilbert Houngbo.

The review argues that fostering a culture that respects diversity and upholds inclusion and fairness requires sustained, inclusive policy frameworks including accessible education and training, labour market services, and other measures.

It says that designing and shaping such policies requires that all stakeholders have a seat at the table, especially those who are all too readily sidelined.

“Discriminatory practices and outdated social and cultural norms must be left in the past for the energy transition to truly drive more successful economies for all members of the community,” says Irena.

This twelfth edition of the Annual Review is part of Irena’s extensive analytical work on the socioeconomic impacts of a renewables-based energy transition.

This is the fifth edition developed in collaboration with ILO.

Billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies support the system, which often harms the environment.

As President Donald Trump’s administration pushes a pro-ranching agenda, ProPublica and High Country News investigated how public lands ranching has evolved. We filed more than 100 public record requests and sued the Bureau of Land Management to pry free documents and data; we interviewed everyone from ranchers to conservationists; and we toured ranching operations in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada.

The resulting three-part investigation digs into the subsidies baked into ranching, the environmental impacts from livestock and the political clout that protects this status quo. Here are the takeaways from that work.

The system has evolved into a subsidy program for ranchers.

The public lands grazing system was modernized in the 1930s in response to the rampant use of natural resources that led to the Dust Bowl — the massive dust storms triggered by poor agricultural practices, including overgrazing. Today, the system focuses on subsidizing the continued grazing of these lands.

The BLM and Forest Service, the two largest federal land management agencies, oversee most of the system. Combined, the agencies charged ranchers $21 million in grazing fees in 2024. Our analysis found that to be about a 93% discount, on average, compared with the market rate for forage on private land. We also found that, in 2024 alone, the federal government poured at least $2.5 billion into subsidy programs that public lands ranchers can access. Such subsidies include disaster assistance after droughts and floods as well as compensation for livestock lost to predators.

A small number of wealthy individuals and corporations manage most livestock on public lands. Roughly two-thirds of the grazing on BLM acreage is controlled by just 10% of ranchers, our analysis found. And on Forest Service land, the top 10% of permittees control more than 50% of grazing. Among the largest ranchers are billionaires like Stan Kroenke and Rupert Murdoch, as well as mining companies and public utilities. The financial benefits of holding permits to graze herds on public lands extend beyond cattle sales. Even hobby ranches can qualify for property tax breaks in many areas; ranching business expenses can be deducted from federal taxes; and private property associated with grazing permits is a stable long-term investment. (Representatives of Kroenke did not respond to requests for comment, and Murdoch’s representative declined to comment.)

The Trump administration is supercharging the system, including by further increasing subsidies.

The administration released a “plan to fortify the American Beef Industry” in October that instructed the BLM and Forest Service to amend grazing regulations for the first time since the 1990s. The plan suggested that taxpayers further support ranching by increasing subsidies for drought and wildfire relief, livestock killed by predators and government-backed insurance. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Livestock grazing is not only a federally and statutorily recognized appropriate land use, but a proven land management tool, one that reduces invasive species and wildfire risk, enhances ecosystem health, and supports rural stewardship.” Roughly 18,000 permittees graze livestock on BLM or Forest Service land, most of them small operations. These ranchers say they need government support and cheaper grazing fees to avoid insolvency.

The administration is loosening already lax oversight.

Ranchers must renew their permits to use public lands every 10 years, including undergoing an environmental review. But Congress passed a law in 2014 that allows permits to be automatically renewed if federal agencies are unable to complete such reviews. In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, our analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about an additional 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review.

This is in large part because the BLM’s rangeland management staff is shrinking. The number of these employees dropped 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data, and roughly 1 in 10 rangeland staff left the agency between Trump’s election win and last June, according to BLM records.

The system allows widespread environmental harm in the West.

The BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands open to grazing, and assessments it conducts on the health of the environment found that grazing had degraded at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. The agency has no record of land health assessments for an additional 35 million acres. ProPublica and High Country News observed overgrazing in multiple states, including streambeds trampled by cattle, grasslands denuded by grazing and creeks fouled by cow corpses.

Ranchers contend that public lands grazing has ecological benefits, such as preventing nearby private lands from being sold off and paved over. Bill Fales and his family, for example, run cattle in western Colorado and have done so for more than a century. “The wildlife here is dependent on these ranches staying as open ranch land,” he said. While development destroyed habitat nearby, Fales said, the areas his cattle graze are increasingly shared by animals such as elk, bears and mountain lions.

Regulators say that it’s difficult to significantly change the system because of the industry’s political influence.

We interviewed 10 current and former BLM employees, from upper management to rank-and-file rangeland managers, and they all spoke of political pressure to go easy on ranchers. “If we do anything anti-grazing, there’s at least a decent chance of politicians being involved,” one BLM employee told us. “We want to avoid that, so we don’t do anything that would bring that about.” A BLM spokesperson said in a statement that “any policy decisions are made in accordance with federal law and are designed to balance economic opportunity with conservation responsibilities across the nation’s public lands.”

The industry has friends in high places. The Trump administration appointed to a high-level post at the U.S. Department of the Interior a lawyer who has represented ranchers in cases against the government and owns a stake in a Wyoming cattle operation.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it was setting up a procedure for automakers to volunteer limits on the number of electric vehicles they ship from China to Europe.
“We have said from the start, as the European Commission, as the investigative authority in this case, that we’re willing to look at alternatives to the anti-subsidy duties we put in place,” said Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission.
Each automaker’s plan would have to be approved separately not only by the European Commission but also by member countries of the European Union — a potentially lengthy process.
In exchange, Volkswagen asked the European Commission to stop collecting its 20.7 percent anti-subsidy tariff on the Cupra.","The European Commission and China’s Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday guidance that could lead to the removal of tariffs on some electric vehicles imported from China, notably Volkswagen's Cupra Tavascan.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it was setting up a procedure for automakers to volunteer limits on the number of electric vehicles they ship from China to Europe. The automakers would also set minimum prices for which they would sell these cars.

Automakers that do limit the number of imported electric vehicles and pledge price floors could be exempt from the anti-subsidy tariffs of up to 35 percent that the European Commission imposed in late 2024 on electric cars from China.

“We have said from the start, as the European Commission, as the investigative authority in this case, that we’re willing to look at alternatives to the anti-subsidy duties we put in place,” said Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission.

The framework announced on Monday came as Europe was looking to develop more trade ties with regions other than the United States in response to President Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs and other initiatives.

But European leaders face a quandary. The United States is the only country in recent years that has been willing to run extremely large trade deficits, which has made the American market enticing for European exporters. China has severely limited purchases from Europe through a wide-ranging program of domestic production to replace imports.

Any arrangement for automakers to avoid paying the tariffs on E.V. shipments to Europe may not take effect quickly. Each automaker’s plan would have to be approved separately not only by the European Commission but also by member countries of the European Union — a potentially lengthy process.

The new procedure comes after Volkswagen broke ranks this winter with the Chinese car industry by volunteering to limit shipments to Europe of its Cupra electric cars from its factory in Hefei, China, and to set an undisclosed minimum price for the Cupras when they arrived in Europe.

In exchange, Volkswagen asked the European Commission to stop collecting its 20.7 percent anti-subsidy tariff on the Cupra. The commission’s move on Monday sets a procedure for reviewing such requests by automakers.

“We’ve issued this guidance because, in December, the first meaningful offer on a price undertaking came,” Mr. Gill, the commission’s spokesman, said. “We’ve taken the decision to issue this more detailed additional guidance in the event that other offers will come.”

China’s Ministry of Commerce has contended that automakers with factories in China should negotiate as a bloc with the European Commission, and should not submit their own offers. If automakers make separate proposals, they might compete against each other over concessions to Europe.

The Chinese ministry took a different stance late last year when seeking its own concessions from foreign producers. The ministry demanded that brandy producers in Europe each submit their own offers to set price limits on their sales to China.

European trade officials have been wary of accepting deals that allow automakers to set high minimum prices for their electric cars. That could allow automakers to fix prices and pocket the profits from limited sales in Europe instead of paying tariffs.

The European Commission reached a similar deal in 2013 for Chinese solar panel manufacturers to set high minimum prices in the European market in exchange for avoiding tariffs. The Chinese solar industry reaped large profits from these high prices and invested the money in new factories.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12biz-eu-china-ev1-wbqt/12biz-eu-china-ev1-wbqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 07:59:24.365715

Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextpower, said: “Saudi Arabia is a strategic market for Nextpower as we expand our ability to serve customers across the Middle East.”

Nextpower unveiled the JV with Saudi-based energy company Abunayyan Holding back in October 2025. The goal of this new JV is to accelerate the deployment of utility-scale solar PV plants across the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region.

Over the next two years, both companies forecast to fund the JV with nearly US$88 million in equity and public and private debt financings. According to Nextpower, the capital will help facilitate the buildout of the manufacturing facility and the development of high-skilled technical and engineering capabilities.

On top of providing advanced tracker systems with its manufacturing facility, Nextpower Arabia also aims to provide yield management and control solutions for installation on large-scale solar PV projects across the MENA region.

Nextpower already has a notable presence in the region, having delivered more than 6GW of tracking systems and software over the years, including for Phase V of the 900MW Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in the UAE and 3GW of projects in Saudi Arabia.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding CEO and Nextpower Arabia Chairman and CEO, said: “Our manufacturing facility represents the first step in our strategic vision to strengthen and localise the solar supply chain for our partners across the MENA region and enhance collaboration to deliver highly efficient and cost-effective clean energy.”

Al-Amri added that the facility will source Saudi-produced steel through strategic partnerships and local manufacturing.

Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta, added: “Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.
State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI.
The agreement includes the rights for Meta for energy for up to six additional units.
Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO, said: “To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s.","Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta announced that it has signed a series of large-scale nuclear power agreements, supporting up to 6.6 GW of energy by 2035 and enabling the social media and technology giant to help meet the energy demand of its rapidly growing data center footprint in the U.S., while maintaining progress on its clean energy and sustainability goals.

The announcement includes two deals to support the development of new advanced nuclear facilities by TerraPower and Oklo, and 20-year agreements with power company Vistra to purchase energy from and expand the capacity of existing nuclear power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Each of the new agreements resulted from a U.S.-focused nuclear RFP process launched by Meta in late 2024, as part of the company’s pivot to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations.

Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 climate goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.”

Following the launch of the RFP, Meta announced its first large-scale agreement with Constellation Energy in June 2025, extending the life of a nuclear energy facility in Illinois for 20 years to supply 1.1 GW of output to support Meta’s operations in the region.

Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta, added:

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.”

Meta’s new agreement with TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company started by Bill Gates, Nathan Myhrvold and John Gilleland, will provide funding to support the development of two new “Natrium” plants, which each combine a 345 MW sodium fast reactor with a molten salt energy storage system that can retain large amounts of energy that can be used to power the grid at peak demand when weather or darkness reduce renewable output.

While providing a baseload of 345 MW, each plants’ built-in storage system can boost energy delivery to up to 500 MW for over five hours. The agreement includes the rights for Meta for energy for up to six additional units. Delivery of the additional units is anticipated for as early as 2032.

Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO, said:

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs.”

California-based Oklo is developing next-generation fission power plants that can be fueled by recycled waste, while also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories. The agreement with Meta will support Oklo’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW power campus in Pike County, Ohio, providing funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project, targeted to come online as early as 2030, with the project expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to full capacity by 2034.

Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO described the new funding commitment from Meta as “a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward.”

DeWitte added:

“Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra’s agreements with Meta include 20-year PPAs for more than 2.6 GW of zero-carbon energy from 3 nuclear plants, including 2,176 MW of operating generation from 2 operating plants in Ohio, and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases from the Ohio plants, as well as from an additional plant in Pennsylvania, marking the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the U.S. to date. Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034.

Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra, said:

“When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution – to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today and we’re investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.”

When the Power Fails, Adaptation Fails That is why renewable energy is one of the most practical and life-saving adaptation measures of our time.
Renewable energy remains poorly integrated into global adaptation frameworks, energy resilience is rarely tracked through adaptation indicators and policies on energy, development and adaptation remain misaligned.
That means directing finance to decentralized renewable systems, integrating renewable energy into national resilience planning and ensuring that adaptation frameworks fully capture their impact.
Climate adaptation should not just be about rebuilding after disaster; it should primarily be about keeping societies functioning, resilient and thriving.","Climate adaptation is often described in terms of seawalls, drought-resistant crops or early warning systems. But in the places already living through intensifying heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, adaptation comes down to something far more fundamental: whether or not the power stays on. Without energy, hospitals fail, water stops flowing, lines of communications faulter and recovery gets stalled before it can even begin.

REN21’s latest strategic intelligence brief, Renewables for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, shows that adaptation has become a central pillar of economic and social resilience given intensifying climate change.

However, the brief warns that without effective adaptation, 18%-23% of global GDP could be lost by 2050, exposing nearly 20% of the global population to high climate risks. Communities around the world are already facing severe impacts from extreme weather, disrupting infrastructure, supply chains and essential services as well as their socio-economic consequences.

When the Power Fails, Adaptation Fails

That is why renewable energy is one of the most practical and life-saving adaptation measures of our time. Communities on the frontlines understood this long before global policy frameworks did.

In the Marshall Islands, repeated blackouts once shut down water, sanitation and communications for days at a time. For a country facing rising seas and saltwater intrusion, this was more than inconvenient. It was dangerous. As the government began scaling up decentralized renewables, the motivation was straightforward: survival. Renewable energy became energy security, and energy security became adaptation.

The Caribbean reached the same conclusion from experience. When Hurricane Melissa tore through Jamaica, some households equipped with rooftop solar systems that withstood the storm were able to continue generating electricity, keeping essentials like refrigerators running even as the central grid failed. Unfortunately, solar is still out of reach for many in Jamaica. However, falling prices, new tax credits, wider financing options and compensation for excess electricity that is fed into the grid are expanding access and supporting Jamaica’s goal of sourcing half of its electricity from renewables by 2030. As Caricom’s climate envoy put it, renewables have become “an important line of defense when the lights go out and when hurricanes strike.” These stories are repeated across small islands, rural regions and remote communities worldwide.

The pattern is clear: Vulnerability is also an energy problem. And renewables reduce vulnerability faster and more reliably than systems dependent on imported fuel and long supply chains.

This is not only a humanitarian or environmental argument. It is an economic one. Uruguay’s nearly 100% renewable electricity system now saves the country roughly $500 million each year and supports around 50,000 jobs. By eliminating exposure to global fuel price spikes, the country has built both economic and climate resilience. Its experience shows that renewables strengthen national budgets as much as they strengthen infrastructure.

The Economic Case for Energy Resilience

Meanwhile, many countries face rising energy demand alongside escalating climate impacts. Adaptation finance remains far below what economies require, and every disruption carries real economic costs. In this context, decentralized renewables offer an unusually effective form of risk reduction. They keep critical services running when extreme weather hits, and they lower long-term energy expenses. They are both resilience infrastructure and economic stabilizer.

Yet, despite their proven role, renewables have often been treated as a mitigation tool rather than a foundation of adaptation. That mindset is changing. A growing number of countries now explicitly link renewable energy with adaptation in their National Adaptation Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This shift reflects experience rather than theory. According to REN21’s strategic intelligence brief, countries that integrate renewables into adaptation planning do so because decentralized and diversified energy systems perform better under climate stress.

What emerges is a clear pattern. Governments are prioritizing renewable systems that reduce dependence on central grids, imported fuels and long supply chains, all of which are vulnerable to extreme weather. Distributed solar, mini- and microgrids, small-scale hydropower and household-level solutions are increasingly recognized as tools to keep essential services running when shocks hit. At the same time, countries are diversifying renewable energy sources to manage climate risks, particularly where changing rainfall patterns are undermining hydropower reliability. In practice, renewables are being treated not only as clean energy but as resilience infrastructure.

Closing the Gap Between Practice and Policy

Yet, the brief also highlights a growing disconnect between what is working on the ground and how adaptation is planned, financed and measured. Renewable energy remains poorly integrated into global adaptation frameworks, energy resilience is rarely tracked through adaptation indicators and policies on energy, development and adaptation remain misaligned. As a result, renewables-based adaptation is often underfunded and undercounted despite its proven ability to reduce risk and economic losses.

The evidence is overwhelming: When energy systems are local, diversified and independent of fuel supply chains, communities and economies are better protected. Countries are also recognizing the economic returns: Adaptation investments can boost GDP by up to 15 percentage points by 2050, while renewables-based resilience reduces recovery costs and fiscal exposure after climate shocks.

Now the task is to match practice with policy. Post-COP30, governments, development banks and climate funds have an opportunity to bring energy security into the heart of adaptation strategies. That means directing finance to decentralized renewable systems, integrating renewable energy into national resilience planning and ensuring that adaptation frameworks fully capture their impact.

Climate adaptation should not just be about rebuilding after disaster; it should primarily be about keeping societies functioning, resilient and thriving. On that measure, renewables are no longer a peripheral solution. They are critical infrastructure, and the world can no longer afford to treat them as anything less.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d912fc8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+35/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F89%2F193a17a1434e818ed5db1a8a4a59%2Fss-2334121883-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:03:21.920980

By supporting new approaches to key problems - storing renewable energy, extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and the huge carbon footprint of some industrial processes - these Fellowships are empowering researchers to tackle global warming.’

Professor Robert House will use the Fellowship funding to develop a new type of battery that is four times more energy dense than current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, thereby making them much lighter and powerful - and suitable for use in electric or hybrid aeroplanes. Using nanoengineering, the new battery will overcome the challenges presented by their Li-ion counterparts which carry a lot of excess unused weight in the electrode materials. Increasing the practical energy density four-fold will mean that batteries will be made much smaller and lighter, which could help electrify air travel.

He said: ‘The long-term Green Future Fellowship funding will allow me to launch an ambitious new research programme to develop novel battery concepts to meet the stringent performance and safety requirements for aerospace. This high-risk, high-reward research could transform the way we travel by air by making aeroplanes quieter and less polluting at airports, reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in the high atmosphere, and increasing the range of electric flying taxis. The technology could also have a wider impact on EVs as well as heavy goods, construction and mining vehicles, improving their power and driving range.’

Professor Moritz Riede will focus on accelerating the commercialisation of organic photovoltaics (OPV), to provide clean energy anywhere in the world at a fraction of the environmental footprint of traditional solar panels. OPV are solar cells made from carbon-based earth abundant raw materials. Being lightweight and flexible, they could be used for applications unsuitable for traditional solar panels such as curved surfaces or in transparent glass facades. But whilst OPV have exceeded 20% efficiency in the laboratory, commercial panels remain at around 8-9%.

Professor Riede will combine automation and machine learning to develop production methods for 20+% efficient OPV that work reliably at industrial manufacturing scale, closing the gap between laboratory and factory. This will accelerate OPV commercialisation - supporting UK Net Zero goals, creating jobs, and advancing a fair clean energy transition everywhere.

He said: ‘We know organic photovoltaics work very well in the lab. The challenge is achieving the same at scale in factories in a way that is both fast and affordable. That is what the climate urgency demands right now and that is what we are solving. Focusing on industrially relevant materials and proven processes, we aim to scale organic photovoltaics, the greenest and most equitable form of solar energy reaching low-, middle- and high-income countries alike.’

Professor James Naismith, Head of the Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences (MPLS) Division at Oxford University, said: ‘These Green Future Fellowships recognise the power of fundamental science and engineering to address one of the defining challenges of our time.

The Solution: Behind-the-Meter Microgrids

Independence Power deploys behind-the-meter microgrids in the form of battery energy storage systems, or “BESS”, that function as private, on-site power stations.

241 MW, 104-unit Deployed BESS Fleet: With 241 megawatts (MW) of energized, utility-scale batteries already under management, Independence Power's proprietary software acts as a ""shock absorber"" to stabilize power.

Uptime for AI and Oil: This setup ensures the near-perfect power quality needed for both upstream oil production and high-density AI data centers co-located at the source.

Immediate Deployment: Because these systems are behind-the-meter, they bypass the 30-month interconnection delays often seen with traditional grid power.

Fueling with Byproduct: Independence Power’s solutions enable capturing natural gas produced as a byproduct of oil drilling and converting it into low-cost electricity right at the source.

Strengthening National Energy Security

Independence Power’s solutions directly improve National Energy Security by ensuring the Permian Basin—responsible for 50% of America’s oil production—remains insulated from grid volatility. By stabilizing the power supply for the nation's most vital energy hub, Independence Power helps protect American energy independence from foreign pressures and domestic grid failure.

Addressing a 13 Gigawatt Power Gap

The Permian Basin is currently outgrowing its regional power grid. According to a comprehensive demand forecast conducted by S&P Global for the Texas energy grid operator, ERCOT, the Permian Basin is currently grappling with a power shortfall of 8 to 13 gigawatts. This gap creates ""dirty power""—voltage sags and surges that frequently crash industrial computers and damage high-value equipment.

High-Margin Recurring Revenue

With decades of experience in oil field logistics, founder David J. Durrett empowered Independence Power with an asset-light business model, seeking to generate high-margin recurring revenue as a Power-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider. Independence Power provides the proprietary software ""brain"" developed specifically for the extreme conditions of the West Texas desert to orchestrate these microgrids.

""Our proprietary software was born in the desert to solve the most difficult power challenges in the oil patch,"" said Todd Parkin, CEO of Independence Power. ""By pairing this technology with our customer’s 241 MW battery fleet, we are providing the stable, recurring energy backbone for both oilfield productivity and the AI revolution.”

The proposal would require approval from state lawmakers, who are set to negotiate the broader California budget ahead of a July deadline. Details on the new program, including the amount of individual rebates and which cars would be eligible, are still being discussed, said Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Buckley said in an email.

Newsom has gone back-and-forth on using California resources to backfill the federal EV tax credits Trump cut. An initial 2024 proposal had market-share caps that would have excluded Tesla Inc.’s best-selling models, drawing the ire of Elon Musk who called the plan “insane.” The proposal was later dropped as California’s budget gap widened, with Newsom then saying that the state “wouldn’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

California is the biggest EV market in the country and Newsom’s proposal could be a boon for struggling manufacturers.

Tesla and other automakers reported slowdowns and declines in electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter after the loss of federal incentives, following a rush from EV buyers taking advantage of an expired $7,500 federal credit.

Led by a team of Rose-Hulman faculty, the project seeks to leverage Terre Haute's unique intellectual and industrial resources to fill a gap in STEM education and to create a pipeline to the workforce. Rose-Hulman Alfred R. Schmidt Endowed Chair for Excellence in Teaching & Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Jenny Mueller, PhD, delivered the winning pitch.

Rose-Hulman students, working closely with industry partners, will develop educational STEM kits and modules to pique the interests of students in grades 3-5 who may not currently see themselves in STEM fields or have an understanding of what a career in STEM might look like. The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange aims to support regional talent pipeline needs by inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders and learners.

A nod to Terre Haute's nickname as the ""Crossroads of America,"" the name of the project symbolizes the intersection and connection among Rose-Hulman, community partners, and industry partners. Designed in collaboration with several stakeholders, including North American Lighting, the Terre Haute Children's Museum, and the 14th and Chestnut Community Center in Terre Haute, the project is a step toward building a stronger STEM community identity.

""Our project seeks to bring meaningful STEM activities to children in community spaces outside of their schools,"" said Rose-Hulman Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Rebecca Bercich, PhD. ""This will address several barriers to STEM engagement and mentorship.""

Mueller serves as principal investigator on the grant, with support from Bercich; Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Kelley Dugan, PhD; Associate Dean of Professional Development and Professor of English Rich House, PhD; and Chief Director of Institutional Research, Planning, and Assessment and Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering Matt Lovell, PhD.

Rose-Hulman faculty and students, in conjunction with community and industry partner representatives, created the original pitch at the Community Engaged Alliance's Idea2Action September 2025 event, where they received actionable feedback and strong encouragement to continue pursuing this project. Students Jorge Luis Sol Casas, Jayne McCormack, Beej Bowling, and Stevie Irvine, co-authored and delivered this pitch.

In addition to providing quality educational materials to youth, the project also seeks to increase Rose-Hulman students' understanding of community context and civic identity. First-year mechanical engineering students in select sections of the Introduction to Design course will create the STEM education kits.

""How do you know if you know something? You can explain it clearly to someone younger than you,"" said Bercich. ""It also trains (Rose-Hulman students) in audience analysis, empathy, and adapting to non-technical audiences.""

By design, the Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange seeks to be more grounded in its community than existing STEM educational materials. Throughout the design process, the Rose-Hulman students will work in conjunction with an industry partner, such as North American Lighting, to develop hands-on activities that reflect authentic industry practice, as well as with the Terre Haute Children's Museum to ensure age-appropriate interactivity.

Faculty and student volunteers will facilitate the STEM kit modules over the summer at Terre Haute's 14th & Chestnut Community Center, which provides afterschool and summer programming in a safe space for children in historically underserved neighborhoods.

""For some students, it would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spark an interest or learn more,"" said Connor Scanlon, director of the 14th and Chestnut Center. ""(It's a) really good opportunity or experience that they are not going to have anywhere else.""

Three of the most prevalent barriers to accessing STEM education include transportation, expertise, and resources, including both time and funding. The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange seeks to overcome those barriers by meeting students at a community location they already visit, connecting local industries and universities to underserved neighborhoods, and volunteering student and faculty time to make a difference in the community.

The Crossroads STEM Kit Exchange positions Rose-Hulman and Terre Haute as a nexus of curiosity and innovation, building and leveraging knowledge and partnerships across the community for mutual growth.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20240806-150136-248-rose-hulman.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 09:58:50.249962

Is there a growing awareness of the role of data analytics, and what do you think are the next steps for analytics providers?
With tougher operating economics and growing portfolios, operators are paying more attention to data and analytics.
This year, the industry must turn BESS data into a strategic advantage for proactive management of fleet-scale operations.
The Energy Storage Summit USA will be held from 24-25 March 2026, in Dallas, TX.","The two companies will offer customers in ERCOT an integrated offering that combines TWAICE’s insights into performance, safety, and lifecycle with Modo Energy’s market data on BESS asset performance. This offering aims to enable more accurate, asset-specific data calculation of revenues at the exact settlement point.

Hinrichs tells Energy-Storage.news that legislative and financial constraints faced by the US energy storage industry in 2025 were a “wake-up call,” highlighting the need to leverage data insights and for projects to be as coordinated and efficient as possible, all while maximising revenue-generating activities.

What did 2025 mean for the industry?

2025 saw record solar and storage deployment as developers rushed to qualify projects ahead of major rule changes in the United States. At the same time, higher interest rates, shifting tariffs, and new laws made projects more expensive and harder to finance. While the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ (‘OBBBA’) preserved incentives for battery storage, it also shifted the goalposts for them with more restrictive tax credits and foreign-entity rules.

That combination didn’t just slow deals: it changed what success looks like for the BESS industry.

What do you think 2026 will hold, in terms of both things to look forward to and in terms of challenges ahead?

The positives are that the industry is maturing, with operators no longer relying on crude and self-made tools to optimise dispatch and identify stranded capacity. Operators who ‘get’ data right can turn their growing BESS portfolios into success stories. Solutions will focus on operational outcomes, versus project delivery alone.

The challenges, on the other hand, are as follows:

Scaling problems could get worse as portfolios grow — multiple integrators, differing data connections and cell chemistries break pilot workflows.

State of charge (SOC) accuracy and imbalance detection remain challenging.

Derating (when parts of a site can’t deliver promised power) leads to penalties.

Contractual disputes over responsibility become more common.

Is there a growing awareness of the role of data analytics, and what do you think are the next steps for analytics providers?

Absolutely. With tougher operating economics and growing portfolios, operators are paying more attention to data and analytics.

As providers, we must focus on system-level analytics. While cell-level data is important, the most relevant metric for owners is what occurs at the point of interconnection (POI); analytics should therefore monitor the entire chain, including modules, racks, power conversion system (PCS), and transformers, to account for round-trip efficiency (RTE) and grid delivery requirements.

We also need to provide a ‘single pane of glass’ at fleet scale. As asset owners scale from pilot projects to gigawatt-hour portfolios, analytics tools must be able to handle billions of data points daily across diverse technologies and multiple integrators and present workflows, for both engineers and financial asset managers.

Analytics providers must move from reactive to proactive operations. Analytics should move away from merely alerting to automated, prescriptive actions that prevent downtime and penalties, translate failure modes into dollar impact (e.g., US$/MWh, avoided fines), and provide audit-ready evidence for lenders, insurers, and warranty claims.

What are the most challenging questions BESS developers need analytics to answer?

To give you a list:

Why is this site derating and when will it happen?

When should we rebalance or recalibrate SOC versus accept a temporary performance hit?

Which exact module, cell or component caused a failure so we can file warranty claims?

How much usable energy actually reaches the grid meter (not just DC-side numbers)?

Can analytics not only identify the root cause but also recommend and prioritize the right remediation steps?

We heard in the 2025 BESS Pros Survey from TWAICE that the role of analytics is shifting from a primary one of delivering safe operations to actively monetising storage assets. What does that really mean, and how can the industry best support this shift?

It means operators want assets that consistently earn revenue, not just assets that avoid incidents. To support that shift, you need: reliable, enriched telemetry; analytics that convert health and availability into dollars (expected revenue, avoided penalties); data ownership and a clean database to prove underperformance or support warranty claims; and cross-functional teams (ops, trading, finance) who share one source of truth.

What should the industry prioritise in 2026 and beyond?

Last year’s legislative and financing constraints were a wake-up call. Projects are now judged on predictable revenue and bankability, not just cost or speed.

This year, the industry must turn BESS data into a strategic advantage for proactive management of fleet-scale operations. To make that shift, the industry should focus on operationalising its data.

Operationalising data requires three steps. The first is to own the data, by ensuring reliable access to POI, system, and component telemetry across integrators and vendors.

The second is to create a single source of truth: normalising and centralising operational data so teams see a single, consistent view across sites and chemistries. The third and last is to turn high-volume data into a decision engine, in other words, converting standardised operational data into predictive KPIs, automated alerts and prescriptive workflows, so teams act proactively to prevent deratings, reduce safety risks, and maximise revenue.

The Energy Storage Summit USA will be held from 24-25 March 2026, in Dallas, TX. It features keynote speeches and panel discussions on topics like FEOC challenges, power demand forecasting, and managing the BESS supply chain.

The findings showcased that nuclear power – specifically NuScale NPMs – can help industries that use process steam and electricity in a reliable and profitable manner.

“As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity,” said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. “As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale’s scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study and the exciting new opportunities that small modular reactors introduce.”

Over the past two years, engineers from NuScale and ORNL partnered to form a composite engineering team. The group performed a TEA of nuclear and natural gas as energy sources for a number of steam and power generation configurations, including NPMs, gas boilers, and combined use, to meet the chemical plant’s steam and power demand with the most reliable and cost-competitive integrated energy system. The study utilized actual chemical plant conditions and historical data.

This assessment, a follow-on to an earlier study1 conducted using NuScale’s 50 MWe design, was based on NuScale’s NRC-approved uprated 77 MWe/250 MWt NPM design with a high-temperature, high-pressure, steam heat augmentation system. This new study used NuScale’s design with revised capital costs, a 10-day refueling outage time, reduced plant staffing, higher capacity factors, and a site boundary Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) methodology. The study examined factors such as steam reliability, operational costs, and system stability.

Upon completion of the comprehensive two-year study, the following key findings were reported:

The hybrid NPM/gas integrated energy system has a scalable architecture that offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability.

The 12-NPM plant is the most profitable, allowing the sale of excess power to the grid.

A minimum configuration of 4-NPMs combined with boilers can meet all of the chemical plant requirements.

An 8-NPM configuration allows for N-2 redundancy for very high reliability.

A wide range of hybrid combinations (NPMs with gas-fired boilers) are both viable and profitable.

The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet the chemical plant requirements – specifically 1.3 million kg/h of process steam, at 400°C (752°F), and 4.1 MPa (595 psia) – while also providing 73 MW of electric power.

Excess power generated could be exported to the grid for increased profitability for any combination.

The NPM with steam heat augmentation used highly-reliable, commercially available equipment to minimize costs and the use of high-temperature materials.

The TEA project was sponsored by the U.S. DOE’s GAIN program, and the ORNL report (ORNL/TM-2025/3938) with the assessment results for the integration of a NuScale SMR steam heat augmentation system with a chemical plant is now publicly available at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information.

,EPA,2026-01-12 11:43:33+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement has picked up steam in statehouses. Here's what to expect in 2026.,Not Available,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-maha-health-states/,"It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.
In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
""It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,"" Baker-White said.
""If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,"" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker.","When one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.

""We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,"" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. ""There are real impacts on real kids.""

The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.

The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.

Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as ""forever chemicals"" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.

Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.

Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.

""We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,"" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.

This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

""The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,"" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.

Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.

""It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,"" Baker-White said.

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP, or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.

There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.

""There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,"" Baker-White said.

In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It's a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling ""harmful and addictive"" products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas, and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.

Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don't agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven't focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans' championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.

Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.

Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.

""If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,"" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. ""We're going to step up as states and do the right thing.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/09/5d171f8c-3033-4a04-8463-044d70a77faa/thumbnail/1200x630g2/357cf794433729dfa561ad7c25453d25/2026-01-08t180405z-1889166885-rc24xia3yfn1-rtrmadp-3-usa-health-diet.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 08:58:39.180097

For the foreseeable future, the United States is no longer part of the global community trying to slow the Earth’s warming.","By pulling the United States out of the main international climate treaty, seizing Venezuelan crude oil and using government power to resuscitate the domestic coal industry while choking off clean energy, the Trump administration is not just ignoring climate change, it is likely making the problem worse.

President Trump has never been shy about rejecting the scientific reality of global warming: It’s a “hoax,” he has said, a “scam,” and a “con job.”

In recent days his administration has slammed the door on every possible avenue of global cooperation on the environment. At the same time, it is sending the message that it wants the world to be awash in fossil fuels sold by America, no matter the consequences.

The moves follow one of the hottest years on record, during which scientists say climate change supercharged raging wildfires in Los Angeles, deadly flooding in Texas, and a Category 5 hurricane that ravaged Caribbean islands.

The planet is on course to heat up more than 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the risks of catastrophic storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves, as well as species extinction, increase significantly. The Earth has already warmed by between 1.3 and 1.4 degrees Celsius.

Under President Trump, the United States has become the only nation to renege on a pledge to try to keep warming to 1.5 degrees. Its actions will make the global fight harder, scientists said.

“Emissions will be higher,” warned Justin S. Mankin, an associate professor at Dartmouth College who researches climate variability. “Trump’s greenhouse gas emissions will cause Trump’s heat waves, Trump’s droughts, Trump’s floods, and Trump’s wildfires.”

America’s carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas, which have made it the biggest polluter since the start of the Industrial Age, had been declining steadily since 2007. But last year, after Mr. Trump returned to the White House, emissions rose 1.9 percent, according to the federal government.

Researchers attributed the rise to an increased use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Scientists said U.S. emissions should ultimately decline again, in large part because renewable energy remains cheaper than fossil fuels. But the decrease could be slower and smaller than a safe atmosphere requires.

“The science is clear that every action matters and every ton of carbon matters,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech. “There’s a price to pay for every ton of carbon we produce, and that price is being added to our global debt.”

On Wednesday Mr. Trump announced that he was withdrawing the United States from a long list of United Nations organizations, including the treaty that underpins international cooperation on global warming and a Nobel Prize-winning group made up of the world’s leading climate scientists.

It came days after the U.S. seized control of Venezuela’s oil, the largest known supply in the world but a particularly “dirty” grade, which produces more greenhouse gases when burned than American oil.

And those were just the latest maneuvers. Over the past months, the administration has forced five domestic power plants that burn coal to continue operating despite their planned retirement. It also halted five offshore wind farms along the East Coast that are already partially built and were to provide clean energy to millions of homes and businesses.

Those moves capped a year in which the Trump administration systematically eliminated regulations designed to reduce greenhouses and gutted federal subsidies that could have brought more wind and solar power onto the grid. With Republican allies in Congress, the administration erased incentives to help consumers switch to nonpolluting electric cars from gasoline-burning vehicles. At the same time, federal agencies imposed new policies making it easier and cheaper to produce and burn oil, gas and coal.

Trump administration officials have insisted that investment in clean energy hurts the United States.

“When it comes to climate change we just chuck rationality at the door,” Chris Wright, the Energy secretary, said this week at a Goldman Sachs energy event in Miami. He claimed clean sources don’t produce enough energy and don’t reduce emissions, calling it “the greatest malinvestment in human history.”

Scientists disagreed.

“In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined that the Trump administration would do the level of destruction they have tried to do to the development of renewable energy in this country,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. “Why didn’t I think it imaginable? Because it’s not rational.”

Dr. Oppenheimer said the totality of Trump administration actions could lead to either a rise in U.S. emissions or a slowing of their decline. The severity of the climate consequences depends upon how long the policies stay in place.

Calculating the potential impact of the Trump administration on emissions is complicated by the fact that some of the changes to policy and regulations have not yet taken effect.

One study conducted by the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group, found that some of the biggest regulatory actions being taken by Mr. Trump could add 32 billion metric tons of additional climate pollution to the atmosphere by 2055, more than four times the country’s annual emissions today.

“The administration seems hellbent on blowing past ever more dangerous thresholds,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford climate scientist who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ climate emissions.

He noted that China and Europe are continuing to lead the world in addressing climate change, but said he worries about the signal Mr. Trump’s actions send globally.

“They won’t continue to act on their own forever if countries like the U.S. ignore the threat of climate change,” Dr. Jackson said.

As more distilleries become insolvent amid weakening demand, bankruptcy trustees tasked with raising as much money as possible to repay creditors face a problem: how to sell off alcohol that needs years of aging before it can be called straight bourbon. Anything before that point is raw distillate with far less value.

Bourbon is just one example of the increasingly eclectic, and often difficult to value, classes of assets being offered for sale through the bankruptcy marketplace. Alongside real estate, unused tax credits, intellectual property, and unpaid judgments, debtors across the financial spectrum have offered a 1990 Ferrari F40, private jets, thoroughbred horses, crypto accounts, and even batches of unused Starbucks gift cards.

The marketplace offers a window into a hidden corner of the economy, where conventional, unconventional, and emerging assets are priced, marketed, and sold under court supervision. What appears for sale often mirrors broader bankruptcy filings and financial stress.

Spirit Airlines, for instance, listed 23 aircraft for sale during its first bankruptcy in 2024 as travel demand softened after the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The economy dictates what we may see and what we may be selling, it’s debtor-driven,” Donald R. Lassman, an attorney and bankruptcy trustee in Massachusetts, said.

Most recently, a Claude Monet ‘Water Lilies’ painting from the collection of bankrupt hedge fund manager George Weiss showed up on Inforuptcy, a subscription website for professionals and distressed-asset investors that scans court documents and sale motions from the government’s online docket system and converts them into listings. Think Craigslist, only for bankruptcy assets.

Inforuptcy, a for-profit business founded in 2012, had about 8,000 listings last year.

“That’s the beauty of bankruptcy, any type of asset can come through the courts,” co-founder Michael Mikikian said. “There’s been crypto, $100 million homes, $100-plus-million companies. Everything flows through here.”

There are deals to be found, but low-ball offers generally won’t go anywhere. Every purchase must survive sale hearings, potential creditor objections, and approval from a judge—though court-approved sales have the advantage of being declared in good faith and free of most liens, claims, and other encumbrances.

“You must read the sale motion, maybe you have to show up to the hearing, or have a security deposit to bid,” Mikikian said.

The Monet

A Monet Nymphéas oil painting from between 1914 and 1917 is something you’d expect to see at a Christie’s or Sotheby’s auction. But since it was part of the Weiss bankruptcy estate, it went through a court-ordered sale.

“There is a limited universe of buyers who can put forward close to $40 million,” said Jennifer Morris, an art historian and attorney at Morris Art Law who represented the eventual buyer. “This isn’t your average art buyer.”

The Monet is one of the artist’s later works, marked by looser and thicker brushstrokes due to his declining eyesight, Morris said. Unlike earlier pieces, this one offers a top-down view onto the water, features pastel colors like violets and blues, and is notable for its balanced, almost square composition that draws the viewer’s eye directly to the center.

It lacks the complexity seen in Monet’s more significant later paintings of ‘Water Lilies,’ said David Shapiro, an art adviser with experience appraising the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts. They have richer color and “are more resolved paintings, with this painting looking more sketch-like by comparison,” he said.

As of late November, nine Monet paintings of ‘Water Lilies’ have sold at public auctions for more than $50 million, including buyer’s premium, he added.

The bankruptcy court ultimately approved the sale of Weiss’s Monet in October for $36.5 million. There were no competing bids after another deal fell through, when a potential buyer couldn’t secure funding.

The art world has crossed into bankruptcy before, most notably through Detroit’s “Grand Bargain,” launched to prohibit the sale of works from the then city-owned art institute to pay off debt and to help raise funds to protect pensions in 2014. And more recently, artwork from the Boy Scouts of America’s collection, including paintings by Norman Rockwell, was auctioned to raise money for a trust to compensate former Scouts who claimed they were sexually abused.

Shifting Marketplace

More asset categories, such as credits tied to emissions reduction programs and tax credits, are entering the market.

Among recent credit sellers is Nikola Corp., the electric-vehicle maker founded by Trevor Milton, who was convicted of securities and wire fraud and then pardoned last year by President Donald Trump. The company sold environmental credits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and California’s Air Resources Board for $15.3 million.

Manufacturers often buy these credits to comply with federal and state emissions and fuel-efficiency standards.

Tax credits can also be challenging to value, and some could create exposure for buyers, particularly when they are subject to recapture depending on their structure, use, and transfer.

“It’s notoriously difficult to value tax assets, as the tax laws can change at any time and often do change with new presidential administrations, and most credits can only be enjoyed if there’s future income to generate sufficient tax liability,” said Diane Lourdes Dick, who teaches business and tax law at the University of Iowa College of Law.

Other assets seemingly making a comeback, based on Inforuptcy listings, are judgments and claims. Judgments can be sold for $2,500 to $171,300, as in a recent listing. An employment discrimination claim against a health-care tech company was listed at $5,000.

David Pullman, CEO of the Pullman Group, contacts trustees seeking income streams of all kinds, such as music, book, and film and TV royalties, as well as oil and gas royalties. Getting that federal court order finding as a good faith buyer is a win, he explained.

“It’s helped us expedite things in terms of parties that need to pay us. Using a federal court order to resolve these matters works better than just relying on an agreement or assignment,” Pullman said. “You can run into more issues with just an assignment without a court order.”

Gregory G. Plotko, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg LLP in New York who often represents creditors and distressed asset buyers, said investment and credit funds are interested in “esoteric” assets such as class-action claims, tax refunds, and litigation claims. While the legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs is before the Supreme Court, claims for potential tariff reimbursements are being monetized as well, he said.

Due to liquidity constraints and financial needs, distressed companies “won’t wait to see what happens with the cases, if the government will really pay it back, or how long that will take,” Plotko said.

In his role as a trustee, Lassman sometimes prefers to sell judgments instead of trying to collect them to cut litigation costs. The market for judgments isn’t well-defined, he said, so he solicits offers rather than setting prices.

“I want to close the bankruptcy cases and get money to creditors as fast as I can, so it’s much better for me to discount or just to list it for sale and see what kind of offers I can get,” Lassman said.

Tricky Valuations

Intellectual property is a common bankruptcy asset, but valuation can be challenging because it often varies based on interest and market trends. Trademarks are especially difficult to value, said Christine H. McCarthy from Barnes & Thornburg in Washington.

While bankruptcy lets a company break many contracts or obligations attached to its assets, that’s not always true for trademark rights.

“A proper and complete valuation of an IP portfolio requires figuring out exactly what rights are involved and who owns them,” she said.

A recent example involves golf legend Jack Nicklaus, who is challenging his former golf services company’s bid to sell assets in bankruptcy. He claims he holds veto rights over the use, sale, or transfer of IP.

Trustees also struggle over what to do with crypto assets. “First, how do you find them?” Lassman said. “Assume you find them, how do you gain control so you can then sell them?”

With other assets, the challenge is the cost of holding them.

With a thoroughbred horse, “you can’t put it in a warehouse until some later time,” said Ellen Arvin Kennedy, a partner at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP in Kentucky. “But maximizing its value in a bankruptcy would be very difficult.”

The timing of bankruptcy may not align with thoroughbred sales seasons in which sellers benefit from competitive bidding among a large pool of buyers—typically spring and fall—and in the meantime, the estate must cover food, shelter, boarding, and other care to preserve the horses’ value, she added.

“Thoroughbred horses are notoriously difficult to value depending on how they perform, their lineage, how they’ve been trained, and who’s trained them, all those things sort of factor into their value,” Kennedy said.

Holding bourbon barrels until the liquor matures isn’t simple either. Warehousing costs money, and a trustee would need court approval to finance storage. The market is also narrow, with established distillers already tied to their own brands and flavor profiles and less likely to buy an untested product.

“Some investors may say, ‘I’ll buy it, pay for the warehouse space, and see what happens. Maybe bourbon weathers the storm, and by the time it is ready to sell, I can bottle it and make a profit,’” she said.

As for fine art, while the Monet may have been the first to appear on Inforuptcy, it wasn’t the last artwork.

Soon after came works by Sam Gilliam, Bob Thompson, and Norman Lewis, all from the bankruptcy estate of entertainment attorney Ronald E. Sweeney, a collector of African-American art who once represented rapper Lil Wayne.

At least one buyer has expressed interest in one of the paintings, according to a court filing, though talks slowed over the winter holidays.

If the works sell—and a judge is satisfied—the bankruptcy estate could net as much as $1.6 million.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/df75941/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fe3%2Fae45ab0e4bc089ff79bf63a5e82b%2Fbrowserpreview-tmp.png,N,,2026-01-12 11:02:42.323691

The arrangement provides that multinational groups headquartered in the US will be excluded from the majority of Pillar Two requirements, which in Ireland have been introduced through the EU Minimum Taxation Directive.

Under the agreed approach, jurisdictions that operate a minimum tax regime sharing comparable objectives and a similar scope to Pillar Two may be granted Side-by-Side status (SbS).

The documentation highlights that, in Ireland, qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes (QDMTTs) that are consistent with Pillar Two will continue to apply to Irish subsidiaries of US-based multinational groups.

This means that QDMTTs are expected to remain payable in Ireland, supporting the continuation of comparable tax outcomes across affected entities.

Congress is predominantly rejecting President Trump's proposal to dramatically slash natural resource agency budgets, according to bipartisan plans released this week that seek to uphold funding for national parks and forests, as well as energy and water infrastructure.

The fiscal year 2026 budget proposals for the Department of Energy, the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and key science agencies include small trims, but largely reject the major cuts the Trump administration outlined more than six months ago.

The president's request for the National Park Service, for example, would have cut $1 billion in funding. Instead, Congress is opting to keep funding nearly flat at $3.27 billion.

""We are really happy that appropriations leadership on the Republican and the Democratic side are making a very clear statement that our national parks should be supported in terms of funding and in terms of staffing,"" said John Garder, the senior director of budget and appropriations at the National Parks Conservation Association.

The organization estimated that the National Park Service has lost more than 24% of its permanent staff since the beginning of the Trump administration. Garder said the budget package requires public lands agencies to maintain the staffing levels needed to fulfill their missions.

The package has the support of Republican House leaders. It includes increased funding for oil and gas development, support for critical minerals extraction and investments to expand nuclear energy capacity.

""We prioritize American energy dominance and safeguarding critical mineral resources, national parks will be open and operating essential wildfire protection programs will remain in place,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said during a committee hearing Tuesday.

Lawmakers want to get the budgets over the finish line by the end of this month to avoid another government shutdown. Colorado's Democratic senators earlier said they intended to object to moving the budgets forward over the Trump administration's plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.

Within the framework of associated gas utilization plans and the reduction of methane and greenhouse gas emissions, Petroecuador continues to optimize its operations by using associated gas for electric power generation in its oil fields.

In blocks 44 (Pucuna) and 61 (Auca Sur), two power generation plants that use gas as fuel were put into operation, with an installed capacity of 300 kW and 4.000 kW, respectively. These plants make it possible to replace the use of diesel, considered one of the highest-value fuels in oil operations.

In block 61 (Auca Sur), gas consumption for power generation reaches 1.59 million standard cubic feet per day, which makes it possible to produce approximately 104,640 kwh of energy per day, generating an estimated annual saving of USD 7.21 million. Meanwhile, Block 44 produces 7,679.04 kwh per day, with savings of more than USD 500,000.

To that point, there are still several ongoing clean energy policies that are actively supporting solar companies in the United States. This includes tax credits for solar companies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has directly driven Array's expansion.

Furthermore, Array is indirectly benefiting from other domestic incentives for solar manufacturing as one of the world’s leading providers of solar tracker systems that are used in large-scale solar power plants. In other words, more utility-scale solar = more trackers = more demand for Array’s products.

Leadership Changes Signal Confidence

Array recently promoted two senior leaders: Darin Green to Global Chief Revenue Officer and Nick Strevel to Chief Product Officer. Moves like this often signal internal confidence and a push toward scaling revenue and product innovation, which can boost investor sentiment.

Right on cue, Array has announced that its North American segment is already showing significant improvement under the new Chief Revenue Officer’s leadership.

Array’s Increasing ROIC

Starting to suggest long-term shareholder value since going public in 2020, Array’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has seen a sharp uptick toward the often admirable level of 20% or higher. Showing the ability to effectively turn invested capital into profits, Array’s ROIC is currently at 19% and tops industry giant First Solar’s FSLR 13%.

Considering many solar companies are still in the early stages of their development, strong ROIC separates those that will potentially compound wealth from those that simply burn cash or waste resources.

Steady Growth & Attractive Valuation

Indicative of its future earnings potential, Array is already on the cusp of bringing in over $1 billion in annual sales, a rather robust top line for a stock that investors are paying under $10 a share for.

Array is thought to have ended fiscal 2025 with annual earnings rising 11% to $0.67 per share. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to soar another 44% to $0.97. The company will be reporting Q4 2025 results on February 26, after most recently crushing Q3 EPS and sales estimates by 42% and 25%, respectively.

More intriguing is that Array’s stock trades at 9X forward earnings, well below the Solar industry average of 18X and an even steeper discount to the benchmark S&P 500. ARRY is also trading at just 1X forward sales, with the industry average being closer to 2X and the S&P 500’s average at nearly 6X.

The expansion will see output at the facility grow from 98 million to 193 million gallons of bioethanol annually, boosting the production of key coproducts such as dried distillers grains and corn oil. Construction is expected to begin in March, with completion slated for late 2027.

Jeff Lautt, POET’s president and chief operating officer, described the project as a clear vote of confidence in both the biofuels sector and American agriculture.

He emphasised that the increased capacity will not only strengthen local farm markets by increasing corn demand, but also create good-paying rural jobs, with around 20 new full-time positions anticipated at the expanded plant.

The investment is timely, coming as global interest in cleaner, low-carbon fuels grows in response to climate and energy security concerns. Ethanol, typically blended with petrol to lower greenhouse gas emissions, remains a key component of renewable fuel strategies in the United States and abroad.

For farmers in the Shelbyville area, the doubling of capacity means significant new market opportunities, with the plant projected to demand millions more bushels of corn annually. Local economies are likely to benefit not just from the construction phase, but from the long-term economic stimulus provided by an expanded bioprocessing hub.

“The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the EIA wrote.
Additionally, some data center loads are extremely variable and rapidly changing, with power demands fluctuating quickly as compute workloads shift.
“Behind every data center, there’s a web of power decisions: where to build, how to connect, how to scale,” MacDowell said.
“Proper modeling and well-designed architectures can future-proof your data center power system plan.” Consider the seemingly straightforward decision about where to locate a data center.","At one level, the challenge of meeting load growth from data centers is straightforward. After all, the task is fundamentally about quickly delivering a substantial amount of electrons to data centers to power cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications (AI).

The sheer scale of the demand for electricity is enormous, especially for a utility industry that spent decades forecasting flat or even declining load growth. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) most recent short-term energy outlook (STEO) report forecast commercial electricity consumption to grow 3% in 2025 and 5% in 2026, a revision up from the annual increase of 2% EIA had previously projected.

“The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the EIA wrote. A report last year by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) reached similar conclusions, finding that the percentage of the nation’s electricity consumed by data centers could rise from 4.4% in 2023 to as much as 12% in 2028.

Complexity beyond scale

Utilities obviously want to serve data centers. However, the question for both utilities and data center developers is whether extremely large and reliable amounts of electricity can be provided within the required timeframe — speedy access to power is a key strategic imperative for data centers.

But the reality is that very little about meeting the enormous electricity demand from data centers is straightforward. For example, besides their sheer size, data centers have unique load characteristics, whether they’re being used to train new models or for inference, when trained AI models produce answers to questions users ask. Additionally, some data center loads are extremely variable and rapidly changing, with power demands fluctuating quickly as compute workloads shift.

This rapidly changing variability can put mechanical stress on a behind-the-meter or grid-connected but dedicated turbine. “That stress can cause a torsional pulsing or torsional vibration on the drive trains that could reduce the life of the shaft,” said Jason MacDowell, director of integrated systems for GE Vernova’s Consulting Services, referring to the long steel shaft connecting the turbine and the generator. “It could reduce the life of the equipment, and in extreme cases, if it’s not mitigated or if it’s not protected, it could even break the equipment.”

The menu of challenges data centers pose to utilities and the broad ecosystem of partners involved in delivering power also includes shifts between grid and backup power as well as the need for exceptional reliability — as high as 99.99% or even 99.999% of the time. It’s a task that requires careful and sophisticated planning capabilities able to weigh a staggering number of variables and uncertainties.

An integrated approach to planning

So how do utilities and developers navigate these and other challenges? The answer: with the help of sophisticated, integrated planning that accounts for not just grid conditions today, but for how those conditions will evolve over the next few decades. “Behind every data center, there’s a web of power decisions: where to build, how to connect, how to scale,” MacDowell said. “Proper modeling and well-designed architectures can future-proof your data center power system plan.”

Consider the seemingly straightforward decision about where to locate a data center. It would be simple to assume that the choice would come down to where a grid connection has sufficient capacity today. That’s clearly one factor to consider, but grid conditions also change, changes that can impact the reliability of power and the economics of a project.

Gene Hinkle, general manager, power economics for GE Vernova’s Consulting Services, recalls working with a data center developer trying to choose between two sites that looked similarly viable on paper. “When we ran our pricing and congestion forecast 15 years ahead, one site showed escalating costs that would have doubled their energy costs,” Hinkle recalled. “The other offered stable pricing and fewer downside risks. That insight turned what looked like a coin toss into a confident decision.”

Effective planning for the numerous power-related factors that can impact data centers requires a range of capabilities that analyze interdependent factors over decades — encompassing everything from data-driven infrastructure analysis to power flow dynamics, congestion risk, and locational marginal pricing.

Deep analysis extends beyond power availability. Hinkle recalls working with a large data center developer that was convinced it had the perfect site: good land, low-cost energy, and fiber connectivity nearby. GE Vernova’s risk modeling, however, identified flooding risk at the site and instead suggested an alternative location three miles away. “The move likely saved the client millions of dollars and years of delay,” Hinkle said. “Uncertainty is expensive.”

For integrated planning to be as valuable as possible, it should also be informed and guided by decades of expertise in utility and developer planning. The combination of sophisticated and holistic planning tools with deep industry expertise is particularly important because data center demand for reliable power is increasingly leading developers to consider on-site power solutions. “On one end of the spectrum, we’re working on totally islanded power system architectures where the data center, the substation, and the generation are completely isolated from the bulk grid,” said Yazan Al-Saif, director of integrated systems for data centers at GE Vernova’s Consulting Services.

This adds another layer of complexity that demands sophisticated planning able to answer challenging questions. How do you maintain grid stability under any scenario? Can on-site resources provide needed flexibility to the grid and, in certain cases, be used to take advantage of energy arbitrage opportunities? Even when utilities don’t especially welcome these on-site resources, they need to understand them and how they interact with grid operations.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GWMZMuC2HCP9RFC4sLtEarP14v9w6d851fh6eY59tuE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NTEwMDAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-12 08:13:42.796196

Soaring power demand from data centers and AI is colliding with an already strained electric grid.

As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal-generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

The 2025 average Henry Hub natural gas spot price increased 56% from the 2024 annual average, which – when adjusted for inflation – was the lowest on record. On a daily basis, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price ranged from US$2.65 per million Btu to US$9.86 million Btu, reflecting a narrower range of daily prices compared with the previous year.

Natural gas prices tend to be higher in winter months, when colder winter temperatures lead to more demand for natural gas, both directly for space heating and indirectly because natural gas is also the most prevalent source of electricity generation in the US. Demand for US LNG exports also rose by an estimated 3 billion ft3/d in 2025 as US LNG export capacity increased.

Lower prices over the summer were driven by record high production, which increased by an estimated 4.5 billion ft3/d, and less natural gas consumption in the electric power sector. Natural gas spot prices gradually rose in the final months of 2025 because of factors such as a polar vortex event in late November and early December, which briefly pushed prices above US$5.00 per million Btu.

US natural gas spot prices at most major trading hubs increased in 2025, except at the Northwest Sumas point near the US-Canada border. Two hubs in the Northeast – Algonquin Citygate near Boston and Transco Zone 6 NY near New York City – had price increases that were much more than Henry Hub’s US$1.33 per million Btu increase in 2025, according to data from Natural Gas Intelligence.

In the Northwest, the annual average natural gas spot price at Northwest Sumas fell by US$0.24 per million Btu in 2025 as ample natural gas supply from Canada coincided with less demand for natural gas-fired electricity in the Pacific Northwest region. Natural gas production in Western Canada set record highs last year, led by the Montney, a shale basin in British Columbia and Alberta.

In the Northeast, natural gas spot prices in New York (Transco Zone 6 NY) and New England (Algonquin Citygate) surged in early 2025, primarily driven by colder temperatures and supply constraints within the region’s pipeline network.

“This year, 2026, we would spend about $370,000 in electric for the wastewater treatment plant without the solar array — it’s a big ticket item in our operating budget,” Sackenheim said.
Sackenheim says Fairfield can justify the capital cost of building the solar array because of the increasing cost of electricity.
The project also is set to reduce the amount of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions that come from powering the wastewater treatment plant.
The solar array is expected to be operational by this summer.","The city of Fairfield is starting construction on its first renewable energy project.

Fairfield is breaking ground Monday on a five-acre solar array next to its wastewater treatment plant on Groh Lane. Assistant City Manager Adam Sackenheim says the solar panels will provide about 65% of the electricity needed to power the utility.

“It's going to help us save money,” Sackenheim said. “It's going to help us reduce our environmental footprint.”

Fairfield decided to pursue renewable energy initiatives and efficiency projects when city council adopted the Fairfield Sustains plan in 2024. Sackenheim says it made sense to undertake the first renewable energy project at the wastewater treatment plant because it’s the single largest energy user of all the city’s facilities.

“This year, 2026, we would spend about $370,000 in electric for the wastewater treatment plant without the solar array — it’s a big ticket item in our operating budget,” Sackenheim said.

The city expects to save $2.5 million over the solar array’s 30-year life expectancy. Melink Solar is constructing the 1.5-megawatt array.

The project costs $2.9 million. It will be paid for, in part, by a federal tax rebate.

Sackenheim says Fairfield can justify the capital cost of building the solar array because of the increasing cost of electricity.

“Where the city in the past was paying 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour for its electric energy — a very, very, very low rate — now, we're paying closer to 8 cents per kilowatt hour,” Sackenheim said. “Just in the last three to four years, our electric rates, like everyone, have doubled. And we don't see that slowing down.”

He says he hopes having the solar array will help Fairfield keep sewer rates stable.

The project also is set to reduce the amount of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions that come from powering the wastewater treatment plant.

Sustainability Program Manager Gillian Hart says Fairfield intends to do more projects like this in the future.

“Because this is our first large scale utility solar project like this, this is going to lay the groundwork for future efficiency and energy projects that pertain to our sustainability action plan,” Hart said.

The solar array is expected to be operational by this summer.

,American Energy,2026-01-12 09:10:06+00:00,Canary Media,"Finally, New England's clean-energy transmission line is ready to go",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/new-england-clean-energy-connect-come-online,"As soon as this Friday, the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line could begin commercial operations.
“This is a significant moment for clean energy in New England,” said Phelps Turner, director of clean grid for the Conservation Law Foundation.
Avangrid, the developer of the transmission line, told Maine utility regulators earlier this month that operations are scheduled to begin on Jan. 16.
The first idea for importing power from the north involved working with a planned 192-mile transmission line through New Hampshire.
Massachusetts then looked east, to Maine, to find a route for the transmission line.","Nearly 10 years after Massachusetts announced plans to buy 1.2 gigawatts of carbon-free hydropower from Canada, the clean electrons are finally set to start flowing into the state.

As soon as this Friday, the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line could begin commercial operations.

The 145-mile project, extending from the Canadian border to the southern Maine city of Lewiston, will function as something like an enormous extension cord, plugging the New England grid into a supply of electricity generated by energy giant Hydro-Québec. The new supply is expected to save the average residential customer in Massachusetts $18 to $20 per year and move the state closer to its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

“This is a significant moment for clean energy in New England,” said Phelps Turner, director of clean grid for the Conservation Law Foundation.

Avangrid, the developer of the transmission line, told Maine utility regulators earlier this month that operations are scheduled to begin on Jan. 16. Work is underway to meet that target.

“Teams are busy on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border,” said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Lynn St-Laurent. ​“We have been actively testing the equipment for the past several weeks.”

Following a tumultuous year for clean energy projects, the completion of the controversial transmission line is both a rare triumph and a case study in the challenges of balancing decarbonization and the preservation of wild lands. It’s also an uncommon example of transmission getting built in the U.S., where it has proven difficult to construct the massive power lines needed to deliver new electricity supply to population centers.

The project has its roots in a 2016 Massachusetts law that called for the state to procure 1.2 gigawatts of Canadian hydropower, or other renewables, and 1.6 gigawatts of offshore wind energy. The first idea for importing power from the north involved working with a planned 192-mile transmission line through New Hampshire. However, the project was scuttled in 2019 by public outcry against the prospect of chopping a path through some of the state’s treasured forests.

Massachusetts then looked east, to Maine, to find a route for the transmission line. Similar objections quickly arose, with opponents in the state filing a series of legal challenges. In 2021, Maine voters approved a ballot referendum effectively blocking the project. Work froze until August 2023, a few months after a jury unanimously ruled the project could move forward.

The delays spiked the project’s price tag. Before the line could start providing power, the developer, state regulators, and utilities had to come to an agreement about how those costs would be covered. In early 2025, they settled on terms that increased the price utilities would pay by a total of about $521 million, but ensured consumers would still see savings.

“The project faced many challenges over many years, and it survived all of them,” Turner said.

In addition to the modest monthly savings expected for Massachusetts utility customers, the influx of hydropower should keep rates down for consumers throughout New England by pouring lower-cost electricity into the market that will put downward pressure on prices, right at a time when rising energy bills have become a major issue, Turner said.

Questions remain, however, about how much new power the project will actually bring to the New England grid.

Hydro-Québec already sends power into the region on a separate transmission line, though these exports have decreased in recent years, even stopping almost entirely for a period in 2025. It’s possible that meeting its commitment to deliver along the New England Clean Energy Connect line will mean Hydro-Québec chooses to send less power along other pathways, said Dan Dolan, president of regional trade group the New England Power Generators Association. The net increase in clean power may be lower than anticipated.

“The change in flows over the last several years, particularly in 2025, do not leave me optimistic that Canadian hydro is here to save the day,” Dolan said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/NCEC-underway.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=98953b517535a0afc1f7c3fc200dc74e,N,,2026-01-12 08:13:49.296807

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2 percent in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.","DETROIT — General Motors plans to take a $6 billion charge to unwind some of its electric-vehicle investments, the latest carmaker to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a Jan, 8 regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor Co. announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM's writedown — a $4.2 billion cash charge — is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, which had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles.

“We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” the company said in its filing.

GM will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges this year as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but it expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

Souring bets

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on Sept. 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s largest and most profitable market. CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said last week that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

GM gained U.S. market share in 2025 on the strength of its gas-powered large pickups and SUVs, and its EVs, but some analysts have questioned the automaker's decision to focus on fully electric vehicles instead of hybrids.

""GM’s lack of hybrid exposure could partially reverse recent market share gains,"" CFRA equity analyst Garrett Nelson said in a research note on Thursday, citing the surging popularity of hybrid vehicles.

EV downturn

GM’s EV sales dropped 43 percent in the fourth quarter after the loss of the buyer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2 percent in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

The expansion concept study builds on the recently completed detailed engineering design of the company’s first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.
The concept study evaluated three investment scenarios with different modular configurations, ranging from NdFeB alloy powder production to fully integrated production including magnet finishing and packaging.
The plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create approximately 300 skilled manufacturing jobs.
Julian Treger, CoTec CEO, commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA’s Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform.""","Investing.com -- announced Monday that HyProMag USA has completed expansion concept studies and commenced pre-feasibility studies for plants in South Carolina and Nevada, marking a significant step toward tripling its domestic manufacturing capacity by 2029.

The expansion would increase total magnet and alloy production from 1,552 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) to 4,656 metric tons per year across three states, supporting the company’s scalable U.S. manufacturing strategy and reinforcing momentum toward a planned U.S. public listing.

The expanded developments show a post-tax Net Present Value (NPV) greater than $2 billion and a 38.7% real internal rate of return based on forecast market prices.

The expansion concept study builds on the recently completed detailed engineering design of the company’s first facility to be located at the Ironhead Commerce Center in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.

The Texas Hub 2025 Detailed Design base case has a post-tax NPV of $409 million based on current market prices and $780 million based on forecast prices.

The pre-feasibility studies for the South Carolina and Nevada hubs will focus on site selection, saleable products, project configuration, site layout, permitting, logistics, and technical marketing.

The expansion targets increasing production capacity threefold by 2029 across the three hubs. The concept study evaluated three investment scenarios with different modular configurations, ranging from NdFeB alloy powder production to fully integrated production including magnet finishing and packaging.

Each site was envisioned as a brownfield development with no space or utility constraints. The project schedule assumes commissioning of three plants between 2027 and 2029 and does not include an expansion of the Texas Hub.

The plants are expected to support revitalization of the U.S. magnet sector and create approximately 300 skilled manufacturing jobs. Plants in South Carolina and Nevada would be co-located with Intelligent Lifecycle Solution facilities, with expansions conditional on securing adequate feedstock and offtake.

An independent ISO-compliant study for the Texas Hub confirmed a low carbon footprint of 2.35 kg CO2-eq per kg of NdFeB sintered block product.

Julian Treger, CoTec CEO, commented: ""The Expansion Concept Study demonstrates that HyProMag USA’s Texas Hub is not a one-off project, but the foundation of a scalable U.S. manufacturing platform.""

Will Dawes, Mkango CEO, added: ""HyProMag USA continues to develop a strong platform for further growth in the United States, and the recently completed Expansion Concept Study further validates the Company’s business model and strategic positioning.""

HyProMag USA is developing advanced rare earth magnet recycling and manufacturing operations to establish a secure domestic U.S. supply chain for NdFeB magnets, essential components for AI infrastructure, defense systems, robotics, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics.

The KoAct Hydrogen Power ESS Infrastructure Active ETF offers a differentiated portfolio compared to existing secondary battery ETFs.","In response to the surging power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, major U.S. tech companies have chosen to take matters into their own hands by opting for ""direct generation"" rather than waiting for upgrades to the existing power grid. Rapidly deployable and efficient hydrogen fuel cells and energy storage system (ESS) infrastructure are emerging as key investment themes for 2026.

Samsung Active Asset Management announced on January 12 that it will list the ""KoAct Hydrogen Power ESS Infrastructure Active"" ETF on January 13, which invests in leading domestic companies specializing in hydrogen power facilities and ESS.

Due to the rapid advancement of the AI industry, U.S. electricity demand has reached its limit. According to a report by Berkeley Lab, the average wait time for power grid connections at U.S. power plants has more than doubled from 2.3 years in the 2000s to 4.8 years in 2024. For big tech firms in urgent need of electricity, large-scale nuclear or gas power plants-which take 5 to 10 years to build-are not realistic alternatives.

""On-site power"" generation, which involves building dedicated power plants right next to data centers, is drawing attention. The main sources for on-site power are solar energy, ESS, and hydrogen fuel cells, all of which can be installed within a relatively short period-about a year or less.

The ESS market is experiencing rapid growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global cumulative installation of ESS is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 21.5% through 2035, far outpacing solar (12.7%) and wind (7.7%). With North America accounting for about 30-40% of the global ESS market, domestic companies are strengthening their export momentum in this region.

The hydrogen power sector is also expanding, as major U.S. companies like Bloom Energy continue to secure large-scale orders. Following the revision of the IRA last July, companies can now receive a 30% investment tax credit even when using low-cost fuel, reducing the cost of power generation and solidifying hydrogen as a practical power procurement method for big tech firms.

Korean companies stand to benefit from the strengthened overseas entity clause in the IRA. From 2026, to qualify for tax credits, the proportion of non-Chinese components must be significantly increased. As a result, domestic battery companies such as LG and Samsung are converting their U.S. production lines for ESS use, while companies like Vinatech and Koces have officially secured orders from Bloom Energy in the United States.

The KoAct Hydrogen Power ESS Infrastructure Active ETF offers a differentiated portfolio compared to existing secondary battery ETFs. Moving beyond battery materials, it includes a significant number of ESS-specialized equipment manufacturers such as Seojin System and Hanjung NCS, as well as fuel cell component companies like Vinatech and Koces. The ETF also covers the entire infrastructure spectrum, including Doosan Enerbility, which is developing 100% hydrogen power turbines, and HRSG (Heat Recovery Steam Generator) leaders such as BHI and SNT Energy.

Kim Hyosik, Team Leader of Investment Team 2 at Samsung Active Asset Management, stated, ""2026 will mark the first year in which the competition among U.S. big tech companies to secure power expands into the construction of on-site power infrastructure.
